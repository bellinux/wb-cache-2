6000|$|... "Didn't they mention any place?" [...] demanded Dick, sternly. [...] "Come, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{us to be}} easy on you, {{you must}} tell us all you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it strikes}} me it ought to be, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to get away. Have you {{proposed}} to Beacon Street, and she thinks it rather premature on a week's acquaintance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wordsworth and his {{exquisite}} sister {{are with}} me. She {{is a woman}} indeed! in mind I mean, and heart; for her person is such, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to see a pretty woman, you would think her rather ordinary; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to see an ordinary woman, you would think her pretty! but her manners are simple, ardent, impressive. In every motion, her most innocent soul outbeams so brightly, that who saw would say, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I insinuate nothing, Mr. Pelter. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> him {{the next}} day after he was here, and he didn't come, why didn't you {{telephone}} to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, good heavens, <b>you</b> talk as <b>if</b> I made a {{habit of}} {{blacking}} up! <b>You</b> talk as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> me to come to the altar smothered in burnt cork." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Scornfully.] And do {{you think}} I'd let poor Harry be murdered so that I might be free {{to listen to your}} generous proposals? You must think I'm a fool <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to risk my neck for that.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} {{to worry}} with such friends as you have got. Put it right out of your mind until {{business}} closes to-night, for there's a big pile {{of work to be done}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to make much money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These stairs. You don't {{seem to feel}} them, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to run up and down, you'll have to {{make them}} {{shallower}} and less steep. I've been up twice since I came. I must confess to a weakness in my knee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, [...] "you talk as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to {{stay here}} ever so long, and we {{certainly}} can't do that. We should starve to death, for one thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you are rather {{disappointed}} in your evening <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to obtain {{some insight into}} our ideas," [...] said Mrs. Tarrant, {{with an air of}} impotent sympathy, to Mr. Gracie.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{buy what}} you need, just as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> {{to ride the}} ranges for me to-morrow," [...] said Naab. [...] "The first thing we ask a new man is, can he ride? Next, can he shoot?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{threatened}} {{us with a}} prefect's lickin' just now," [...] said Beetle, boldly inventing as he saw the bewilderment in {{the faces}} of the enemy. [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> you'll gain anything from us by your way of approachin' us, you're jolly well mistaken. That's all. Good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{seven o'clock}} whistle," [...] Saxon exulted. [...] "I'd lie abed {{in the mornings}} on purpose, only {{everything}} is too good not to be up. And now you just play at chopping some firewood and catching a nice big perch, Man Friday, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to get any dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Richter made an apologetic gesture. [...] "That will be impossible. I ran {{some risk}} in coming now and leave Santa Brigida to-night in a fishing boat. You {{will stay in}} this house, as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> your father back, until you hear from him. He will send you {{instructions}} when he lands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Lord, George, {{you don't}} suppose it's any novelty {{to me to}} find that we hustlers, that think we're so all-fired successful, aren't getting much out of it? <b>You</b> look as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> me to report you as seditious! You know what my own life's been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] {{she said}} in a hoarse, half-grown boy's voice. [...] "Hear me! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>expect</b> to set eyes on me again, you must find the child. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>expect</b> to speak to me again, to touch me, you must bring her back. For where she goes, I go: you hear me! Where she has gone, look for me." ...|$|R
60|$|NICOLA (going {{up close}} to her for greater emphasis). Never you mind my soul; but just listen to my advice. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{want to be a}} lady, your present {{behaviour}} to me won't do at all, unless when we're alone. It's too sharp and imprudent; and impudence is a sort of familiarity: it shews affection for me. And don't you try being high and mighty with me either. You're like all country girls: you think it's genteel to treat a servant the way I treat a stable-boy. That's only your ignorance; and don't you forget it. And don't be so ready to defy everybody. Act as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to have your own way, not as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to be ordered about. The way to get on as a lady {{is the same as the}} way to get on as a servant: you've got to know your place; that's the secret of it. And you may depend on me to know my place <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get promoted. Think over it, my girl. I'll stand by you: one servant should always stand by another.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you be in}} trouble, Besso {{will aid}} you as he has done; {{if you wish to}} buy camels, Besso will assist you as before; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> ransom for his charge, whom you ought to have placed on your best mare of Nedgid, then I have not brought a para.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{said one}} of them; [...] "we know him all right. Glad to meet a man who's a friend of his; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a job here, you don't want to mention it. If another fellow of that kind comes along, the boss will get after him with a gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much for {{allowing}} me to interrupt you," [...] said Dorothea, immediately. [...] "I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find him, or even allow me to wait for him, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> him soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have spent}} a good many years {{building}} roads and bridges {{in various parts of}} the Dominion, and have never seen better work than you have shown me to-day," [...] he said. [...] "Now I don't quite know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> me to talk business on this occasion, but I'm going out early to-morrow, and I fancy your good ladies are as anxious as you are about the welfare of Somasco." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ahuh! I reckon {{you think}} you can. But not hyar at White Slides. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>expect</b> to get this {{property}} you'll not do as you like.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "one of those silk-purse-from a sow's ear exercises, fairly {{absorbing}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{go to it}} casually, but possibly a cheat <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go <b>expecting</b> {{the last word in}} civilised movie expense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] exclaimed Maxwell. [...] "It is not {{the plague}} he fears the most. In fact, {{considering}} {{that he must have}} lived through one or two outbreaks already, part, at least, of his fear must have been simulated. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to see Rideau here again on the old terms, Hilton, you are mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bittridge left Kenton {{to imagine}} the desperate case, {{and in spite of}} his disbelief in the man and all he said, Kenton could not keep his {{hardness}} of heart towards him. [...] "I don't know what you're after, young man," [...] he began. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to receive you under my roof again--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well, my dear Sir, very well,' replied Perker, 'I {{can only}} say that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame or {{confusion}} at having to look you, or anybody else, in the face, you are the most sanguine man in your expectations that I ever met with. Show them in, Mr. Lowten.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} learned," [...] he said, [...] "from some men who {{live by the}} side of the great water, that your husband {{followed}} you up the Ugambi for several marches, when he was at last set upon by natives and killed. Therefore I have told you this that you might not waste your time in a long journey <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to meet your husband at the end of it; but instead could turn and retrace your steps to the coast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your aunt, Mr. North, speaks excitedly," [...] {{said the}} elder gentleman; [...] "yet I think {{she does not}} {{overestimate}} the unfortunate position in which your odd fancy places you. I know nothing {{of the reasons that}} have impelled you to this step; I only know that the popular opinion is that the cause is utterly inadequate. You are still young, with a future before you. I need not say how your present conduct may imperil that. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to achieve any good--even to your own satisfaction--but this conduct--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll {{tell the}} truth in extremity, of course, and he'll tell it if it's pleasant, always; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>expect</b> much more of him you won't be disappointed; {{and you can make}} him of great use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I {{told him}} once, {{but he says}} money ain't the thing--or {{not the only thing}} you got to give to them poor folks. You got to give your time and your {{knowledge}} and your love--I don't know what all you got to give yourself, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to help 'em. That's what Coonrod says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These stairs. You don't {{seem to feel}} them, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to run up and down, you'll have to {{make them}} {{shallower}} and less steep. I've been up twice since I came; Hilda insisted on my seeing the new decorations in the west wing, and I must confess to a weakness in my knee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, Master Marner," [...] {{said the}} landlord, now rising resolutely, and seizing Marner by the shoulder, [...] "if you've got any {{information}} to lay, speak it out sensible, and show as you're in your right mind, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> anybody {{to listen to}} you. You're as wet as a drownded rat. Sit down and dry yourself, and speak straight forrard." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{six years}} after his return from France before Wordsworth finally settled down in the scenes with which his name {{and the power of}} his genius were to be for ever associated. During this {{interval}} it was that two great sources of personal influence were opened to him. He entered upon that close and beloved companionship with his sister, which remained unbroken to the end of their days; and he first made the acquaintance of Coleridge. The character of Dorothy Wordsworth has long taken its place in the gallery of admirable and devoted women who have inspired the work and the thoughts of great men. [...] "She is a woman, indeed," [...] said Coleridge, [...] "in mind I mean, and heart; for her person is such that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to see a pretty woman, you would think her rather ordinary; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> to see an ordinary woman, you would think her pretty." [...] To the solidity, sense, and strong intelligence of the Wordsworth stock she added a grace, a warmth, a liveliness peculiarly her own. Her nature shines transparent in her letters, in her truly admirable journal, and in every report that we have of her. Wordsworth's own feelings for her, and his sense of the debt that he owed to her faithful affection and eager mind, he has placed on lasting record.|$|R
6000|$|... "My mind misgives me much," [...] said Mr. Lorry, angrily {{shaking a}} {{forefinger}} at him, [...] "that you {{have used the}} respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, {{and that you have}} had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have, don't <b>expect</b> me to befriend you when you get back to England. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have, don't <b>expect</b> me to keep your secret. Tellson's shall not be imposed upon." ...|$|R
5000|$|From prison {{he sent a}} {{range of}} letters {{to his wife and}} said of his actions: [...] "You would not be my wife <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>expected</b> {{something}} different from me". In February 1945 he was sentenced to death for treason and was sentenced to be shot by a firing squad at the Dachau concentration camp. However he fell ill with dysentery, and en route on the train (he was with 40 others sentenced to the camp), died in the morning of 24 February 1945. When his corpse was discovered in the train, he was found with the Bible and a rosary with him.|$|R
