25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (<b>drive)</b> <b>side</b> of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E
6000|$|When the {{confusion}} of tongues took place at Babel, and men were dispersed, the sons of Ham's grandson, Cush, remained in Mesopotamia, which took the name of Assyria, from Assur, the officer of Nimrod, the first king. This Assur began building, {{on the banks of}} the Tigris, the great city of Nineveh, one of the mightiest in all the world, and the first to be ruined. It was enclosed by a huge wall, so wide that three chariots could <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> by side on the top, and built of bricks made of the clay of the country, dried in the sun and cemented with bitumen, guarded at the base by a plinth fifty feet in height, and with immense ditches round it, about sixty miles in circumference. Within were huge palaces, built of the same bricks, faced with alabaster, and the rooms decked with cedar, gilding, and ivory, and raised upon terraces whence broad flights of steps led down to courts guarded by giant stone figures of bulls and lions, with eagles' wings and human faces, as if some notion of the mysterious Cherubim around the Throne in Heaven had floated to these Assyrians. The slabs against the walls were carved with representations of battles, hunts, sacrifices, triumphs, and all the scenes in the kings' histories, nay, in the building of the city; and there were explanations in the wedge-shaped letters of the old Assyrian alphabet. The Ninevites had numerous idols, but their honour for the Lord had not quite faded away; and about the year 830, about the time of Amaziah in Judah, and Jeroboam II. in Israel, the prophet Jonah was sent to rebuke them for their many iniquities. In trying to avoid the command, by sailing to Tarshish in a Phoenician ship, he underwent that strange punishment which was a prophetic sign of our Lord's Burial and Resurrection; and thus warned, he went to Nineveh and startled the people by the cry, [...] "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed!" [...] At that cry, the whole place repented as one man; and from the king to the beggar all fasted and wept, till God had mercy on their repentance and ready faith, and turned away His wrath, in pity to the 120,000 innocent children who knew not yet to do good or evil.|$|E

50|$|Quintana Roo SHIFT {{technology}} is the diverting of air away from the dirty (<b>drive)</b> <b>side</b> of the bike towards the clean (non-drive) side of the bike. The non-drive side of the downtube is offset towards the <b>drive</b> <b>side,</b> thus directing airflow away from the drag-heavy drivetrain components. By creating an offset downtube, airflow off the back edge of the front wheel is free to flow {{along the side of}} the downtube, instead of crashing against it, as with a traditional downtube. This results in a more balanced drag curve, which leads to increased stability in crosswinds and headwinds.|$|E

Instead, Colin traps Hothan's forces in normal space (again, using the Enchanach <b>Drive's</b> <b>side</b> effect to exploit the hyperdrive's limitation of being unable to work in a sufficiently deep gravity well). With a good deal of luck and a well-timed planetoid assault on the flank, the Achuultani command structure disintegrates and they are routed.|$|R

50|$|A hole in an arm {{attached}} to the bottom bracket shell snaps onto a pin {{attached to}} the <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> of the lower seat tube (part of the main frame), locking the rear end in place.

Finally, a cap on the end of a screw attached to the stem slides into a slot on the <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> of the mainframe, securing it. This allows the bike to be picked up as one piece without unfolding and also allows the bike to wheel around by the front wheel, unlike the other Bike Fridays.|$|E

However, Dongmen Road is not far from Yuyuan Garden, an elaborate traditional garden in the Jiangnan style, {{and one of the}} tourist sites of Shanghai.

5000|$|... "Hollowtech II" [...] - This was {{the next}} {{iteration}} after Hollowtech cranks. For this system the bottom bracket axle was fused to the <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> crank and the non <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> crank fitted on a spline on the axle using pinch bolts. The bottom bracket bearings sat outside the BB shell in the frame, allowing the BB axle to be a larger diameter, making it stiffer and lighter. The bearing reliability of this system remains quite variable compared to previous Shimano cartridge BB's as Hollowtech II bearing alignment is {{at the mercy of}} the alignment of the BB shell threads and the facing of the BB shell rather than factory set by Shimano in the case of the cartridge BB's. Race face make a system with compatible bearings which they call X-Type.|$|E
5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the <b>drive</b> <b>side.</b> At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the <b>drive</b> <b>side</b> of the rear wheel.|$|E

Accelerated foils showed significant filamentation on the rear-side (away from the driving laser) of the foil, although the laser beam was smoothed. In {{addition to the}} narrow rear-side filamentation, some shots revealed larger-scale plume-like structures on the front (<b>driven)</b> <b>side</b> of the Al foil. These plumes seem to be little-affected by beam smoothing and are likely a consequence of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The experiments were carried out at the Nova two-beam facility...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the non-equilibrium fluid structure mediated forces between two colloids driven through a suspension of mutually non-interacting Brownian particles {{as well as}} between a colloid and a wall in stationary situations. We solve the Smoluchowski equation in bispherical coordinates as well as with a method of reflections, both in linear approximation for small velocities and numerically for intermediate velocities, and we compare the results to a superposition approximation considered previously. In particular we find an enhancement of the friction (compared to the friction on an isolated particle) for two colloids <b>driven</b> <b>side</b> by side as well as for a colloid traveling along a wall. The friction on tailgating colloids is reduced. Colloids traveling side by side experience a solute induced repulsion while tailgating colloids are attracted to each other.
