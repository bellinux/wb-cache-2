2500|$|Richard Fass puts {{forward the}} {{possibility}} that business scandals {{in the real world}} make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. [...] Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>students,</b> there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: [...] "It is not that we love honesty less, but that we love success more." [...] Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, {{it has been shown that}} the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fight against}} secret {{societies}} among students again raised its head. [...] In May 1926, the school issued one year suspensions to 53 students under {{the claim that}} their Sunday school classes served as a front for fraternity membership. [...] The boys filed suit against the school claiming {{that they did not}} know they would be punished so strongly, with one prominent parent claiming the school was acting to erase its image as an [...] "athletic" [...] school. [...] When the boys won the case, they arrived at school to gain admittance, only to see the Superintendent cancel classes so that students could attend a [...] "clean alleys" [...] parade. [...] Upon appeal, the judge reversed his initial ruling, and denied the boys' lawsuit. [...] Despite missing graduation <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>students,</b> the remaining students continued to appeal throughout the summer. [...] On 4 September, the parties arrived at a compromise where graduates would receive their diplomas, underclassmen would return to class, though students would be barred from extracurricular activities, and would be required to help root out secret societies. [...] Parents who had started a petition drive against the principal were also required to destroy the petitions.|$|E
2500|$|High {{school counselors}} provide academic, career, college access, and {{personal}} and social competencies with developmental classroom lessons and planning to all students, and individual and group counseling <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>students</b> and their families to meet the developmental needs of adolescents (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005, 2012). Emphasis is on college access counseling at the early high school level as more school counseling programs move to evidence-based work with data and specific results that show how school counseling programs help to close achievement, opportunity, and attainment gaps ensuring all students have access to school counseling programs and early college access activities. The breadth of demands high school counselors face, from educational attainment (high school graduation and some students' preparation for careers and college) to student social and mental health, has led to ambiguous role definition. Summarizing a 2011 national {{survey of more than}} 5,300 {{middle school and high school}} counselors, researchers argued: [...] "Despite the aspirations of counselors to effectively help students succeed in school and fulfill their dreams, the mission and roles of counselors in the education system must be more clearly defined; schools must create measures of accountability to track their effectiveness; and policymakers and key stakeholders must integrate counselors into reform efforts to maximize their impact in schools across America".|$|E

2500|$|But Roberts {{distinguished}} Grutter {{from this}} case, {{and argued that}} this case was more similar to Gratz v. Bollinger. In Grutter, the interest was student body diversity [...] "in the context of higher education," [...] and was not focused on race alone but encompassed [...] "all factors that may contribute to student body diversity". [...] The Grutter Court quoted the articulation of diversity from Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, noting that [...] "it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage {{of the student body}} is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race." [...] What was upheld in Grutter was consideration of [...] "a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element." [...] "The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not simply {{as a member of a}} particular racial group." [...] As the Grutter Court explained, [...] "he importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount." [...] The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the Grutter Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court explained would be [...] "patently unconstitutional." [...] In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve [...] "exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints," [...] ibid.; race, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>students,</b> is determinative standing alone. [...] Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/"other" [...] terms in Jefferson County. [...] "The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out. Upon enrolling their child with the district, parents are required to identify their child as a member of a particular racial group. If a parent identifies more than one race on the form, [...] "he application will not be accepted and, if necessary, the enrollment service person taking the application will indicate one box.""

2500|$|In 1956, he {{released}} his first record, Fados de Coimbra. In 1956 and 1957, {{he became a}} teacher {{and worked in the}} south of Portugal. Due to his financial problems he sent his children to the Portuguese overseas territory of Mozambique in 1958, where his parents were at the time. In that year he became enthralled by Humberto Delgado's presidential campaign; Delgado lost due to massive fraud perpetrated by the authoritarian Estado Novo regime. In 1959, he started singing in his trademark musical style, colored with political and social connotations, in many popular groups around the country. This granted him a growing popularity among the working class and the rural population. In 1960 his fourth record, Balada do Outono (Autumn Ballad), was released. From 1961 to 1962 he paid close attention to the student strikes and demonstrations demanding democracy {{and the end of the}} authoritarian Estado Novo regime, which were brutally repressed by the police. He continued releasing many of his songs and introduced important new guitar arrangements. He played in Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden, in a fado guitar group with Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Niza, Jorge Godinho, Durval Moreirinhas and the singer Esmeralda Amoedo. In May 1964, José Afonso played in the Musical Society Workers' Brotherhood in Grândola, where he found the inspiration to compose the song [...] "Grândola, Vila Morena", which would be the signal (broadcast by the national radio channel) for the start of the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Also in 1964 the album Baladas e Canções was released. From 1964 to 1967, José Afonso was in Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) and Beira, Mozambique, with Zélia (his second wife); there he reunited with his children. In his last two years in the overseas province he taught in Beira, and composed music for the Bertolt Brecht play The Exception and The Rule. In 1965 his daughter Joana was born. In 1967 he returned to Lisbon, marked by the colonial reality and by the Portuguese Colonial War against the independence-seeking guerrilla movement of Mozambique, Frelimo. However, he left his older son, José Manuel, with the latter's grandparents in Mozambique. José Afonso became a teacher in Setúbal; after that he developed a severe health crisis which left him hospitalized for 20 days. When he left the hospital, he found that he had been expelled from public school teaching because of his leftist politics and because the regime's censors considered his songs strongly subversive. His book Cantares de José Afonso (José Afonso's songs) was published. The Portuguese Communist Party invited him personally to become a party member but Zeca refused because of his bourgeois origins. In that year he signed a contract with the Orfeu label, which would record 70% of his works. Expelled from the teaching job, he became a private tutor <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>students</b> and he started singing much more regularly in the popular groups on the south bank of the Tagus river, Margem Sul do Tejo, a fiercely Communist-supporting region that even before the revolution had strong local movements and associations, and which remains to this day, a stronghold of the Communist Party. For Christmas, Zeca released the album Cantares do Andarilho, with Rui Pato, the first album recorded for Orfeu. His contract was very special: he received 15,000 escudos per month on ...|$|E
