40|$|This {{treatise}} {{provides a}} record of the stratigraphy and structure in the southernmost extension of the Witwatersrand System and is based on the results obtained from bore-hole cores and from detailed mapping underground. Several <b>disconformities</b> encountered in these sediments are interpreted as marginal <b>disconformities</b> of a geosynclinal basin. It is contended that the bankets were formed in neritic and littoral environments closely associated with profiles of equilibrium., such as <b>disconformities,</b> where conditions favour the concentration of heavy minerals, including gold and uraninite. The composite radiometric log of the area south of the Sand river, drawn up by Dr. D. J. Simpson in 1951, is revised by including into it the portion of the log of bore-hole K. A. 2 in which the Intermediate Reefs occur. Chloritoid is confined to the Lower Footwall beds, the Khaki Shale Marker and the Upper Shale Marker. The variation of the optical properties of chloritic minerals indicate that a wide range of these minerals exist in the sediments. Pyritic stringers appear to be natural concentrations of such heavy minerals as pyrite, ilmenite, chromite and zircon. Heavy mineral investigations, to be of correlative value, {{in the case of the}} Witwatersrand System would require considerable basic research. Intrusive rocks have been classified under the following types ranging from the youngest to the oldest:- dolerite, epidiorite, uralite diabase, pyroxene diabase, chlorite diabase and Ventersdorp diabase.

40|$|In the Janabah {{region of}} southeastern Oman, Oligocene/Miocene limestones of the Shuwayr, Warak and Ghubbarrah {{formations}} are widely exposed. They were deposited on an extensive shallow carbonate platform {{that was part}} of the Arabian Shelf and located on the Gulf of Aden's northeastern rift shoulder, which emerged during the Early Miocene. The uppermost part of the studied sedimentary succession developed immediately before the permanently subaerial exposure of the carbonate platform. Cyclic changes of intertidal and subtidal facies document a fluctuating relative sea level at different frequencies and a continuous decline of accommodation. Single erosive surfaces with palaeokarst cavities and caliche crusts separate larger depositional cycles. These <b>disconformities</b> imply relatively long episodes of subaerial exposure and are interpreted to have been formed during lowstands of third-order sea level cycles that denuded the platform.

40|$|Drilling at Bougainville Guyot (Ocean Drilling Program Site 831), New Hebrides Island Arc during Leg 134 {{revealed}} that 727. 5 m of carbonate overlies an andesite basement. The carbonate cap at Site 831 consists of 20 m of pelagic carbonate overlying 707. 5 m of neritic carbonates. The neritic section consists of ~ 230 m of largely unaltered aragonite sediment that overlies ~ 497 m of totally calcitized limestone. The deeper {{portion of the}} calcitized interval has been pervasively altered by diagenesis. Prior to this study the age distribution of sediments at Bougainville Guyot was poorly known because age diagnostic fossils are sparsely and discontinuously distributed in the sequence. We have used Sr isotopes to provide temporal constraints on the deposition of carbonates at Site 831; these constraints are critical in reconstructing the vertical movement of Bougainville Guyot before its collision with the New Hebrides Island Arc. Overall, the chronostratigraphy of Bougainville Guyot can be subdivided into three intervals: (1) a Pleistocene interval (102. 4 to 391. 11 meters below sea floor [mbsf]); (2) a Miocene interval (410. 31 to 669. 53 mbsf); and (3) an Oligocene interval (678. 83 to 727. 50 mbsf). Strontium isotopic ages of samples increase with increasing depth in the carbonate sequence, except {{near the bottom of}} the sequence, where several samples exhibit a consistent reversed age vs. depth trend. Such age reversals are most likely the product of post-depositional rock-water interaction. Preliminary stable isotope data are consistent with diagenetic alteration in the marine and meteoric environments. Several abrupt decreases in d 87 Sr, and hence age, of sediments are recognized in the carbonate cap at Bougainville Guyot. These <b>disconformities</b> are most likely the product of subaerial exposure in response to relative sea-level fall.

Together with microfossil stratigraphy, our results indicate that some seamount crusts greatly exceed the commonly accepted Miocene maximum age, in this case probably approaching the Cretaceous age of the seamount. In addition to the unconformity at the crust-substrate boundary, at least eight major <b>disconformities</b> are indicated in the Schumann Seamount crust which probably represent depositional hiatuses or episodes of crust erosion. Three of the six upper <b>disconformities</b> can be placed at the Plio-Pleistocene, Middle Miocene and Paleocene-Eocene based on 10 Be, microfossil and Co chronometer evidence. 87 Sr 86 Sr and δ 18 O values of purified francolite from an inclusion-rich layer between the depths of 44 and 49 mm suggest apparent ages that approach those of Eocene-Late Paleocene microfossils reported in overlying layers, whereas francolite vein infillings in {{the lower part of}} the crust and in the basaltic substrate yield values that, if interpreted as ages of phosphatization, suggest a minimum Oligocene age. Paleotracking suggests the phosphogenesis observed here and on other Central Pacific seamounts could not have resulted from upwelling enhanced productivity associated with equatorial divergence if the Oligocene and Middle Miocene isotopic ages reported here and elsewhere are correct; however, a maximum Late Paleocene age for the phosphogenesis, consistent with the stratigraphy, would place these seamounts within 10 °N of the equator.

40|$|The Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation and the {{overlying}} Sharon Springs Member of the Pierre Shale are two {{of several}} organic-carbon (OC) rich units deposited in the Western interior seaway. A key to assessing the validity of models proposed to account for OC enrichment in these units is understanding the three-dimensional (3 D) distribution of OC within these units. Within the study area abundant subsurface data {{in the form of}} geophysical well logs are available. These logs were used to divide the Niobrara and Sharon Springs into regionally correlatable chronostratigraphic horizons and to estimate OC-content. By combining these elements a 3 D picture of the OC-distribution was obtained. This distribution was compared to changes in lithology, sedimentation rate, and tectonic activity. The Niobrara and Sharon Springs contain local and regional <b>disconformities</b> which indicate water depths were near an estimated storm-wave base depth of 100 m. Local <b>disconformities</b> in the Niobrara are indicative of basinal tectonic activity that is linked to Sevier thrusting to the west. Large-scale Niobrara chalk/marl cycles also appear to be linked to Sevier thrusting. There is a regular vertical pattern of OC enrichment in the Niobrara, but no pronounced regional patterns are evident. Estimated paleoproductivities are moderate, except to the southeast where higher productivities may have been a consequence of upwelling. Small-scale chalk/marl cycles result from alternation of high productivity during periods of fairly vigorous circulation (chalks) with low productivity during periods of more sluggish circulation (marls). The regional diachrony of the Sharon Springs facies was a result of clastic dilution associated with progradation from the west and the paleobathymetry. Paleoproductivities were moderately high during Sharon Springs deposition, but there is no conclusive evidence of upwelling. Both units were deposited beneath bottom waters that were on average dysoxic, but oxygenation levels varied intermittently from fully oxic to anoxic. These changes were climatically modulated.
