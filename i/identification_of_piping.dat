40|$|AISI 316 / 316 L has {{traditionally}} been used in offshore topside environments when operating under low temperatures. It has been observed that the AISI 316 / 316 L piping suffer from severe attacks of pitting and crevice corrosion on external surfaces. It is therefore important to emphasise the comments within the statements that give the limitations {{on the use of}} the material. While temperature is the main parameter in the standards, there seem to be others, such as location, presence of tags and coating, which affect the initiation and propagation of pitting and crevice corrosion. This thesis discusses the various operating parameters that affect the susceptibility to pitting and crevice corrosion of AISI 316 / 316 L piping and proposes procedures for identifying piping that are most prone to attack, and calculations of the probability of failure of such piping. In the first part of the thesis, a literature survey of the parameters that affect the pitting and crevice corrosion of AISI 316 / 316 L in an offshore environment is presented. In the second part, a procedure for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>piping</b> that is prone to pitting and crevice corrosion is presented. This procedure has been developed taking into consideration the parameters that are assumed to be important and suitable for use in RBI analysis. In the first step, the parameters that affect both pitting and crevice corrosion, that is, the chloride content due to the location of the pipe, coating and temperature, were considered to be the most important ones. In the second step, the possibility of crevice corrosion was assessed. In the third part, a procedure for assessing the possibility of pitting corrosion in the offshore topside environment based on the pitting potential was developed. The temperature of the external pipe surface was used to find the solubility of NaCl in water. The chloride concentration was used to determine the in order to find the possibility of pitting in the topside offshore environment. The last step was to develop a procedure for calculating the probability of failure of a pipe as a function of time. In this step, the functional life of the coating and the rate of pitting corrosion have been considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo identificar os impactos da urbanizaÃÂÃÂo em Guarapuava na morfologia de cursos fluviais na bacia hidrogrÃÂfica do Rio Cascavel. As discussÃÂes foram centradas em cinco aspectos metodolÃÂgicos principais sendo: mensuraÃÂÃÂo dos aspectos geomÃÂtricos das seÃÂÃÂes transversais abertas e fechadas; coleta e caracterizaÃÂÃÂo de sedimentos de leito; monitoramento do regime fluvial; identificaÃÂÃÂo das classes de canalizaÃÂÃÂo e o mapeamento da expansÃÂo urbana de Guarapuava e das seÃÂÃÂes interceptadas por arruamento. A bacia do Rio Cascavel possui cerca de 40 % da sua ÃÂrea ocupada pela urbanizaÃÂÃÂo de Guarapuava, sendo que vÃÂrios canais de primeira ordem apresentam ÃÂreas de nascentes urbanizadas e/ou semi-urbanizadas. Esses canais fluem em subsuperfÃÂcies, revelando alteraÃÂÃÂo nÃÂo apenas pontuais das seÃÂÃÂes, mas tambÃÂm ao longo do perfil longitudinal. Os levantamentos revelaram que cerca de 30 % dos trechos fluviais urbanos encontram-se canalizados, com alteraÃÂÃÂes morfolÃÂgicas que alteram a dinÃÂmica dos fluxos. VÃÂrias seÃÂÃÂes fechadas sobrepostas por ruas apresentaram acÃÂmulo de sedimentos (tecnogÃÂnicos e naturais), e de arbustos, favorecendo a diminuiÃÂÃÂo da capacidade das seÃÂÃÂes, formando zonas de retenÃÂÃÂo de ÃÂgua nos eventos de chuva. A percentagem de sedimentos tecnogÃÂnicos das amostras de leito coletadas na ÃÂrea urbana apresentou pouca variaÃÂÃÂo com uma mediana de 18, 01 %. Os levantamentos das propriedades geomÃÂtricas dos canais urbanos evidenciaram desajustes morfolÃÂgicos, com alargamento dos trechos urbanos cerca de trÃÂs vezes maiores que os rurais. Os dados do monitoramento da vazÃÂo mostraram que a ÃÂrea urbana apresentou uma vazÃÂo especÃÂfica 2, 66 vezes a vazÃÂo da ÃÂrea rural, o que condiciona maior energia no fluxo e vazÃÂes mÃÂximas superiores potencializando alteraÃÂÃÂo na geometria dos canais e a ocorrÃÂncia de enchentes e inundaÃÂÃÂes urbanas. The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the impacts of urbanization in the morphology of Guarapuava waterways in the Rattlesnake River basin. The discussions were focused on five main methodological aspects being:measurement of geometric aspects of open and closed cross sections, collection and characterization of sediment bed; monitoring of river system, <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>piping</b> classes and mapping urban sprawland sections of Guarapuava intersected by streets. The Cascavel River watershed has about 40 % of its area occupied by the urbanization of Guarapuava, of which multiple canals of first-order present headwater areas urbanized and/or semi-urbanized. These canals flow into sub-surfaces, revealing changing not only on specific sections, but also along the longitudinal profile. The surveys revealed that about 30 % of the urban fluvial stretches are canalized, with morphological changes that alter the dynamic of the flux. Several enclosed sections overlaid with streets showed accumulation of sediment (technogenic and natural), and of bushes, favoring to reduce the capacity of sections, forming zones of water retention in the events of rain. The percentage of technogenic sediments of bed samples collected in urban areas showed little variation {{with an average of}} 18, 01 %. The surveys of the geometric properties of urban canals showed morphological misfits, with enlargement of urban stretches about three times higher than rural. The data of the flow monitoring showed that the urban area presented a specific flow rate 2. 66 times the flow rate of the rural area, what conditions more energy in the flux and maximum flow rates higher leveraging change in the canal geometry and in the occurrence of flooding and urban inundation...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) in the early 1960 s, it has been adopted for use in numerous applications, from topographical mapping with airborne LIDAR platforms to surveying of urban sites with terrestrial LIDAR systems. Static terrestrial LIDAR has become an especially effective tool for surveying, in some cases replacing traditional techniques such as electronic total stations and GPS methods. Current state-of-the-art LIDAR scanners have very fine spatial resolution, generating precise 3 D point cloud data with millimeter accuracy. Therefore, LIDAR data can provide 3 D details of a scene with an unprecedented level of details. However, automated exploitation of LIDAR data is challenging, due to the non-uniform spatial sampling of the point clouds {{as well as to the}} massive volumes of data, which may range from a few million points to hundreds of millions of points depending on the size and complexity of the scene being scanned. ^ This dissertation focuses on addressing these challenges to automatically exploit large LIDAR point clouds of piping systems in industrial sites, such as chemical plants, oil refineries, and steel mills. A complete processing chain is proposed in this work, using raw LIDAR point clouds as input and generating cylinder parameter estimates for pipe segments as the output, which could then be used to produce computer aided design (CAD) models of pipes. The processing chain consists of three stages: (1) segmentation of LIDAR point clouds, (2) detection and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>piping</b> elements, and (3) cylinder fitting and parameter estimation. The final output of the cylinder fitting stage gives the estimated orientation, position, and radius of each detected pipe element. ^ A robust octree-based split and merge segmentation algorithm is proposed in this dissertation that can efficiently process LIDAR data. Following octree decomposition of the point cloud, graph theory analysis is used during the splitting process to separate points within each octant into components based on spatial connectivity. A series of connectivity criteria (proximity, orientation, and curvature) are developed for the merging process, which exploits contextual information to effectively merge cylindrical segments into complete pipes and planar segments into complete walls. Furthermore, by conducting surface fitting of segments and analyzing their principal curvatures, the proposed segmentation approach is capable of detecting and identifying the piping segments. ^ A novel cylinder fitting technique is proposed to accurately estimate the cylinder parameters for each detected piping segment from the terrestrial LIDAR point cloud. Specifically, the orientation, radius, and position of each piping element must be robustly estimated in the presence of noise. An original formulation has been developed to estimate the cylinder axis orientation using gradient descent optimization of an angular distance cost function. The cost function is based on the concept that surface normals of points in a cylinder point cloud are perpendicular to the cylinder axis. The key contribution of this algorithm is its capability to accurately estimate the cylinder orientation in the presence of noise without requiring a good initial starting point. After estimation of the cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s axis orientation, the radius and position are then estimated in the 2 D space formed from the projection of the 3 D cylinder point cloud onto the plane perpendicular to the cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s axis. With these high quality approximations, a least squares estimation in 3 D is made for the final cylinder parameters. ^ Following cylinder fitting, the estimated parameters of each detected piping segment are used to generate a CAD model of the piping system. The algorithms and techniques in this dissertation form a complete processing chain that can automatically exploit large LIDAR point cloud of piping systems and generate CAD models. ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that automation can improve industrial pipe lifting productivity. However, there is little information on finding how much productivity can be improved in the other parts of pipe erection processes to coordinate with the productivity improvement in pipe lifting.

For efficient and exhaustive measurement <b>of</b> the <b>piping</b> system, the scanner should be placed at optimum positions where the occluded parts <b>of</b> the <b>piping</b> system are captured as much as possible in less scans.
