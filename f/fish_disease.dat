40|$|Fishes {{not only}} play an {{important}} role in the demand of food for humans but they have also emerged as major model organisms for different biomedical researches. A number of experiments with the use of several drugs have been conducted in <b>fish.</b> <b>Diseases</b> in <b>fish</b> caused by bacteria are most widespread. Antibiotics are frequently used to control <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by bacteria, but there is an increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The medicinal plants can act as immunostimulants, conferring early activation to the non-specific defense mechanisms of fish and elevating the specific immune response. The herbs contain many immunologically active components such as polysaccharides, organic acids, alkaloids, glycosides and volatile oils, which can enhance immune functions. Recently, there has been increased interest in the immune stimulating function of some herbs in aquaculture. The non-specific immune functions such as bacteriolytic activity and leukocyte function of fish have been improved by some herbs. Henceforth, this article elucidates certain herbs (medicinal plants) which have been shown experimentally as well as clinically to possess immunostimulant effects in fish, thereby treating different <b>fish</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Similar {{to other}} animals, fish can also suffer from {{different}} <b>diseases.</b> All <b>fish</b> carry pathogens and parasites. Disease {{is a prime}} agent affecting fish mortality, especially when fish are young. Pathogens which can cause <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> comprise: viral infections, bacterial infections, fungal infections, protozoan infections, water mould infection, etc. Fish are also exposed from different environmental pollutants, including drugs and chemicals. The most common <b>fish</b> <b>diseases,</b> particularly in freshwater aquaria, include columnaris, gill disease, ick (ich), dropsy, tail and fin-rot, fungal infections, white spot disease, pop-eye, cloudy eye, swim bladder disease, lice and nematode worms infestation, water quality induced diseases, constipation, anorexia, chilodonella, ergasilus, tuberculosis, glugea, henneguya, hexamita, hole-in-the-head disease, injuries, leeches in aquaria, lymphocystis, marine velvet, and neon-tetra disease, etc. Antibiotics are frequently used to control <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by bacteria, {{but there is an}} increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.

50|$|Many {{of these}} {{interactions}} and effects cause {{stress in the}} fish, {{which can be a}} major factor in facilitating <b>fish</b> <b>disease.</b> For many parasites, infestation depends on the host's degree of mobility, the density of the host population and vulnerability of the host's defence system. Sea lice are the primary parasitic problem for finfish in aquaculture, high numbers causing widespread skin erosion and haemorrhaging, gill congestion, and increased mucus production. There are also a number of prominent viral and bacterial pathogens that can have severe effects on internal organs and nervous systems.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY – As {{aquaculture}} assumes {{an expanding}} role in meeting consumer demands for fishery products, {{it is natural}} that they meet safety and quality standards. In addition to residues of agro-chemicals, veterinary drugs and heavy metal organic and inorganic contamination, infectious <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> represent {{one of the most}} important problems and challenges in aquaculture production, both from an economic and sanitary point of view. Diseases increase cost and reduce profit because of loss in dead fish, cost of treatment or decreased growth rate of diseased and convalescent fish. The fish is usually exposed to pathogens or potential pathogens, but in <b>fish</b> <b>diseases,</b> a simple association between the pathogen and the host fish does not occur. Environmenta...|$|R

50|$|Ammonia {{poisoning}} is {{a common}} <b>fish</b> <b>disease</b> in new aquariums, especially when immediately stocked to full capacity. Ideally, the level of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium compounds (i.e. those containing NH4+) should be zero. Although trace amounts are generally harmless, they can still lead to problems over time. Understanding the nitrogen cycle {{is essential for the}} keeping of any aquatic life. The amount of ammonia present is usually accompanied by a rise in pH. As ammonia is a base, it is stabilized by alkaline water. It can cause damage to the gills at a level as small as 0.25 mg/L.|$|E

40|$|Results from annual surveys since 1995, in the European Union (EU) {{and some}} {{neighbouring}} {{states on the}} epidemiological situation of <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> listed in Council Directive 91 / 67 /EEC Annex A, and on other emerging <b>fish</b> <b>diseases,</b> forms {{the basis of this}} paper. The production of cultured finfish is expanding in EU. From 1995 to 2000 total aquaculture production increased 60 % to approximately 520 000 tonnes in 2000. The traditional emphasis on rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) and salmon (Salmo salar) production shifted during those years to include other species – of particular mention are seabream (Sparus aurata) and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the rapidly growing Mediterranean aquaculture industry. ISA entered the Community in 1998, but appears to have departed again after prompt implementation of control measures given in Council Directive 93 / 53 /EEC, thus regaining its status as an exotic disease in EU. The ongoing efforts of surveillance for notifiable <b>fish</b> <b>diseases</b> on list II, and the associated ensuing trade regulations between approved and non-approved zones have in most cases successfully contained those diseases. The trend is for an increasing number of zones and countries to move towards approval for freedom of notifiable diseases...|$|R
