5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E

It is unknown if an open source project will become usable, especially when a project is started without significant support {{from one or}} more organizations.

25|$|However, since {{mid to late}} 2010, the U.S. Treasury {{has been}} obtaining {{negative}} real interest rates at Treasury security auctions. At such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money according to one economist. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that such rates will continue, but the trend has remained falling or flat as of October 2012.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 2016, Lac-Mégantic Town Council {{decided not}} to pursue legal action against Canadian Pacific, citing the costs {{involved}} in doing so and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> of a successful outcome.|$|R

The FAQ {{goes on to say}} there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that an edit was made by an authorized user rather than an intruder. The likelihood of such intrusions depend upon an organizations' network security, organizations such as the Vatican Library have public access terminals or networks.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> of {{how much}} money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an {{accounting}} scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having {{the value of their}} bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{through the early}} 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking {{advantage}} of negative real interest rates, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that government debt rates will continue to stay so low. Between 1946 and 1974, the US debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 121% to 32% even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{through the early}} 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking {{advantage}} of negative real interest rates, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that government debt rates will continue to stay so low. In January 2012, the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association unanimously recommended that government debt be allowed to auction even lower, at negative absolute interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Proportional systems tend {{to produce}} multiparty {{coalition}} governments. This may reduce salience, if voters perceive {{that they have}} little influence over which parties {{are included in the}} coalition. For instance, after the 2005 German election, the creation of the executive not only expressed the will of the voters of the majority party but also was the result of political deal-making. Although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee,</b> this is lessened as the parties usually state with whom they will favour a coalition after the elections.|$|E
25|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} has improved {{the safety and}} performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems {{that were supposed to}} stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.|$|E
50|$|Carnegie {{based his}} {{philosophy}} on {{the observation that}} the heirs of large fortunes frequently squandered them in riotous living rather than nurturing and growing them. Even bequeathing one's fortune to charity <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{that it would be}} used wisely, {{due to the fact that}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that a charitable organization not under one's direction would use the money in accordance with one's wishes. Carnegie disapproved of charitable giving that maintained the poor in their impoverished state, and urged a movement toward the creation of a new mode of giving that would create opportunities for the beneficiaries of the gift to better themselves. As a result, the gift would not be simply consumed, but would be productive of even greater wealth throughout the house.|$|R

25|$|Once the dog {{can keep}} fluids down, the IV fluids are {{gradually}} discontinued, and very bland food slowly introduced. Oral antibiotics are administered {{for a number}} of days depending on the white blood cell count and the patient's ability to fight off secondary infection. A puppy with minimal symptoms can recover in 2 or 3 days if the IV fluids are begun as soon as symptoms are noticed and the CPV test confirms the diagnosis. If more severe, depending on treatment, puppies can remain ill from 5 days up to 2 weeks. However, even with hospitalization, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the dog will be cured and survive.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Northern Irish and Scottish notes, the UK {{does not}} require the Isle of Man {{government}} to back the Manx currency with Bank of England notes or securities. There is no restriction under UK law on the amount of notes and coins they may issue. The currency is not underwritten by the UK government, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> of payment beyond that given by the Manx authorities. However, the requirement in the island's Currency Act 1992 for the Isle of Man Treasury to exchange Manx Pound banknotes on demand for Bank of England notes in practice restricts the issue of unbacked currency, and the aggregate total of notes issued must be pre-approved by Tynwald.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer {{has some kind of}} fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> that any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E
30|$|In a naive multi-copy strategy, a node {{has no way}} {{of knowing}} whether it can delete a message in case it runs out of memory. As this is a {{distributed}} problem, there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> that all nodes will not delete the same message, making it undeliverable.|$|R
50|$|Disney has {{received}} better terms with Touchwood than with their previous funding partnerships, Silver Screen. The Partnership offers a lower interest than Silver Screens {{due to the}} lower Japanese interest rates in 1990.
