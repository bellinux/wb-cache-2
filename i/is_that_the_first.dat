5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two avatars are depicted with a torso {{of a man and}} the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E

25|$|A central plank in the Marlovian theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> clear {{association}} of William Shakespeare with the works bearing {{his name was}} just thirteen days after Marlowe's supposed death.

25|$|Therefore, a possibility, first {{suggested}} by Francis Crick, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> life {{was based on}} RNA, which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the catalytic properties of some proteins. This is called the RNA world hypothesis, and it {{is supported by the}} observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them. The catalytic properties of RNA had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first proposed, but they were confirmed by Thomas Cech in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{morphological}} similarities {{present in}} embryos of different species during development, {{it was once}} assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that human embryos passed through an amphibian then a reptilian stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a reenactment, often called recapitulation theory, is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms. At very early stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features emerge from this basic pattern.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers {{developed}} a primitive form of trust called ‘the use’ that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land {{for the use of}} another person.

25|$|It {{is known}} from Hammond & Anderson {{that the first}} {{printing}} appeared on March 1, 1938. A library copy of the third printing has been seen with a check-out date of November 28, 1938.

25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as abiogenesis, {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the panspermia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land as a way to gain wood for housing and space for their farming/living areas. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations: one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady from neighboring regions, with incoming groups bearing high genetic similarity to the established ones and integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was not a racial one, but principally a class or caste distinction in which the Tutsi herded cattle while the Hutu farmed the land. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa of Rwanda share a common language and are collectively known as the Banyarwanda.|$|E
25|$|Another {{result of}} this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{constitution}} of an independent Anglican Church in the country bent over backwards to distance itself from Rome by calling itself the Protestant Episcopal Church, incorporating in its name <b>the</b> term, Protestant, <b>that</b> Anglicans elsewhere had shown some care in using too prominently due to their own reservations {{about the nature of}} the Church of England, and other Anglican bodies, vis-à-vis later radical reformers who were happier to use the term Protestant.|$|R

500|$|Noteworthy in the {{development}} of the legend <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> canonically elected Bishop of Turku, a certain Johan (1286–1289) of Polish origin, was elected as the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1289, after three years in office in Turku. The Swedish bishops of Finland [...] before him, Bero, Ragvald and Kettil, had apparently been selected by the King of Sweden. Related to the new situation was also the appointment of the king's brother as the Duke of Finland in 1284, which challenged the Bishop's earlier position as the sole authority on all local matters. Johan was followed in Turku by Bishop Magnus (1291–1308), who had been born in Finland.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} named by ornithologist John Latham in 1790 {{based on a}} {{specimen}} from the Sydney area of Australia, a country which was known as New Holland at the time.

In his original 1816 description of the emu, the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot used two generic names, first Dromiceius and later Dromaius. It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in taxonomy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> name given to an organism stands, unless it is clearly a typographical error. Most modern publications, {{including those of the}} Australian government, use Dromaius, with Dromiceius mentioned as an alternative spelling.|$|E
