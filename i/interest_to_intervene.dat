The poll revealed that a [...] "strong majority" [...] of citizens do not want Congress to authorize a military strike against the Assad government. [...] Over 70% of respondents did not believe that a military strike would achieve US goals, and a similar percentage do not believe it is in the United States' national <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> [...] According to the poll, even if Congress were to authorize military action, 55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes. [...] When asked about a plan that limited military action to 90 days and prohibited the use of ground troops, like S.J.Res 21 would authorize, 59% still opposed it. [...] The poll also indicated that President Obama's approval rating on foreign policy was at its lowest point ever and that only 3 in 10 approved of how he is handling Syria.|$|E

Yet, the polarizing forces in favor of or against agricultural biotechnology in these national debates are largely fueled by stakeholders from Europe and the United States. The author argues that these foreign stakeholders may have a strategic <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in public debates in developing countries with the expectation of gaining public trust back home. National academia, which still enjoys most public trust in developing countries, should counteract this trend in this particular area by reassuming political and scientific leadership in their respective countries.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{millions}} {{have been}} killed in a series of genocides. The dismantlement of the Soviet Union left the United States with new decisions to make regarding human rights violations. The United States government no longer had hard <b>interests</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in cases of human rights violations. I show through a comparative study of the genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Darfur that it takes political pressure for the United States to intervene: it takes multiple calls for action from members of Congress and the American people for the United States to step in and end the violence. I used congressional meeting minutes and hearings to show the political pressure and calls for U. S. intervention. In addition to the media that congressional representatives use in their calls for action, I looked at New York Times and Washington Post articles to show the media attention given to the acts of genocide. To study the response to the genocides, I examined the patterns that emerged in the US response to them. To emphasize the comparisons between the three cases I show how they all follow the same pattern of U. S. intervention, consisting of four phases. The pattern is distinct in all three acts of genocid...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to address the severe paucity in both South African and {{international}} literature concerning eating disordered behaviour in young ballet dancers. Allegations suggest that for decades a conspiratorial silence has been maintained in the dancing world around the eating disordered behaviours of performers. The only serious suggestions alluding to high levels of eating disordered behaviour among performers in South Africa have appeared anecdotally in the popular media. Previous international research has suggested that dancers could not possibly maintain their sylph-like physiques with the amount of energy expended in daily training and simultaneously adhere to healthy nutritional standards. In fact, some studies cite high levels of malnutrition amongst members of the dance community (Peterson, 1984). The current research study confinns these findings showing highly significant differences in the drive for thinness in dancers compared with normative adolescent samples. Results also indicate tendencies to interpersonal distrust which could explain why this sensitive behaviour has been so difficult to identify and treat in the past. More detailed statistical analyses show that this sample of adolescent dancers exhibit strong similarities with eating disordered individuals, both anorexic and bulimic. These results provide the evidence required by <b>interested</b> parties <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in the neglected nutrition and psychological health of dancers. 1...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} how tensions {{between work and}} play for video game developers shape the worlds they create. The worlds of game developers, whose daily activity is linked to larger systems of experimentation and technoscientific practice, provide insights that transcend video game development work. The essay draws on ethnographic material from over 3 years of fieldwork with video game developers in the United States and India. It develops the notion of creative collaborative practice based on {{work in the fields}} of science and technology studies, game studies, and media studies. The importance of, the desire for, or the drive to understand underlying systems and structures has become fundamental to creative collaborative practice. I argue that the daily activity of game development embodies skills fundamental to creative collaborative practice and that these capabilities represent fundamental aspects of critical thought. Simultaneously, numerous <b>interests</b> have begun <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in ways that endanger these foundations of creative collaborative practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on the balancing of public <b>interests</b> that needs <b>to</b> be undertaken under English law when dealing with posthumous medical confidentiality. Until 2007, doctors were bound only by professional codes of ethics to maintain confidentiality after their patients’ death. In 2008, the High Court stated that it is arguable that confidentiality applies in the post-mortem context. This, it claimed, is in the public interest. The court then followed the ecthr in using the same basis – public <b>interest</b> – <b>to</b> accept {{that there may be}} exceptions to this duty. This paper considers different situations where multiple interests come together for and against the posthumous disclosure of medical information. This examination suggests that there is considerable uncertainty caused by using one notion of public <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> justify confidentiality, and another {{to make the case for}} disclosure. It calls for the legislator <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> help resolve the conundrum...|$|R

At the same time, users are often upset when network providers intervene and deem such an intrusion an unjust occurrence. This article analyzes how decisions <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> can be communicated {{in such a way}} that users consider them adequate and acceptable. A first experiment shows that informational justice perceptions of social network users depend on the format in which network providers present the decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> More specifically, if a decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> is presented in the form of a story, as opposed to an analytical rendering of facts and arguments, decisions <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> prompt more positive informational justice perceptions. A second experiment reveals that when users relate the experience to themselves, narrative transportation increases, which positively affects perceptions of the justice of decisions <b>to</b> <b>intervene...</b>|$|R

40|$|What {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for addressing the issue of intervention?] In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of interest in the area of genomic signal processing, which is the engineering discipline that studies the processing of genomic signals. Since regulatory decisions within the cell utilize numerous inputs, analytical tools are necessary to model the multivariate influences on decision-making produced by complex genetic networks. Signal processing approaches such as detection, prediction and classification have been used in the recent past to construct genetic regulatory networks capable of modeling genetic behavior. To accommodate the large amount of uncertainty associated with this kind of modeling, many of the networks proposed are probabilistic. One of the objectives of network modeling is to use the network to design different intervention approaches for affecting the time evolution of the gene activity profile of the network. More specifically, one is <b>interested</b> in <b>intervening</b> <b>to</b> help the network avoid undesirable states such as those associated with a disease...|$|R

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{is considered}} a global public health issue. Most people disapprove of partner-related abuse, yet are disinclined <b>to</b> personally <b>intervene</b> in order <b>to</b> stop the violence. Public interventions are important {{for the prevention of}} IPV, but little is known concerning psychological antecedents of public intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> The aim of this thesis was to explore beliefs concerning IPV (Study I), to examine the psychological predictors of propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> against IPV (Study II), and to experimentally test the causal effect of descriptive social norms on intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> (Study III). Data for the three studies were collected through web-based surveys that were distributed to adults in the Swedish general population. In Study I, respondents estimated on average that IPV exists in 24 % of all Swedish relationships and considered psychological violence to be the most frequent type of abuse. Approximately half of the respondents believed that IPV is equally distributed across demographic groups, while persons with low socio-economic status, non-European immigrants, inhabitants of suburban areas and people in the age range of 35 - 49 were regarded as particularly vulnerable to IPV. Respondents held IPV victims partially responsible for the violence, believing, for example, that victims contribute to the abuse by acting provocatively. Eight out of ten respondents described at least one intervention strategy they would consider using in a real-life scenario, although the reported strategies were mainly limited to talking to the victim and/or the perpetrator. Overall, female respondents displayed a greater awareness of the magnitude of IPV, victims’ vulnerability, and available intervention options compared to male respondents. The findings suggest that the Swedish public needs to be better informed about IPV and specifically regarding available intervention options and victims’ vulnerability to the violence. In Study II, motivational predictors were found to account for the largest proportion of variation in respondents’ propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Thus, feeling morally obligated <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and experiencing negative emotions in relation to IPV may be particularly important for the formation of intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Cognitive predictors accounted for a smaller, yet significant, proportion of the explained variance in propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Considering IPV <b>to</b> be a prevalent problem in society and not attributing solution responsibility only to the offender were associated with stronger intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> In Study III, participants first completed a web-based survey assessing the strength of their personal norms related <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> and a pre-manipulation measure of their propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Two weeks later, participants were randomly assigned to watch one of three short film sequences portraying an outdoor male-to-female physical case of IPV. Descriptive social norms were manipulated so that the film either showed (a) a bystander intervening, (b) a bystander not intervening, or (c) no visible bystander. A second questionnaire assessed a post-manipulation measure of participants’ propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and dispositional self-monitoring (i. e., inclination to adjust their behavior to perceived social demands). As predicted, participants exposed to a non-intervention social norm reported a decreased propensity <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Thus, intervention rates may be reduced by social norms signaling that people do not intervene against IPV. Moreover, personal norms and self-monitoring appeared to reliably promote intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> The current thesis contributes to the existing IPV literature, which lacks a clear picture with regard to common beliefs concerning IPV and factors that may inhibit or promote people’s intentions <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> Such knowledge is essential for the design of intervention programs aiming at improving public intervention rates...|$|R
