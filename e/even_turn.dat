5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E

25|$|Each kohen's tallit is {{draped over}} his head and hands so that the {{congregation}} cannot see his hands while the blessing is said. Performing the Jewish ceremony of the priestly blessing is known in Yiddish as duchening, a reference to the bimah on which the blessing is said. The tradition of covering the hands stems from the biblical prohibition against a Kohen with hands that are disfigured in any way from offering the blessing. The rabbis softened this prohibition by saying that a Kohen with disfigured hands to which the community had become accustomed could bless. In later centuries, the practice became for all Kohanim to cover their hands so that any disfigurement would not be seen by the Congregation. This gave rise to folklore that one should not see the hands of the Kohen or even that harm would befall someone who sees the hands of the Kohen. Some congregants will <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> their backs to the Kohanim so as to avoid any possibility of seeing their hands—although this practice is unsupported by any rabbinic source.|$|E

For example, the straight {{distance from the}} [...] to the [...] is only , but the path itself is a much longer [...] The passages are also steep and narrow, further inhibiting entry. This system allowed the intruders to be watched and fired upon from the keep during their lengthy approach, but Himeji Castle was never attacked in this manner so the system remains untested. However, even today with the route clearly marked, many visitors have trouble navigating the castle complex.|$|E

After the brawl, police handcuffed Chris and his cousin, but freed their friend, telling him to [...] "run, don't walk" [...] and to [...] "not <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> around". When Chris was booked, police reported that they initiated a high-speed chase and were following his car. Chris Perez reported that the officers were lying, but decided not to pursue the matter because it would be [...] " [...] word against theirs." [...] He was released without charges, but told Selena and Abraham about his run-in with the police. They appreciated being informed and this helped gain their trust.|$|E
2500|$|Sufis {{believe the}} sharia (exoteric [...] "canon"), tariqa (esoteric [...] "order") and haqiqa ("truth") are {{mutually}} interdependent. Sufism leads the adept, called salik or [...] "wayfarer", in his sulûk or [...] "road" [...] through different stations (maqaam) until he reaches his goal, the perfect tawhid, the existential confession that God is One. Ibn Arabi says, [...] "When we see someone in this Community {{who claims to}} be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved.

2500|$|Following Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union became formal Allies, providing further impetus for an Allied invasion. With the German Army steadily advancing through the Soviet Union, the Persian Corridor formed by the Trans-Iranian Railway {{was one of the}} easiest ways for the Allies to get Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviets, sent by sea from the United States. British and Soviet planners recognised the importance of that railway and sought to control it. As increasing U-boat attacks and winter ice made convoys to Arkhangelsk dangerous, the railway became an increasingly attractive route. The Soviets wanted to make Iranian Azerbaijan and the Turkmen Sahra part of the Soviet Union or <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> Iran into a communist state. The two Allied nations applied pressure on Iran and the Shah, which led only to increased tensions and anti-British rallies in Tehran. The British described the protests as being [...] "pro-German". Iran's strategic position threatened Soviet Caucasian oil and their armies' rear and a German advance would threaten British communications between India and the Mediterranean.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{construction}} stalled, {{other aspects}} of the convention center project moved ahead. In mid-September, the Fine Arts Advisory Committee approved the landscape redesign of Mall B, the new reception pavilion, the [...] long reflecting pool, and 10 fountains for the mall. Anemometers would be placed on the mall to monitor wind speed, and a computer would automatically lower the water level (or <b>even</b> <b>turn</b> off the fountains) during periods of high wind so that people nearby would not be doused with spray. The fountains would be heated in winter to prevent freezing, and colored lights would be used to illuminate the steam coming of the warm water. In addition, the maintenance trust established by the Hanna Fund agreed to place lights under all the trees on the mall, pay for lit and decorated cut Christmas trees to be put on the mall each December, and to constantly renew and replace the plantings during the nine-month growing season. For the reception pavilion, the Fine Arts Committee approved an exterior of dark-coated aluminum and light grey granite, with the long side of the structure a glass curtain wall. With the pavilion's design approved, the city anticipated issuing construction bids for the $9.3 million ($ in [...] dollars) structure in October.|$|E
