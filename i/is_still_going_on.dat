25|$|Radiation {{exposure}} from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays {{into other}} solid particulate radium-series radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain {{lodged in the}} lungs, causing continued exposure. Radon is thus assumed to be the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths {{per year in the}} US alone.. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the rising of the Himalayas <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.|$|E

25|$|The bombings {{also caused}} a major rift within the D-Company, the most {{powerful}} criminal organisation in the Mumbai underworld, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation, taking most of the leadership-level Hindu aides such as Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan with him. Rajan's split divided the Mumbai underworld along communal lines and pitted Chotta Rajan's predominantly Hindu gang against Dawood Ibrahim's predominantly Muslim D-Company. The ensuing gang war took the lives {{of more than a}} hundred gangsters and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in 2017.

25|$|The {{success of}} the series had {{received}} attention of Fargo advertising agency H2M, who, in 2006, created its own “Talking Orange”, which is the spokesman for an ad campaign for the North Dakota Department of Transportation. Both of the two characters were two anthropomorphic oranges with ties to the Fargo-Moorhead area. Despite only slightly resembling the “Talking Orange”, the Annoying Orange was looked into by H2M’s attorneys as an intellectual property matter. Boedigheimer stated he had not watched the “Talking Orange” videos before he was told about the disagreement, also believing that the characters weren’t very similar. Boedigheimer and Grove were later sued by H2M in May 2013 for allegedly copying the character. No source has been released stating whether the case has been disclosed or <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{cards are}} read in round, {{it is common}} for an {{opponent}} to collect and examine even while a speech <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.|$|E

They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E

We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E

It exhibits mostly strombolian activity; the most recent eruption, which started in 1934, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's roughly 500,000-year history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. [...] Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north.

[...] He contrasted the approach in Queensland with the practices developed in NSW during after the 1955 Hunter Valley floods, that aimed to move homes out of dangerous areas and establish warning systems. Keys also stated the NSW practices were being undone by reduced funding and unsafe housing developments, giving the example of Maitland where [...] "the council now wants to build hundreds of dwellings on the flood plain in and round the CBD". Keys also expressed concern over deforestation, stating that, [...] "What we need is re-forestation." ...|$|E
