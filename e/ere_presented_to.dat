40|$|Many {{naturally}} occurring and man-made chemicals {{present in the}} environment possess estrogenic activity. Examples include plant and fungal products, pesticides, plasticizers, and other agricultural and industrial chemicals. These environmental estrogens as well as endogenous ovarian estrogens are thought to initiate their physiological actions in target tissues largely via interactions with a nuclear receptor system. The resultant estrogen-receptor complex in turn affects transcription via its interactions with nucleotide sequences known as estrogen response elements (<b>EREs)</b> <b>present</b> in the regulatory regions of hormone responsive genes. A "consensus" ERE sequence GGTCAnnnTGACC was originally identified in the vitellogenin genes of birds and amphibians, but {{it is now clear}} that most {{naturally occurring}} EREs differ from this sequence in one or more bases. We and others have obtained both in vivo and in vitro data suggesting a differential interaction of receptor complexes containing different ligands with the multiple <b>EREs</b> <b>present</b> in mammalian systems. This raises the possibility that the toxicity of environmental estrogens may arise in part from a differential pattern of ERE activation by environmental compounds relative to endogenous ovarian estrogens. The experimental basis for such a paradigm and its toxicological implications are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The estrogen-responsive element (<b>ERE)</b> <b>present</b> in the 5 '-flanking {{region of}} the Xenopus laevis {{vitellogenin}} (vit) gene B 1 has been characterized by transient expression analysis of chimeric vit-tk-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene constructs transfected into the human estrogen-responsive MCF- 7 cell line. The vit B 1 ERE behaves like an inducible enhancer, since {{it is able to}} confer estrogen inducibility to the heterologous HSV thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in a relative position- and orientation-independent manner. In this assay, the minimal B 1 ERE is 33 bp long and consists of two 13 bp imperfect palindromic elements both of which are required for the enhancer activity. A third imperfect palindromic element is present further upstream within the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} gene but is unable to confer hormone responsiveness by itself. Similarly, neither element forming the B 1 ERE can alone confer estrogen inducibility to the tk promoter. However, in combinations of two, all three imperfect palindromes can act cooperatively to form a functional ERE. In contrast a single 13 bp perfect palindromic element, GGTCACTGTGACC, such as the one found upstream of the vit gene A 2, is itself sufficient to act as a fully active ERE. Single point mutations within this element abolish estrogen inducibility, while a defined combination of two mutations converts this ERE into a glucocorticoid-responsive element...|$|R

40|$|Extended Red Emission (ERE) {{has been}} {{detected}} in many dusty astrophysical objects and {{this raises the}} question: Is <b>ERE</b> <b>present</b> only in discrete objects or is it an observational feature of all dust, i. e. present in the diffuse interstellar medium? In order to answer this question, we determined the blue and red intensities of the radiation from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and examined the red intensity {{for the presence of}} an excess above that expected for scattered light. The diffuse ISM blue and red intensities were obtained by subtracting the integrated star and galaxy intensities from the blue and red measurements made by the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) aboard the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The color of the diffuse ISM was found to be redder than the Pioneer intensities, contrary to that expected for scattered light (Diffuse Galactic Light [DGL]). The red DGL was calculated using the blue diffuse ISM intensities and the approximately invariant color of the DGL calculated with the DGL model. Subtracting the calculated red DGL from the red diffuse ISM intensities resulted in the detection of an excess red intensity. This represents the likely detection of ERE in the diffuse ISM since H-alpha emission cannot account for the strength of this excess and the only other known emission process applicable to the diffuse ISM is ERE. Thus, ERE appears to be a general characteristic of dust. From the correlation between N_HI and ERE intensity the ERE photon conversion efficiency was estimated at 10 +/- 3 %.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that COUP-TFII and Ear- 2, {{two members of}} the nuclear orphan receptor family, are able to repress oestrogen-stimulated transcriptional activity of the human oxytocin (OT) gene promoter by binding to a site that overlaps with the oestrogen response element (<b>ERE)</b> <b>present</b> in the 5 * flanking region of the gene. Although most nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional repres-sion conforms with the paradigm of passive repression and involves competitive binding to an activator site, active repression, i. e. silencing of basal promoter activity, has been observed in a limited number of cases. Here we show by co-transfection experiments using COUP-TFII and Ear- 2 expression vectors and reporter constructs containing OT gene promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene that both COUP-TFII and Ear- 2 are capable of silencing basal OT gene promoter activity by 54 and 75 % respectively. 5 * Deletion and footprint analyses revealed two areas of functionally important interaction sites: (1) a direct TGACC(T/C) repeat overlapping the ERE and (2) a more promoter-proximal area centred at " 90 containing three imperfect direct repeats (R 1 –R 3) spaced by four nucleotides each. Mutagenesis of reporter con-structs as well as electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated that each of the three proximal repeats R 1 –R 3 contributed to orphan receptor binding and the silencing eVect. Inasmuch as the orphan receptor-binding sites are not involved in mediating basal transcriptional activity of the OT gene promoter, the observed eVects are best interpreted as active repression or promoter silenc-ing. Moreover, since COUP-TFII and Ear- 2 are both co-expressed in OT-expressing uterine epithe-lial cells, the novel transcriptional eVects described here are likely to be of functional importance in the fine-tuning of uterine OT gene expression in vivo...|$|R
