40|$|The {{ability of}} a company to {{generate}} sustainable operating cash flow and free cash flow is an important indicator of the company's financial health. Current treatment of income taxes paid calls for their inclusion in operating cash flow. However, some of these taxes are related to gains on investing or <b>financing</b> <b>items.</b> Their inclusion in operations can cause operating cash flow to be understated. In this study, we examine 2004 and 2005 financial statements to identify a sample of companies where the effects of taxes on non-operating gains have a material effect on operating cash flow. We found cases where operating cash flow was understated by a significant amount. In one case, {{the removal of the}} taxes paid on non-operating gains caused an increase of operating cash flow by nearly forty-five percent. A supplemental table looks at the effects of such taxes on free cash flow with similar findings...|$|E

40|$|An individual’s {{attitude}} toward financial risk tolerance (FRT) {{is an important}} preference that influences financial decision-making under uncertainty. FRT involves inter-temporal resource allocation. Accurate and reliable measures of FRT are essential for professionals advising consumers as well as researchers {{who are trying to}} predict, and understand consumer behavior. This study explores cross-cultural risk tolerance by comparing random samples from Turkey, and the United States. Similar and distinctive attitudes and patterns regarding FRT are identified. Three subjective measures of FRT are employed in this study: Grable and Lytton (1999), Hanna, Gutter and Fan’s (2001) improved version of Barsky, Juster, Kimball and Shapiro (1997), and the Survey of Consumer <b>Finance’s</b> <b>item</b> on risk tolerance. Data was collected via an online survey that used the above-mentioned FRT measures. There were two versions: the original American English version, and a culturally translated Turkish version. To explore the correlation of FRT among measures, we use bivariate analysis by individually employing Pearson Chi-square test of independence, and cross tabulations analysis to each sample. In addition, by pooling both samples, we conduct cumulative logistic regression. We delineate FRT differences and consistencies between countries across subjective financial risk tolerance measures...|$|R

In a special limiting case with demographics that make Ricardian equivalence prevail, the 1800 s rule does nothing to promote efficiency. But when the demographics imply even a moderate departure from Ricardian equivalence, imposing the rule substantially improves the efficiency of democratically chosen allocations.

5000|$|Items {{traded in}} an {{economic}} bubble {{are much more likely}} to have an intrinsic value that is worth a substantial proportion of the market price. Therefore, following collapse of an economic bubble (especially one in a commodity such as real estate) the items affected will often retain some value, whereas an investment that is part of a Ponzi scheme will typically be worthless (or very close to worthless). On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain <b>financing</b> for many <b>items</b> that are the frequent subject of bubbles. If an investor trading on margin or borrowing to finance investments becomes the victim of a bubble, he or she can still lose all (or a very substantial portion) of his or her investment capital, or even be liable for losses in excess of the original capital investment.|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{rigorous}} psychometric methodology {{was used}} to develop a measure of unmet needs for cancer survivors' principal support persons. Principal support person was defined as "someone {{you can count on}} and who helps you with your needs. " Methods: Development of the domains and the items followed an extensive literature review, iterative input from support persons, and consultation with health professionals and front-line staff working with cancer survivors and their supports. Cognitive interviews helped clarify item wording, and the draft questionnaire was reappraised by a group of support persons. The questionnaire was reduced to 90 items and sent to a stratified, random sample of cancer survivors selected from a provincial population-based cancer registry. They were asked to give the survey to their support person. Results: The resulting 78 -item Support Person Unmet Needs Survey has high acceptability, item test-retest reliability, internal consistency (Chronbach alpha =. 990), and face, content, and construct validity.

The master plan examined the whole building through its history, giving consideration to the range of period styles various rooms had undergone over time. Much of the initial work was towards negating the results of a 1970 renovation that paid little attention to historic scholarship. As the plan emerged, a complex schedule based on the building's heavy use during the legislative session needed to be negotiated. Over the course of twenty years, a dramatic transformation has occurred. The two main legislative chambers have been restored to their 1859 appearance. Period furniture upholstered in a vinyl product in the 1970s were restored using authentic silk satin, silk velvet, and horsehair fabrics. Complex period carpeting was rewoven and installed, chandeliers and sconces were restored, and new drapery based on old photographs were recreated and hung.

The next stage, a content analysis of the focus groups, enabled the construction of a questionnaire containing over 100 items on various aspects of quality of life (QoL). The questionnaire was reviewed by a panel of experts and the items were refined and reduced to 86 to which were added a further 25 items for socio-demographic background. This formed the initial instrument. The final stage was a validation study based on a representative community survey, with a sample of 3, 000 respondents drawn for the research team by the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. The survey yielded 1, 616 successful interviews with older persons aged 60 or above. The careful stratification of the sample enabled us to say that subjects in all the stages of the survey had broadly similar characteristics to the general Hong Kong elderly population in sex and age distribution. After a rigorous process of validation, the research team recommended the adoption of both an index and six domains for measuring Hong Kong older persons 2 ̆ 7 QoL.

Taking into account fast changes in the social sphere of the country and regular increase of social standards, the article identifies a necessity of changing priorities of the social policy, first of all, problems of financing the social sphere and formation of priority directions on improvement of this system.

The article offers to use the hierarchy analysis method for identifying immediate and priority directions of financing components of the social sphere. On the basis of the built directed communication graph the article presents a binary matrix of dependence of components of the social sphere and builds a hierarchy model of these components. As a result it is seen that the highest level of hierarchy is taken by science, then healthcare and social sphere are at the same level, then education, sports and at the lowest level are culture and art. The obtained results could be used when improving financing of the social sphere. In order to ensure efficiency of functioning of the social sphere it is necessary to improve the system of financing of its components on the basis of use of the hierarchy model. Moreover, building the model of hierarchy composition of priorities of the social sphere with consideration of experience of the leading world countries requires further study...|$|R
