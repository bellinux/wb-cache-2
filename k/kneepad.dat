Shin guards help protect the knee joint and the frontal bones of the leg from pucks, sticks, skates, falls and other impacts. However, it is essential to buy proper shin guards. If the shin guard is too long it will slip down into the skate and prevent proper movement of the ankle; if the shin guard does not fit perfectly at the knee joint, then the patella will not be properly protected and lead to injury. There is a size scale for shin guards which most sports stores have available and which one can utilize to assess the right size.|$|E

The model developed allowed the simulation by the performance of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of different angles and different forces. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the result of kneeling 60 degree, kneeling 90 degree, and squatting to the knee joint with and without <b>kneepad.</b> However, this study is focused for construction worker such as mining worker. This study was simulated by using Autodesk Simulation Multiphysics to solve the finite element analysis. There are several crucial points to the proper application of numerical method such as the geometry, material properties, and boundary condition must be created to solve the finite element analysis that must have in finite element method. The force applied is at the area patella with the value of 303 N, 603 N, and 903 N. The femur bone, tibia bone, and patella are assumed as rigid body. From the result the effect of kneeling 90 degree, kneeling 120 degree flexion, and squatting to the patella., the maximum stress on patella of 90 degree flexion is higher because have larger contact surface area as the knee was bent than 60 degree flexion and 120 degree flexion. For stress vs. deformation for cartilage, the position of 90 degree flexion give the higher stress and deformation as the stress on patella was high the stress to the cartilage became higher the contact stress of patella occur at the superior half of the patella and an area of the femoral groove just above the notch that means the contact stress of patella to cartilage 90 degree flexion was larger than 60 degree and 120 degree flexion. As for ligaments, at 90 degree flexion,the higher stress occur at ACL for without and with <b>kneepad</b> with the value 0. 507 MPa and 0. 0667 MPa with the percentage of absorption to the <b>kneepad</b> is 86 %, followed by PCL 98. 5 %. MCL is 99. 4 %, and LCL 98. 5 %. From the result, it is true that the most common ligament injuries in mining or construction worker is ACL tear as the results shows that ACL gives highest stress that other ligaments. PCL had lower stress than ACL as in medical, PCL gives far less common injury than ACL because of PCL function itself that maintaining joint normal function. From the research, it can be concluded that wearing the <b>kneepad</b> will reduce the stress on knee ligament of construction worker to prevent injury and knee pain...|$|E

The authors analyzed data froma 3 -year (1996 – 1999), stratified, two-stage cluster sample of athletes from 12 organized sports in 100 North Carolina high schools (n 19, 728 athlete-seasons). Information on each athlete’s use of protective equipment and prior injury was collected during the preseason.

Use of lower extremity discretionary protective equipment tended to decrease the overall rate of lower extremity injury (rate ratio (RR) 0. 91, 95 %confidence interval (CI) : 0. 72, 1. 15). However, this slight protective effect was entirely due to <b>kneepad</b> use (for knee injury, RR 0. 44, 95 % CI: 0. 27, 0. 74).

In this work we address such multifaceted challenge {{with the development}} of smart garments for lower limb motion detection, like a textile <b>kneepad</b> and anklet in which soft sensors and readout electronics are embedded for retrieving movement of the specific joint. Stretchable capacitive sensors with a three-electrode configuration are built combining conductive textiles and elastomeric layers, and distributed around knee and ankle. Results show an excellent behavior in the ~ 30 % strain range, hence the correlation between sensors’ responses and the optically tracked Euler angles is allowed for basic lower limb movements. Bending during knee flexion/extension is detected, and it is discriminated from any external contact by implementing in real time a low computational algorithm. The smart anklet is designed to address joint motion detection in and off the sagittal plane. Ankle dorsi/plantar flexion, adduction/abduction, and rotation are retrieved. Both knee and ankle smart garments show a high accuracy in movement detection, with a RMSE less than 4 ° in the worst case...|$|E
40|$|Background Knee {{injuries}} play a {{large part}} of musculoskeletal traumas in sporting activities and the rehabilitation can require a long period, for both the patients and the specialists, to restore healthy condition. A reliable, portable and low cost system that could allow quick, simple and effective measures of knee flexion angles, would greatly improve the evaluation of the rehabilitation process and the subsequent planning procedure, with meaningful reduction of the recovery time and cost. Methods It is proposed a novel tool for the non-stop measurements of the knee flexion angles, based on the adoption of an elastic sensor embedded in an easy-to-realize wearable <b>kneepad.</b> We fully characterized this tool in terms of accuracy, repeatability and reliability of the measure, and validated it against the gold-standard Vicon. Results Our tool demonstrated good reproducibility and repeatability among testers (mean Range of measures = 5. 82 ° ± 1. 93 °) and high accuracy (root mean square error < 1. 28 °), together with a good reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient between 0. 80 and 0. 91). Conclusions The proposed tool demonstrates good performances, is portable, cheap, easy to use, and allows automatic measurements, so to be a valuable system for accurate non-stop measurement of knee angles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a long debate among {{researchers}} on whether soccer heading is capable of causing brain trauma. A recent study suggests that headings exceeding a threshold level of 855 to 1, 550 per year, results in microstructural abnormalities in the brain's white matter. This shows that brain trauma is caused by cumulative effect of repetitive headings. The use of protective headgear is one of the suggested preventive measures to protect the brain especially for younger players. Researchers have tested several commercial headgears and found that they are only effective in head-to-head impact, but ineffective in attenuating impact caused by heading. This {{is due to the fact}} that soccer ball is compliant in nature relative to the head. The aim of this study is to investigate materials that can be utilised to minimise the acceleration of the brain caused by soccer heading. A vertical drop ball test was conducted on an instrumented dummy skull. The inner cavity of the skull is filled with ultrasound gel that represents the brain. Six impact-absorbing materials were tested to determine the most effective material that reduces the acceleration of the brain substitute. The speed of the ball before and after impact as well as impact duration were measured using high-speed camera. Coefficient of restitution was calculated to ensure the material is not only capable of reducing the brain acceleration, but also maintains heading performance.

40|$|Many {{challenges}} are faced by workers in lower-seam (42 inches or less) mines. The lower-seam heights confine mine workers {{to their knees}} as they perform their daily tasks such as installing roof bolts, delivering supplies, repairing belt, or cutting coal. Miners working in these lower seams often consider <b>kneepads</b> to be their only {{line of defense against}} knee injuries. However, healthy knees do not start and stop with <b>kneepads.</b> Other interventions such as changing postures, proper hygiene, and work station design may also be used to reduce mine workers risks for developing knee injuries. Incorporating these and many other interventions into a mine worker s way of life is an important step to ensuring a long, healthy career and retirement. Keeping knees healthy is also a key aspect to reducing costs in low-seam mines as the industry battles rising health care costs, and training/recruitment of replacement workers is time-consuming and costly. Educating the workforce about the possible interventions to reduce knee injury risk is a primary objective for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health s (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL). Therefore, NIOSH researchers, along with industry and academia, developed a training package to educate the mining com munity about some possible interventions beyond <b>kneepads</b> that may be used to help decrease knee injury rates.

40|$|Ligament {{is tough}} bands of fibrous tissues that connect between two bones. Those bones are the tibia and femur bones. The knee {{structure}} is including the femur (thighbone), tibia (shinbone), ligament, meniscus, articular cartilage, tendon and patella (kneecap). The {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) connects the femur to the tibia {{at the center of}} the knee. It limits rotation and the forward motion of the tibia. The ACL injury was found to be the highest among others ligament. Running and kicking is the activities that frequently can cause the ACL injury. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element model of the human ACL was developed and the simulation of passive knee flexion was performed. The objective for this study is to investigate the behaviour of the ACL effect when using knee pad during the kicking activities in soccer game. The numerical modeling of passive knee flexion was performed, with and without applying the stress on the ACL. The analysis will consist of analysis with the <b>kneepad</b> and analysis the knee without the knee pad. Both of the analysis involved in knee posturer angles. The angles are 0 ⁰, 45 ⁰, 90 ⁰ and 155 ⁰ of knee flexion. The results show that 90 ⁰ flexion give highest stress value among other knee flexion.

40|$|The 2007 United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{database}} reported 217 knee {{injuries in}} underground coal. From workers ’ compensation data, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{determined that the}} average cost per knee injury in this industry was $ 13, 121. 29 yielding nearly three million dollars as an estimated financial burden of these injuries on the industry in 2007. (1) Recently, NIOSH has investigated various types of interventions that underground coal mining companies may implement as means of decreasing mine workers ’ risk for developing knee injuries. To encourage mining companies to implement this training program and interventions currently in development, NIOSH performed an analysis of workers ’ compensation data for one underground coal mine in Illinois and six in Pennsylvania. The data were for the 2004, 2005, and 2006 claim years of each mine and included medical and indemnity costs for injuries to each body part, the number of injuries per body part, and the annual audited payroll. The rating formulas for the respective states were utilized to determine workers ’ compensation premiums for 2008 which require injury data from 2004 to 2006. For each mine, the costs of workers ’ compensation premiums were determined with all the injuries reported. A second analysis was then performed whereby all knee injuries were excluded. By eliminating knee injuries, the annual workers ’ compensation premiums decreased by 1. 1 % to 16. 2 % depending on the mine’s size and injury statistics. The savings that were observed ranged from $ 4, 206, a 1. 3 % savings, to $ 1, 454, 767, a 6. 4 % savings. The cost of implementing the NIOSH recommended interventions is minimal; therefore, an overall savings for the mine would be expected. Moreover, NIOSH is continuing to develop other interventions {{to reduce the risk}} of knee injury as well such as a novel <b>kneepad</b> designed specifically for the low-seam mining environment. ...|$|E

Nowadays, athletes are facing to the vascular injuries that attack to knee joint. The vascular injuries most commonly affect the popliteal artery followed by the common femoral artery through knee joint. The objective of this project is to develop the three dimensional modeling of the knee and investigate the blood flow through human leg. The researcher has been done simulate the model from Fluid Structure Interfaces (FSI) software for blood flow through human leg. In this setup, the values of blood velocity for different gender male and female at range 20 - 30 years old are been analysis. The different blood velocity during exercise, running and cycling give different result with different gender. Next, normal blood pressure for male and female at 120 mmhg are applied and results were shown the pressure of human after 60 seconds. Besides, variations force are applied to knee joint such as from 250 N, 500 N, 750 N and 1000 N {{in order to get the}} result of displacement and stresses on knee joint after impact. Human legs were considering with and without kneepads for analysis the stresses on knee after impact. By using different materials of kneepads such as PVC, ABS, polycarbonate, coconut fiber, oil palm trunk fiber and kenaf fiber the effects of absorption stresses will notice. In three design of artery through knee joint, the 2 nd design gives the highest velocity for three conditions during exercise, running and cycling. The blood velocity after 60 seconds during exercise is 75. 3 cm/s and 73. 3 cm/s, running is 90. 1 cm/s and 87. 8 cm/s, cycling is 85. 1 cm/s and 84. 8 cm/s for male and female respectively. Six materials of kneepads are simulated and the kenaf fiber is the most suitable <b>kneepad</b> to protect knee. The stress exerted on kenaf fiber of kneepads is 7. 94 MPa at 1000 N for thickness 0. 5 cm. After that, the researcher have been applied the kenaf fiber as kneepads for three condition human leg at same angle but different blood flow pattern. The result represent, for 3 rd condition human leg give the peak velocity blood flow is 77. 13 cm/s and 98. 5 cm/s for with and without kneepads. The 3 rd condition gives the lowest change rate of displacement, thus the value with and without kneepads are 0. 5113 mm and 11. 81 mm respectively. In three models of artery with knee joints give three different values of velocity and pressure. Thus, can be prove that, artery for all human are different and doesn’t give the same blood flow velocity through artery. Besides, for three condition of leg shows the different pattern blood flow in human leg for straight, with bones and artery condition...|$|E
