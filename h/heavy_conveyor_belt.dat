40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during crossing a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete packages on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scale which can be created so as to adjust the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. <b>Conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> and the product in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type designed under the consideration on the dynamics of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales. The experimental results on <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed here is effective enough to practical applications. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> sushi {{was invented}} by Yoshiaki Shiraishi (1914-2001), who had {{problems}} staffing his small sushi restaurant and had difficulties managing the restaurant by himself. He got {{the idea of a}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> sushi after watching beer bottles on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> in an Asahi brewery. After five years of development, including the design of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> and the speed of operations, Shiraishi opened the first <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> sushi Mawaru Genroku Sushi in Higashiosaka in 1958, eventually expanding to up to 250 restaurants all over Japan. However, by 2001, his company had just 11 restaurants. Shiraishi also invented a robotic sushi, served by robots, but this idea has not had commercial success.|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} a clear impact of aerosol {{particles}} on the radiation balance, whether and how aerosol particles influence precipitation is controversial. Here we use the ECHAM 6 -HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i. e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> have been identified separately in 10 -year ECHAM 6 -HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are strongly polluted (i. e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. However, all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes transported on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. <b>Belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> the lower-tropospheric airflow poleward of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson’s analysis of the eastern U. S. cyclone of 5 December 1977, depict the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> moving westward, reaching the northwest quadrant of the storm, turning abruptly anticyclonically, rising to jet level, and departing the cyclone downstream (hereafter, the anticyclonic path). Other studies depict the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> reaching the northwest quadrant, turning cyclonically around the low center, and remaining in the lower troposphere (the cyclonic path). To clarify the path of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> the present study reexamines Carlson’s analysis of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> using an observational and mesoscale numerical modeling study of the 5 December 1977 cyclone. This reexamination raises several previously unappreciated and underappreciated issues.

An upper <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> (2) is placed at a preset distance from the lower belt. The upper belt is provided with multiple transverse ribs (3) that are moved in the transport direction along with the ribs. The ribs are placed on the upper belt such that the ribs cover the lower belt to form individual compartments (4), which are separated from each other to receive and transport the materials. The compartments are closed completely by {{the configuration of the}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> and the ribs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a conveying method for transporting materials. USE - Conveying system for transporting a light bulk material e. g. tobacco leaf or spice, to a processing and refining machine via a chute, a vibration channel or a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> Can also be used for a plastic material granulate, a mineral or an ore.
