50|$|Winchester {{manufactured}} several popular {{small arms}} designed by John M. Browning. For {{decades in the}} late 19th Century-early 20th Century, Browning designs and Winchester firearms were synonymous and the collaboration was highly successful. This {{came to an end}} when Browning proposed a new long recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun design, a prototype finished in 1898, to Winchester management, which ultimately became the Browning Auto-5 shotgun. As was the custom of the time, Browning's earlier designs had been licensed exclusively to Winchester (and other manufacturers) for a single fee payment. With this new product, Browning introduced in his negotiations a continuous royalty fee based upon unit sales, rather than a single <b>front-end</b> <b>fee</b> payment. If the new shotgun became highly successful, Browning stood to make substantially more fee income over the prior license fee arrangements. Winchester management was displeased with the bold change in their relationship, and rejected Browning's offer. Remington Arms was also approached, however the president of Remington {{died of a heart attack}} as Browning waited to offer them the gun. This forced Browning to look overseas to produce the shotgun. However; Remington would later produce a copy of the Auto-5 as the Model 11 which was used by the US Military and was also sold to the civilian market.|$|E

40|$|Since early 1984, note {{issuance}} facilities (NIFs) have {{in considerable}} degree replaced syndicated Eurocurrency bank credits in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers have found it cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing Euronotes. Factors behind this include an increasing awareness of borrowing possibilities, more freedom for Japanese investors to buy foreign securities, {{a drop in the}} relative popularity of bank obligations with investors, and banks' desire to slow asset growth to improve capital ratios.; Measurement of the cost savings to borrowers on NIFs as compared with Eurocredits is difficult because of limited comparison possibilities. Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through issuance of notes, and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced Eurocredits recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper.

40|$|The United States Copyright Office {{performs}} {{a variety of}} functions crucial to the copyright system. Through its core registration and recordation functions, it provides critical information about the authorship, ownership, and copyright status of millions of works of authorship created over the last century; it also advises Congress, other federal agencies, and the courts on copyright law; conducts studies on various aspects of copyright law; participates in international meetings; produces educational programs and publications; and engages in many other activities relating to the administration of copyright law. However, the Copyright Office is seriously underfunded, compromising all of its functions. The essentially flat, <b>front-end</b> <b>fees</b> that the Office charges for registration and recordation fail to generate nearly enough revenue for the Office to survive, let alone thrive. Because the Office depends on Congress to appropriate taxpayer dollars to fund {{over a third of}} a tight budget, and depends on its parent agency, the Library of Congress, to request those appropriations, it is chronically short of funds. In this article, I argue that the Copyright Office should follow the example of the Patent and Trademark Office, and charge significantly differentiated fees for registration and recordation. Just as patent and trademark fees are, those fees should be differentiated across time – over the life of a copyright – by splitting payment up into “front-end” fees imposed at the time of application, and “back-end” fees charged for renewal. They should also be differentiated across different works and applicants at the same time. In addition, I argue that the Copyright Office should be able to set fees based, not just on current costs of services rendered, but also on anticipated capital improvement costs, and on the cost of non-service activities that support the copyright system, such as the preparation of reports on copyright issues and the provision of public information about copyright law. Whether differentiated copyright fees can provide ample funds for an entirely self-supporting Copyright Office is an open question, and it will need to remain open for some time. “Back-end” renewal fees would and should probably only be imposed on new registrations, with the result that back-end revenue would not start flowing until those fees came due on new registrations. Although it would thus take years to fully implement differentiated fees, such fees would eventually produce a wide variety of benefits. They would enable the Copyright Office to better fulfill all of its missions; they would make registration and recordation more affordable for modest applicants and works, thus enlarging the stock of copyright information provided by the Copyright Office; and they would decrease or eliminate reliance on taxpayer support of the Office...|$|R
