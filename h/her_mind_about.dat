25|$|In 2013, Representative Callegari {{supported}} {{the ban on}} abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said {{could lead to the}} closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Callegari did not vote on two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could change <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Callegari 41 percent favorable in 2013, 72 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 9 percent in 2005.|$|E

While defending the Majority Text (also called the Byzantine text-type), and claiming that the Textus Receptus is inferior to the Majority Text, he noted (p. 114) that the NKJV references significant discrepancies among text types in its marginal notes: [...] "None of the three textual traditions on every page of the New Testament ... is labeled 'best' or 'most reliable.'

5000|$|In 2001 Dutch celebrity Sylvia Millecam died as {{a result}} of breast cancer. She had refused {{conventional}} medical treatment, opting for alternative medicine instead. After her death the public prosecutor pressed charges against two alternative health care providers and the self-proclaimed [...] "healing medium" [...] Jomanda. The prosecutor dropped these charges after concluding that Millecam had made up <b>her</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> treatment. At this point the Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij together with Stichting Skepsis took legal steps forcing the prosecutor to continue his case. This resulted in a 2009 verdict against the two alternative health care providers, but acquittal for Jomanda.|$|R
500|$|Cross {{acknowledged}} that [...] "The Rings of Akhaten" [...] {{had received a}} mixed reception and was originally bothered {{by some of the}} criticisms.

One girl told him it had changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> suicide.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{returned}} to Wierzchownia in October, and immediately fell ill with heart issues. His condition deteriorated throughout 1849, and doubts persisted in <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> their union. Biographers generally agree that Hańska was convinced by Balzac's frail state and endless devotion. One wrote: [...] "It was charity, {{as much as}} love or fame, which finally turned the scale." [...] Robb indicates that the wedding was [...] "surely an act of compassion on her part". To avoid rumors and suspicion from the Tsar, Hańska transferred ownership of the estate to her daughter. On 14 March 1850 they traveled to Berdychiv and, accompanied by Anna and Jerzy, were married in a small ceremony at the parish church of St. Barbara.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} {{he goes to}} the play himself and sees his lover at a play called First Love; for him this is a sign, like a four leaf clover, that she must be the one. But {{confusion}} sets in for the poor girl because of mistaken identity. She is unable to make up <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> love and says, [...] "The first love is the true love, and one loves only once." [...] But Kierkegaard says this is sophistry [...] "because the category first, {{is at the same time}} a qualitative and a numerical category." [...] Her first impression of love, when she was eight, has become decisive for her whole life. [...] Now she can love only to a certain degree because she's comparing each new experience with the past experience. Kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845.|$|E

50|$|The 24 Hours of Love special {{added to}} the {{suspicion}} among these viewers. This time, it was promoted that a celebrity was to be given full control of the channel for a 24-hour period to air anything she wanted. However, in reality, Love would discover {{it was difficult to}} air music videos that were not already in rotation on MTV2. In addition, the show was broadcast live, and Love was an over-the-top personality who was unafraid to speak <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and complain <b>about</b> the actions of the channel.|$|R
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|Having some {{specific}} ideas in <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> {{the music of}} the film, Madonna contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had helped to write and produce her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. As per her demands, Leonard developed the uptempo song. Madonna came to the recording studio one Thursday, and Leonard handed her a cassette of a recording of the chorus, which he had just finished working on. Madonna went to the backroom and completed the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of it. After finishing the lyrics, Madonna decided to name the song [...] "Who's That Girl", and changed the title of Slammer to the same, considering it to be a better name. In Fred Bronson's book The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits, Leonard explained that the song was recorded in one day with Madonna recording her vocals only once. Additional guitar and percussion tracks were added later by Leonard and Bray.|$|E
500|$|TV Week often {{commented on}} her {{pregnancy}} storyline. After the plot was half way through Erin Miller of TV Week said that Nicole had changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> adopting her baby [...] "more times that Julia Gillard has uttered the phrase 'moving forward'". Upon watching Nicole's beach birth scenes, the magazine website editor quipped [...] "Who knew sand had birthing properties?! Well, maybe not... {{but you could}} forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought it was odd she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting just thinking about it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|That peaks {{should be}} more {{attractive}} than flirtations was inexplicable, but at last in secret confabulation Ida disclosed her motive, and in another private consultation Mrs. Morton begged Miss Gattoni to agree to it, as {{the only means of}} satisfying the young lady, or putting <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> at rest <b>about</b> a fancy her mother could not believe in; though even as she said, 'it would be so very shocking, it is perfectly ridiculous to think my brother Lord Northmoor would be capable,' the shrewd confidante detected a lingering wish that it might be so! ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{she started}} the things they talked of; not because she ever {{seemed to have been}} {{thinking}} of them, or of anything, definitely, but because she was always apparently letting <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> wander <b>about</b> in space, and chanced upon them there. Mostly, however, the suggestions came from Ludlow. He talked of art, its methods, its principles, its duties to the age, the people, the civilization; the large moral uses, which kindled Charmian's fancy, and made Cornelia laugh when Charmian proposed a scheme for the relief and refinement of the poor on the East Side, by frescoing the outsides of the tenement houses in Mott Street and Mulberry Bend, with subjects recalling the home life of the dwellers there: rice-fields and tea-plantations for the Chinese, and views of Etna and Vesuvius and their native shores for the Sicilians and Neapolitans, with perhaps religious histories.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, {{she founded}} a charity called Rajmata Jijau Pratishthan {{to raise funds}} for {{hospitals}} for the poor and women related activities. The charity was in the news for controversial granting of or purchase of land by the government for the charity. Mrs. Patil was well known for speaking <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> particularly <b>about</b> rights for the Maratha community. During her career, she has campaigned for more seats for women in elected bodies. She has also criticized the Indian Central Government's move to extend 27.5 per cent reservation to OBCs in the central academic institutes such as IITs and IIMs. Since her then party, the Nationalist Congress Party led by Sharad Pawar supported this policy, Shalinitai was expelled from that party in 2006. In 2009, she launched a new party called Krantisena Maharashtra. The party did not attract much support and soon Shalinitai joined the Congress party.|$|R
500|$|The single {{also drew}} {{comparisons}} to [...] "Party O'Clock," [...] a 2010 single by American singer Kat DeLuna, also produced by RedOne. In {{a statement issued}} to the New York Daily News, DeLuna said [...] "It's cool that artists like J.Lo are inspired by my musical sound and style. ... Jennifer helped {{pave the way for}} Latinas like myself. I love her", and insisted that there wasn't an issue. DeLuna also noted Lopez as someone who inspired her, and paved the way for someone like her to perform. Following previews of the music video for [...] "On the Floor," [...] DeLuna changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> how she felt with the claims of copying. In another interview with the New York Daily News, several days after the first, she said [...] "I've seen this before, where the more established artist tries to take the vision and artistic ideas away from an emerging artist, and assumes no one will notice because of their bigger shadow,... Luckily, my loyal fans {{and the power of the}} Internet have let the 'Kat' out of the bag." [...] Lopez was interviewed about the issue on Hispanic-American entertainment program ¡Despierta America!. Lopez replied [...] "What? Really? I'm not aware of that...", and when pressed by the presenter a second time, insisted she had not heard rumors of the comparisons.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E

Mann said that Sheila had already heard {{a few things about}} Jade and had made <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> up <b>about</b> <b>her</b> already; she was the wrong girl for her grandson. While looking around Kyle's handyman business, Sheila meets Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) and mistakes her for Jade.
