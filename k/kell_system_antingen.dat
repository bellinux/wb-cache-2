40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is to analyse the pretransfusion testing {{focusing}} on red cells transfusion, important red cell antibodies and transfusion in aloimmunised patients. This thesis {{is supposed to}} sum up the present knowledge of aloimmunisation in modern transfusion medicine, to provide a list of clinically significant antibodies and to determine the aloantibodies incidence in blood samples in pretransfusion testing in hospital Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. The thesis informs about the pretransfusion testing procedure, its requirements and recommendation for laboratory praxis. Furthermore, it describes immunohematologic laboratory methods that use pretransfusion examination. Then, it lists group systems with short description and clinically important irregular antibodies. The summary of actual state of the topic is concluded with the explanation of the term alloimunisation, causes of its emergence and recommendations for phenotypically suitable RBC transfusion preparations choice for aloimmunised patients. In the patient samples before transfusion of preparations containing RBC, we did the pretransfusion testing, i. e. blood type examination in AB 0 /RhD, screening of irregular antibodies against RBC antigens and compatibility test. If the antibody screening was positive, we identified them and eventually processed them through some additional RBC antigens test. After those tests, we used column (gel) agglutination and tube methods. In 7 % of the samples, the irregular antibodies were positive. More than 50 % of them came from women. Aloantibodies were found in 57, 6 % of positive samples. Altogether, we identified 52 antibodies types: anti-E (23, 08 %) > anti-D, -CW (13, 46 %) > anti-c, -K, -Kpa (9, 62 %) > anti-C, -Wra, -Jka, -S, -e, -Fyb, -P 1 (1, 92 %). The majority of identified aloantibodies came from the Rh (68 %) and <b>Kell</b> (19 %) <b>system.</b> Combinations were found in aloantibodies of Rh and/or <b>Kell</b> <b>system.</b> Acording to the results, polytransfused patients and fertile women can be recommended to use this ideal algorithm {{in the choice of}} transfusion preparations containing RBC: to test Rh and <b>Kell</b> <b>system</b> antibodies in the pretransfusion testing and to provide the recipients with transfusion preparations of maximal compliance of RBC antigens in above mentioned systems...|$|R
40|$|The 22 antigens of the <b>Kell</b> {{blood group}} <b>system</b> {{are located on}} a red blood cell (RBC) {{membrane}} glycoprotein that shows sequence homology with a family of metalloendopeptidases. Expression of the <b>Kell</b> <b>system</b> antigens is partially governed by XK, an X-linked gene that encodes the Kx protein; absence of Kx results in reduced Kell antigen expression. Almost total absence of Kell antigens from the RBCs of a German man with no symptoms of neuroacanthocytosis could not {{be due to the}} Kell-null phenotype, Ko, because his RBCs had very weak expression of Kx antigen and his three children were Kp(a + b+). Kell antigens were normal on the RBCs of his son but weak on those of his two daughters. An Nla III restriction fragment-length polymorphism within the KEL gene showed the Kpa/Kpa genotype in the propositus. Sequencing of his XK gene showed a single base change within the donor splice consensus sequence of intron 2. A BsaAl restriction fragment-length polymorphism showed the mutation in both of his daughters but not in his son. The extreme depression of the Kell antigens of the propositus must be due to a combination of effects, ie, homozygosity for Kpa and deficiency of Kx protein, each of which is capable of causing some degree of weakening of Kell antigens...|$|R

Case StudyWe report a case of a clinically significant acute extravascular hemolytic transfusion reaction mediated by previously unrecognized (and undetected) anti-Kpa alloantibody. This reaction occurred in a patient who met all criteria for electronic crossmatch, resulting in the transfusion of an incompatible red cell unit. ResultsPost-transfusion investigation showed the transfused red cell unit was crossmatch compatible at the immediate spin phase but was 3 [*]+[*]incompatible at the antiglobulin phase. No evidence of intravascular hemolysis was observed upon visual comparison of the pre- and post-transfusion peripheral blood plasma. Further testing showed the presence of anti-Kpa antibody. The clinical course of the patient included acute febrile and systemic reaction. ConclusionAcute extravascular hemolytic transfusion reaction may occur due to undetected anti-Kpa alloantibody.

40|$|Background: The KEL gene {{is highly}} polymorphic. It {{presents}} two major alleles, KEL 1 (K) and KEL 2 (k), but {{a variety of}} mutations give rise to weakened (Kmod phenotype) or lack (K 0 phenotype) of Kell antigen expression. Recently, the use of advanced DNA-based techniques has greatly increased {{our understanding of the}} <b>Kell</b> blood group <b>system.</b> Study Design and Methods: Three blood samples that had shown discordant results between the serologic and molecular typing for k were investigated by DNA sequencing. Two of these samples were also subjected to studies of adsorption and elution. Results: After sequencing the whole KEL gene, we found three new missense mutations: c. 455 A>G (p. Tyr 152 Cys) at Exon 5, c. 2111 A>C (p. Pro 704 His) at Exon 19, and c. 1726 G>C (p. Gly 576 Arg) at Exon 16. So far, no known clinical implications are associated with these mutations. Further investigation by adsorption and elution methods has defined that c. 455 A>G and c. 1726 G>C resulted in K 0 phenotype, while c. 2111 A>C encoded a Kmod phenotype. Conclusion: Molecular investigation is an important complement to routine serologic analyses of Kell antigens. Discrepancies between genotype and phenotype may reveal the presence of Kmod or K 0 phenotypes.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} erythrocyte phenotyping {{in blood}} donors and patients with {{sickle cell anemia}} (SS) treated at Hemocentro of Alagoas and describe the frequency and factors associated with erythrocyte alloimmunization. MethodsCross-sectional study with 102 SS patients and 100 blood donors. The following tests were performed: erythrocyte phenotyping, Direct and Indirect antiglobulin test, and detection of irregular antibodies by panel of phenotyped red blood cells. Data were compared by Mann-Whitney, qui-square or Fisher's exact tests. Factors associated with alloimmunization were studied by univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. ResultsThe most frequent antigens found in patients and blood donors were: c, e, M, s, JK(a). Significant differences were observed between {{the frequency of the}} phenotype of patients and donors in regard to antigens s, FY(a) and JK(b). Of 79 transfused patients, 10 presented positive Indirect Coombs. Thirteen alloantibodies were found, 7 of the Rh <b>system,</b> 2 of <b>Kell</b> and 4 were not identified. Factors associated with alloimmunization were the period of time between the last transfusion and the date of the test and more than 10 red blood cell transfusions. Patients who received more than 10 transfusions were 16. 39 (95 % CI: 2. 23 – 120. 59) {{times more likely to be}} alloimmunized than patients with fewer transfusions. ConclusionThe prevalence of alloimmunization in SS patients was 12. 7 %, with 70 % of antibodies belonging to the Rh and <b>Kell</b> <b>systems.</b> This study shows the importance of performing erythrocyte phenotyping in blood donors and receptors to decrease the risk of alloimmunization...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the incidence {{and the rate}} of red blood cell alloimmunization in polytransfused patients. Methods: A polytransfused patient was defined as having received at least 6 units of red cell concentrates during a 3 -month period. The records of all patients (n = 12, 904) who had received red blood cell units were examined retrospectively by searching the computer database at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in São Paulo, Brazil, over a 6 -year period, between 2003 and 2009. Results: During this time, 77, 049 red cell concentrate transfusions were performed in 12, 904 patients. There were 3, 044 polytransfused patients, 227 of whom (7. 5 %) presented with irregular erythrocyte antibodies. The prevalence of alloantibody specificity was: Anti-E>anti-D>anti-K>anti-C>anti-Dia>anti-c>anti-Jka>anti-S in 227 polytransfused patients. We found combinations of alloantibodies in 79 patients (34. 8 %), and the most common specificities were against the Rh and/or <b>Kell</b> <b>systems.</b> These antibodies show clinical significance, as they can cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and perinatal hemolytic disease. About 20 % of the patients showed an IgG autoantibody isolated or combined with alloantibodies. Interestingly, a high incidence of antibodies against low frequency antigens was detected in this study, mainly anti-Dia. Conclusion: Polytransfused patients have a high probability of developing alloantibodies whether alone or combined with autoantibodies and antibodies against low frequency antigens. Transfusion of red blood cells with a phenotype-compatible with RH (C, E, c), K, Fya, and Jka antigens is recommended for polytransfused patients in order to prevent alloimmunization and hemolytic transfusion reactions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{irregular}} {{red blood}} cell alloantibodies, produced by alloimmunization of antigens in transfusions or pregnancies, have clinical importance because they cause hemolysis in the fetus and newborn and in transfused patients. OBJECTIVE: a prospective analysis of patients treated by the surgical and clinical emergency services of Hospital de Clínicas of the Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro (HC/UFTM), Brazil was performed to correlate alloimmunization to clinical and epidemiological data. METHODS: Blood samples of 143 patients with initial negative antibody screening were collected at intervals for up to 15 months after the transfusion of packed {{red blood cell}}s. Samples were submitted to irregular antibody testing and, when positive, to the identification and serial titration of alloantibodies. The Fisher Exact test and Odds Ratio were employed to compare proportions. RESULTS: Fifteen (10. 49 %) patients produced antibodies within six months of transfusion. However, for 60 % of these individuals, the titers decreased and disappeared by 15 months after transfusion. Anti-K antibodies and alloantibodies against antigens of the Rh system were the most common; the highest titer was 1 : 32 (anti-K). There was an evident correlation {{with the number of}} transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high incidence of clinically important red blood cell alloantibodies in patients transfused in surgical and clinical emergency services, we suggest that phenotyping and pre-transfusion compatibilization for C, c, E, e (Rh <b>system)</b> and K (<b>Kell</b> <b>system)</b> antigens should be extended to all patients with programmed surgeries or acute clinical events that do not need emergency transfusions...|$|R

In the present study, the frequency and risk factors for alloimmunization were determined. Transfusion records and medical charts of 828 SCD patients who had been transfused and followed at the Belo Horizonte Blood Center, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, were retrospectively reviewed. Alloimmunization frequency was 9. 9 % (95 % CI: 7. 9 to 11. 9 %) and 125 alloantibodies were detected, 79 % of which belonged to the Rhesus and <b>Kell</b> <b>systems.</b> Female patients developed alloimmunization more frequently (P = 0. 03). The median age of the alloimmunized group was 23. 3 years, compared to 14. 6 years for the non-alloimmunized group (P < 0. 0001). Multivariate analyses were applied to the data for 608 hemoglobin (Hb) SS or SC patients whose number of transfusions was recorded accurately. Number of transfusions (P = 0. 00006), older age (P = 0. 056) and Hb SC (P = 0. 02) showed independent statistical associations with alloimmunization. Hb SC patients older than 14 years faced a 2. 8 -fold higher (95 % CI: 1. 3 to 6. 0) risk of alloimmunization than Hb SS patients. Female Hb SC patients had the highest risk of developing alloantibodies. In patients younger than 14 years, only the number of transfusions was significant.

More than 300 red cell antigens have been identified and further categorized into 30 major discrete systems. Their distribution varies in different communities and ethnic groups. Aims : This work was set to determine the prevalence of red cell phenotypes in donors from the major ethnic groups in Malaysia, namely, Malays, Chinese, and Indians. Materials and Methods : The work utilized the dextran acrylamide gel technique in which four types of gel cards were used to identify the blood groups of 594 subjects collected at the National Blood Transfusion Centre, Malaysia. Results: Blood group O and CDe/CDe (R 1 R 1) were the most common in all ethnic groups. The cde/cde (rr) was more prevalent amongst Indians. The rare phenotypes found were cDE/cDE(R 2 R 2) and cDE/CDE(R 2 Rz). With the Lewis system, the distribution of Le(a-b+) was similar among the ethnic groups. The rarest phenotype Fy(a-b-) was discovered in two donors. Jk(a-b-) was found in seven Malays and in two Indians.

The inci-dence of direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positivity is even greater than overt clinical AIHA. The patho-genesis of AIHA is still unknown, but an imbalance of CD 4 /CD 8 T lymphocytes ratio is believed to play a central role, in addition to a weakened expression of red blood cell (RBC) antigens. 1 Autoantibodies rarely show specificity against antigens of the <b>Kell</b> <b>system.</b> 2 - 5 However, when an anti-Kpb antibody is detected, the selection of compatible blood is extremely difficult, 6 as the frequency of Kpb is 99. 9 %.

This paper presents the <b>Kells</b> mobile storage <b>system.</b> <b>Kells</b> limits untrusted or unknown systems from accessing sensitive data by continuously validating the accessing host’s integrity state. We explore the design and operation of Kells, and implement a proof-of-concept USB 2. 0 storage device on experimental hardware. Our analysis of Kells is twofold. We first prove the security of device operation (within a freshness security parameter ∆t) using the LS 2 logic of secure systems. Second, we empirically evaluate the performance of the Kells device. These experiments indicate that the overheads associated with host validation are nominal, showing a worst case throughput overhead of 1. 22 % for read operations and 2. 78 % for writes. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Red {{blood cell}} {{antibodies}} may cause a positive result of pre-transfusion blood compatibility testing (crossmatch test). It {{can be a}} problem to provide suitable blood units for patients with clinically significant antibodies to high-frequency antigens as well as for those with multiple alloantibody specificities. This study was aimed at identifying transfused patients in the population of South-Backa who had developed clinically significant red blood cell alloantibodies. Material and methods. We analyzed the records of crossmatch results and antibody screening performed at the Blood Transfusion Institute of Vojvodina during 2012. Results. Antibodies were found in 103 patients: A) 63 patients with single antibodies: 1) 16 with antibodies of unknown specificity (3 autoantibodies, 13 alloantibodies); 2) 39 with clinically significant antibodies (23 from Rh system (2 anti-C, 2 anti-D, 12 anti-E, 7 anti-c), 4 anti-K, 3 anti-Fya, 7 anti-Jka, 2 anti-S); 3) 8 with usually not significant antibodies (6 anti-M, 1 anti-A 1, 1 anti- Cw); B) 40 patients developed multiple antibodies: 1) all patients had at least one clinically significant antibody from various blood group system (44 Rh, 13 Kell, 7 Kidd, 7 MNSs (S, s)); 2) 3 patients had usually not significant antibodies (1 Lewis, 2 Lutheran); 3) 3 patients occasionally had clinically significant antibody (3 anti- Yta); 4) 3 patients had antibodies of unknown specificity (2 autoantibodies, 1 alloantibody). Antibodies detected in the majority of patients (65 - 63. 1 %) had a specificity of Rh and/or the <b>Kell</b> <b>system.</b> Conclusions. The main goal of pre-transfusion blood compatibility testing is to detect clinically significant antibodies. The provision of antigen negative blood units for those patients is a special challenge for blood establishments. Database with a sufficient number of typed blood donors can help to resolve this problem...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Thalassemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common genetic {{disorder}} of hemoglobin synthesis in Jammu region. Although RBC transfusion is life saving for these patients, it may be associated with some complications like RBC alloimmunization. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of alloimmunization and the most common alloantibodies involved. Material and Methods: This was a descriptive study involving a total of 70 thalassemic patients in the age range of 2 - 17 years receiving regular blood transfusions, registered at SMGS Blood Bank, Jammu. Relevant clinical and laboratory data was collected with reference to age at the start of transfusions, total number of transfusions received and splenectomy status. Antibodies screening, antibody identification, and cross matching was done on allpatient samples included in the study, during the period between November 2009 and October 2010. Results: In this study, a total of six alloantibodies six patients (8. 5 %) and one autoantibody (1. 42 %) was detected. All identified alloantibodies belonged to Rh system (i. e. anti-E, in 3 patients (50 %), anti D, in one patient (16. 66 %)) and <b>Kell</b> <b>system</b> (anti-K, in two patients (33. 34 %)). Higher frequency of alloimmunization was found, with increase in number of transfusions and in those who received transfusions after 1 year of age. Alloimmunization was not significantly associated with gender and splenectomy status (P-value > 0. 05). Conclusion: Red cell alloantibodies developed in 8. 5 % of thalassemic patients and 1. 42 % had autoantibodies. The most common alloantibodies identified were anti Rh system antibodies (anti-E and anti-D) present in 50 % and 16. 66 % of patients respectively. Alloimmunization is not an uncommon problem faced by blood banks and finding compatible units for regularly transfused thalassemic patients may become very difficult. In order to reduce alloimmunization, a policy for performing extended red cell phenotyping of these patients is essential and at least antigen E and Kell negative blood should be provided for transfusion to these patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: This is {{the first}} study on {{phenotype}} frequencies of various blood group systems in blood donors of south Gujarat, India using conventional tube technique. Material and Methods: A total of 115 "O" blood group donors from three different blood banks of south Gujarat were typed for D, C, c, E, e, K, Jk a, Le a, Le b, P 1, M, and N antigens using monoclonal antisera and k, Kp a, Kp b, Fy a,Fy b, Jk b, S,s, Lu a, and Lu b antigens were typed using polyclonal antisera employing Indirect Antiglobulin Test. Antigens and phenotype frequencies were expressed as percentages. Results: From the 115 blood donor samples used for extended antigen typing in the Rh system, e antigen was found in 100 % donors, followed by D [84. 35 %], C [81. 74 %], c [56. 32 %], and E [21. 74 %] with DCe/DCe (R 1 R 1, 40. 87 %) as the most common phenotype. k {{was found to be}} positive in 100 % of donors and no K+k- phenotype was found in <b>Kell</b> <b>system.</b> For Kidd and Duffy blood group system, Jk(a+b+) and Fy(a-b-) were the most common phenotypes with frequency of 52. 17 % and 48. 69 %, respectively. In the MNS system, 39. 13 % donors were typed as M+N+, 37. 39 % as M+N-, and 23. 48 % as M-N+. S+s+ was found in 24. 35 % of donors, S+s- in 8. 69 %, and S-s+ as the commonest amongst donors with 66. 96 %. No Lu(a+b+) or Lu(a+b-) phenotypes were detected in 115 donors typed for Lutheran antigens. A rare Lu(a-b-) phenotype was found in 2. 61 % donors. Conclusion: Data base for antigen frequency of various blood group systems in local donors help provide antigen negative compatible blood units to patients with multiple antibodies in order to formulate in-house red cells for antibody detection and identification and for preparing donor registry for rare blood groups...|$|R

O presente trabalho tem como objetivo geral avaliar a freqüência de anticorpos antieritrocitários irregulares em politransfundidos, de 1997 a 2005. Através de estudo retrospectivo foram levantados dados no arquivo do HRU de todos os pacientes aloimunizados, realizou-se análise estatística descritiva e comparam-se as proporções pelo teste "Z". Dos 23. 220 transfundidos no período, com média de 5, 7 transfusões por paciente, observou-se a ocorrência de aloimunização em 173 (0, 75 %). Os sistemas Rh e Kell juntos tiveram freqüência {{superior}} a 70 %. A proporção do anti-D foi significativamente maior nas mulheres (p Testing of the pre-transfusional blood phenotype, {{which has}} been carried out at the Regional Blood Bank in Uberaba since 1996, is an important procedure to improve safety of blood transfusions. This study aims to describe the frequency of irregular red blood cell antibodies in multiple-transfused patients from 1997 to 2005. In a retrospective study, data from all alloimmunized patients were collected from the blood bank files. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and a comparison of proportions was made using the Z test. Alloimmunization was observed in 173 (0. 75 %) of the 23, 220 transfused patients, with an average of 5. 7 transfusions per patient. The frequency of the Rh and <b>Kell</b> <b>systems</b> jointly was over 70 %. The proportion of anti-D was significantly higher in women (p< 0. 05) and no difference was noted in the Rh system between Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Seventy percent (70 %) of the patients were over 30 years of age. Out of the 73 patients with registered diseases, 39. 73 % had acute anemias, 31. 51 % chronic anemias and 28. 77 % oncological or onco-hematologic diseases. Approximately 70 % of antibodies were discovered before the 10 th transfusion. The low frequency of alloimmunization observed at the Regional Blood Bank of Uberaba reinforces the importance of pre-transfusional blood phenotype screening for all multiple-transfused patients as well as its adoption as a common practice in all hemotherapy center...|$|R
