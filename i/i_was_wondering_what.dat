6000|$|... "Ah, {{here comes}} Wilson. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{had become of}} him. He promised to come on, {{as soon as he}} had seen his chief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was thinking," [...] she answered, after a moment's hesitation, [...] "of Stella. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{it must be}} to her {{to have to give}} up {{all these}} {{beautiful}} things." ...|$|E
60|$|JOANNA (airily). Nothing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> he <b>is</b> doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Egad, Richard," [...] said my Lord, {{when we had}} got to my lodgings, [...] "I {{made him}} change colour, did I not? Do {{you know how the}} little fool looks to me? 'Od's life, he looks hunted, and cursed near brought to earth. We must fetch this thing to a point, Richard. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> Chartersea's next move will be," [...] he added thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not {{out when}} I left {{the gates of}} Paris," [...] said Blakeney meditatively; [...] "so quietly has {{the news of the}} escape <b>been</b> kept, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> devilry that brute Heron can be after. And now no more chattering," [...] he {{continued}} lightly; [...] "all to horse, and you, Hastings, have a care. The destinies of France, mayhap, will be lying asleep in your arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! yes!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{interest}} {{you could have}} in penetrating the mystery of her death. Tell me! Confide in me! I am dying to know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Is that it?' {{said the}} schoolmaster. 'That {{explains}} it at once. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> the devil {{you were going}} to send them to Yorkshire for. Ha! ha! Oh, I understand now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{this dark}} talk might mean the company broke up, the lady Blanche gliding away {{through a door}} {{at the back of}} the dais, followed, as I noted, by Deleroy who seemed flushed and angry.|$|E
40|$|Dear Douglas: It {{has been}} so long since I wrote you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{incidents}} <b>I</b> have told you and which ones I have forgottenâ€”not that there is much exciting to tell, for life seems to go along in rather a hum-drum fashion during the cold months. We had difficulty with the car during the severe weather and finally found out that we needed a new pump so installed that, and it is going beautifully again [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Na, na," [...] {{answered}} Andrew boldly; then shaded {{away his}} negative with, [...] "unless it be on Fastern's-e'en, {{or the like}} o' that--But indeed it's no muckle matter what the folk do to the midden pootry, for they had siccan a skarting and scraping in the yard, that there's nae getting a bean or pea keepit for them.--But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> it <b>is</b> that leaves that turret-door open;--now that Mr. Rashleigh's away, it canna <b>be</b> him, <b>I</b> trow." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Shindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to {{tell you}} the truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> the deuce I could do this evening. Don't know a soul in Tchicahgo. I wonder if you happen to know whether there's a good theater in this city?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Richard, I am so {{glad you}} are here. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> had become of you. And Comyn, too." [...] Whispering to me, [...] "Mamma has had a letter from Mrs. Brice; your {{grandfather}} has been {{to walk in the}} garden." ...|$|E
60|$|I spoke him {{in return}} as handsomely as I was able; {{but all the}} while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> would come next, and why he had parted with his {{precious}} guineas; for as to the reason he had given, a baby would have refused it.|$|E
60|$|While Robertson and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{we should}} do with the poor old {{creature}} whom it seemed cruel to leave here to perish, she cleared up the question by suddenly expiring before our eyes. Uttering the name of someone with whom, doubtless, she had been familiar in her youth, {{three or four times}} over, she just sank down and seemed to go to sleep and on examination we found that she was dead. So we left her and went on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{made you}} look so altered, Lizzie,' said Lady Merton, 'and now <b>I</b> see it <b>is</b> your hair being straight. I like your curls better.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, {{maybe it}} would be a good thing if I just WENT. I was {{wondering}} if anybody really needed me. Or wanted me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> was the use of my living. I've been getting so stupid and ugly--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Five dollars; {{they paid}} {{up part of}} the time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> to do with them. Guess they've no money. They didn't come in to supper, though we would have stood them that. Made me think they were {{straight}} folks; the other kind wouldn't have been bashful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you <b>are</b> Ralph. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{you would}} <b>be</b> like. Uncle {{has been telling}} me you <b>were</b> coming. <b>I</b> like your looks, and <b>I</b> think you <b>are</b> nice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 16 December 1907 {{letter to}} Mgr. Benson's brother, British {{physicist}} Sir Oliver Lodge wrote, [...] "The assumption {{that there can}} be no religion except a grotesque return to Paganism, short of admitting the supremacy of Mediaeval Rome, is an unexpected contention to find in a modern book... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> the leaders of the Church think of it. Perhaps Pius X may approve; but it is difficult to suppose that it can meet with general approbation. If it does, it is very instructive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I knew!" [...] she assented drily. [...] "But we are {{wandering}} from the point. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> has brought you here. Have you come direct from England?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There is {{my cousin}} De la Noue!" [...] Francois exclaimed, as he alighted from his horse. [...] "This is good fortune. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> we should do, {{if we did}} not find him here;" [...] and {{he made his way to}} where a {{singularly}} handsome gentleman was talking with several others.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "It {{makes you}} quite {{invaluable}} as a companion. 'Pon my word, it {{is a great}} thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P'r'aps you'd better start, in {{case she}} reckernizes my voice," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Pitch it in strong about me and 'ow <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> had 'appened to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|The boys {{resumed their}} seats. 'Your mamma and <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> you boys <b>are</b> to become, {{and we do}} not see any {{openings}} likely to occur here. Now, what should you say to us all emigrating?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{has been}} telling me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing well," [...] he said. [...] "Have you only just come? <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> had had become of you. You looked so pale, yesterday, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid you might be ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|We breakfasted as silently on {{his part}} as we had supped, but when we had finished, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{he was going to}} let me do with myself, and on the whole what the deuce I had come for, he said, in the longest speech I had yet had from him, [...] "Wouldn't you like to come up and see what I've been doing?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Charlie, {{carrying}} the cup, {{came to the}} table. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> {{would be the first}} thing she would say. If it had been Charlie, of course he'd have said, 'This is the life!' but I looked for something snappier from her. If I had been in her place there were at least ten things I could have thought of to say, each nastier than the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{a moment}} or two this state of affairs took my {{attention}} off from the lion that had caused it, but whilst <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> on earth was to be done next, and how we should manage if the cattle broke loose into the bush and were lost--for cattle frightened in this manner will so straight away like mad things--my thoughts were suddenly recalled to the lion in a very painful fashion.|$|E
6000|$|...
