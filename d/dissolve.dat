Bacteria, viruses and phytoplankton are the major contributors of <b>dissolved</b> DNA in seawater, although contribution to the <b>dissolved</b> DNA pool by phytoplankton remains speculative. <b>Dissolved</b> DNA is degraded and assimilated in the marine environment by bacteria but relatively little is known about their identity. Using a fluorescent method to quantify <b>dissolved</b> DNA concentration and RNA Stable Isotope Probing, this study aims to determine the seasonal cycle of <b>dissolved</b> DNA from spring to early summer at the L 4 coastal time-series station in the Western English Channel, and to identify <b>dissolved</b> DNA utilising microorganisms. During this study <b>dissolved</b> DNA followed a seasonal trend at L 4, with lowest concentrations in winter months and highest concentrations in summer months. Correlations between <b>dissolved</b> DNA and plankton abundance at L 4 suggests phytoplankton, specifically Dinoflagellata {{could be a}} significant source of <b>dissolved</b> DNA.
