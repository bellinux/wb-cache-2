In this technique the <b>fibroid</b> is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the <b>fibroid</b> through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells.

25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine <b>fibroid</b> versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} <b>fibroid</b> is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a <b>fibroid,</b> it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E

30|$|Uterine <b>fibroids</b> are {{the most}} common {{neoplasms}} of the female genital tract. It is estimated that 50 % of women of reproductive age will have one or more uterine <b>fibroids</b> [2]. Since the majority of women with <b>fibroids</b> are fertile, {{it is clear that the}} presence of <b>fibroids</b> does necessary impair fertility. It is estimated that <b>fibroids</b> are the sole cause of subfertility in 2 – 3 % of subfertile women [2].|$|R
25|$|Some {{women with}} uterine fibroids {{do not have}} symptoms. Abdominal pain, anemia and {{increased}} bleeding can indicate the presence of fibroids. There may also be pain during intercourse, depending on {{the location of the}} <b>fibroid.</b> During pregnancy, they may also be the cause of miscarriage, bleeding, premature labor, or interference with the position of the fetus. A uterine <b>fibroid</b> can cause rectal pressure. The abdomen can grow larger mimicking the appearance of pregnancy. Some large fibroids can extend out through the cervix and vagina.|$|E

Ehigiegba et al. [2] removed single <b>fibroids</b> when they were well above 5  cm; in their study, most of patients had multiple <b>fibroids</b> which were intra-mural in location.

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} fibroids is not clearly understood, {{but the current}} working {{hypothesis}} is that genetic predispositions, prenatal hormone exposure {{and the effects of}} hormones, growth factors and xenoestrogens cause <b>fibroid</b> growth.

25|$|Progesterone antagonists such as {{mifepristone}} {{have been}} tested, {{there is evidence}} that it relieves some symptoms and improves quality of life but because of adverse histological changes that have been observed in several trials it can not be currently recommended outside of research setting. <b>Fibroid</b> growth has recurred after antiprogestin treatment was stopped.|$|E
25|$|A small {{population}} of the cells in a uterine <b>fibroid</b> have properties of stem cells or progenitor cells, and contribute significantly to ovarian steroid-dependent growth of fibroids.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHigh {{intensity}} focused ultrasound ablation is a {{new technique}} {{for the treatment of}} uterine <b>fibroids.</b> Its efficacy is influenced by the blood perfusion of the <b>fibroids.</b> Oxytocin is a promising drug which may decrease the blood flow to the <b>fibroids.</b> In this study, the alterations of blood flow to the uterine <b>fibroids</b> were observed using contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) before and after the use of parenteral oxytocin. MethodsA total of 40 women with 42 <b>fibroids</b> (mean ± standard deviation, 5. 8  ±  1. 9  cm; range, 3. 1 – 12. 9  cm) underwent CEUS before and after intravenous infusion of oxytocin at 0. 1  U/min. The CEUS time-intensity curves were drawn, the maximum signal intensity, the time-to-peak intensity and mean transit time of the <b>fibroids</b> were measured to observe the changes of perfusion after the use of oxytocin. ResultsAfter the use of oxytocin, the wash-in of microbubbles was significantly slowed down on CEUS in all patients. The maximum signal intensity of the <b>fibroids</b> decreased significantly and the time-to-peak intensity and mean transit time of the <b>fibroids</b> were prolonged significantly after the use of oxytocin in all patients (p <  0. 05). The results suggested that the blood flow in the uterine <b>fibroids</b> was significantly decreased by the use of parenteral oxytocin. ConclusionThis CEUS study demonstrated that the use of parenteral oxytocin can significantly reduce the blood perfusion of the uterine <b>fibroids,</b> which may help to enhance the therapeutic efficacy for high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of uterine <b>fibroids...</b>|$|R
30|$|Uterine <b>fibroids</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} benign uterine tumors and have an age-specific cumulative incidence in the USA that is nearly 70 % among white women and greater than 80 % among black women [1]. Uterine <b>fibroids</b> are estimated to occur in approximately 20 – 25 % of adult women overall with symptoms that may involve menorrhagia and subfertility as well as bulk symptoms. Despite numerous alternatives to hysterectomy, over 200, 000 hysterectomies are performed for <b>fibroids</b> annually in the USA [1, 2]. There is also a lack of consensus regarding optimal therapy for uterine <b>fibroids,</b> so that more than 150  years after the first abdominal hysterectomy for <b>fibroids,</b> there is no definitive clinical evidence for what constitutes the “best” treatment for <b>fibroids</b> [3].|$|R
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} not needed {{if there are}} no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help with pain and bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. Iron supplements may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the <b>fibroid</b> or uterus may help. Uterine artery embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} guided focused ultrasound, is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) {{that uses}} high intensity focused ultrasound waves to destroy tissue {{in combination with}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment. During the procedure, delivery of focused ultrasound energy is guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging. Patients who have symptomatic fibroids, who desire a non-invasive treatment option and {{who do not have}} contraindications for MRI are candidates for MRgFUS. About 60% of patients qualify. It is an outpatient procedure and takes one to three hours {{depending on the size of}} the fibroids. It is safe and about 75% effective. Symptomatic improvement is sustained for two plus years. Need for additional treatment varies from 16-20% and is largely dependent on the amount of <b>fibroid</b> that can be safely ablated; the higher the ablated volume, the lower the re-treatment rate. There are currently no randomized trial between MRgFUS and UAE. A multi-center trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of MRgFUS vs. UAE.|$|E

Percentage of collagen-stained area was estimated using Masson-Trichrome-stained slides. Collagen fibers were observed with picrosirius staining. Tissue stiffness was objectively measured by rheometry (complex shear modulus [Pa]). Injected materials spread within and beyond <b>fibroids</b> as visualized by methylene blue. Of the 8 treated <b>fibroids,</b> 7 were softened and some contained liquefied centers. Relative percentage of collagen-stained area (mean+ standard deviation) in treated <b>fibroids</b> (38 + 12 %; n 7) was less than that in control <b>fibroids</b> (66 + 17 %; n 5). Treated myometrium (40 + 30 % collagen; n 3) was similar to control myometrium (53 + 8 %; n 2). Picrosirius staining demonstrated loss of collagen fibers in treated <b>fibroids.</b> Treated <b>fibroids</b> were less stiff (3630 + 2410 Pa; n 4) than controls (5930 + 830 Pa; n 4). Treated and control myometrium had similar stiffness (2149 + 927 Pa; n 3 and 3314 + 494 Pa; n 2, respectively) and were never lique-fied. In conclusion, injections of CHC into encapsulated <b>fibroids</b> are feasible and effective. Heterogeneity of collagen types and quantities within individual <b>fibroids</b> may contribute to varied responses and need additional investigation. Further study of collat-eral effects on myometrium is indicated. Injected CHC has potential for treatment of <b>fibroids...</b>|$|R
