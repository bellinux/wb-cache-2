40|$|The {{security}} challenges being {{encountered in}} many places today require electronic means of controlling access to secured premises {{in addition to the}} available security personnel. Various technologies were used in different forms to solve these challenges. The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Based Access Control Security system with GSM technology presented in this work helps to prevent unauthorized access to controlled environments (secured premises). This is achieved mainly {{through the use of a}} Radio Frequency Identification System with operating frequency of 125 KHz, Microcontroller programmed to send control signals, DC motor, relay, buzzer, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and GSM/GPRS Modem. Once the RFID tag which contains the user’s unique information is scan by the RFID reader and confirmed match with the information stored in the microcontroller, the microcontroller is instructed to turn ON the DC motor through L 293 D driver, display “USER NUMBER and CARD NUMBER” on the LCD and activates the GSM/GPRS modem to send SMS alert “AUTHORIZED, valid RFID card shown, User is allowed to enter, user number” to security personnel. Else, the DC Motor remained OFF, LCD displays “READ RFID CARD NOT VALID”, buzzer turns ON for about 5 seconds and GSM/GPRS modem activated to send “ UNAUTHORIZED, invalid RFID card is used to access the security system” to the security personnel. The electronic circuit was implemented, the codes for microcontroller were written in assembly language, debugged and compiled using the KEIL Micro vision 4 integrated development environment. The resultant Hex files were programmed into the memories of the microcontrollers with the aid of a universal programmer. Hardware simulation was carried out using the Proteus Virtual System Modelling (VSM) version 8. 0. An importation implication of this paper is that the system is cheaper to maintain and more efficient in comparison with a manually operated type or <b>key</b> <b>lock</b> <b>system.</b> The RFID based access control system can be useful in providing security for homes, organizations, and automobile terminals to increase the level of securit...|$|R
50|$|The Super Famicom Box {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as the Neo-Geo Deck and combines Super Famicom console hardware with a coin acceptor. The system connects to a TV and has two conventional Super Famicom controllers for gameplay. A user can obtain five minutes of gameplay by inserting a 100-yen coin. One peculiarity of the Super Famicom Box (compared to its console counterpart) is its use of system-specific multicarts that contain two or three games per cartridge, unlike the use of conventional cartridges such as with the Nintendo M82 system. These cartridges are much larger than conventional Super Famicom cartridges. The system can accept up to two of these cartridges at the same time. A hinged cover {{on the front of}} the Super Famicom Box allows the installation and removal of cartridges. The front cover is secured when closed by a <b>keyed</b> <b>lock</b> at each end. Another <b>keyed</b> <b>lock</b> allows the <b>system</b> to be turned on and off. A special onscreen menu allows the user to select and launch a game. The system incorporates additional hardware not found in the home console to manage the game selection screen and the onscreen messages that direct the user to insert money. The Super Famicom Box cartridge that contains Super Mario Kart, Star Fox and the Super Mario Collection is required to operate the system as it also contains the system BIOS. The games from the Super Famicom Box multicarts are identical to traditional Super Famicom games.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} fleet cards {{can be traced}} back to the 1960s and 70s when <b>key</b> stops/key <b>locks</b> and stand alone card locks were used by {{independent}} marketers and filling station owners. A Key Stop or <b>Key</b> <b>Lock</b> fuel control <b>system</b> was a system where a group of commercial fleets could access a fuel pump with a unique key that tracked solely their gallons through that pump. This technology is obsolete and no longer available commercially. A card <b>lock</b> control <b>system</b> uses a punch card or magnetic stripe card to uniquely identify a fuel buyer on a private server. This was done to avoid a credit card interchange fee which raised the cost of fuel considerably. The first commercial fuel cards resembled a credit card with a name and a company logo on them. When a customer entered a fueling station, the cashier would take down the customer’s name and company information to authenticate ownership of the card. This process was time consuming and was vulnerable to fraudulent transactions. With the advent of computers and computer software in the 1980s, the development of the fleet card industry quickly expanded. The invention of the magnetic stripe and magnetic card reader allowed petroleum marketers to control fuel pump transactions, leading to today’s wide range of fleet card security features and state of the art reporting systems to track all fleet expenses. These “intelligent” systems make fleet management convenient and secure, as fleet card owners are able to track fleet fuel use with increased accuracy, receiving reports in real time on the fueling habits. Business owners are able to limit employee fueling by time-of-day and day-of-week.|$|R

The first stage is identification and second one is verifying that whether he is a genuine user or imposter.

Based on the rank retrieved an alarm is activated automatically when any unauthorized person tries to open the door.

Unfortunately, as {{in case of}} uni-biometric systems, multi-biometric systems also face the problems of nonrevocability, lack of template diversity, and possibility of privacy compromise. A combination of biometrics and cryptography is a good solution eliminate these limitations. In this chapter we present a multi-biometric cryptosystem based on the fuzzy commitment scheme, in which, a crypto-biometric key is derived from multi-biometric data. An idea (recently proposed by the authors) denoted as FeaLingECc (Feature Level Fusion through Weighted Error Correction) {{is used for the}} multi-biometric fusion. The FeaLingECc allows fusion of different biometric modalities having variation in performances (e. g., face+iris). This scheme is adapted for a multi-unit system based on two-irises and a multi-modal system using a combination of iris and face. The difficulty in obtaining the crypto-biometric <b>key</b> <b>locked</b> in the <b>system</b> (and in turn the reference biometric data) is 189 bits for the two-iris system while 183 bits for the iris-face system using brute force attack.

40|$|A passive {{decomposition}} {{framework for}} the formation and maneuver controls for multiple rigid bodies is proposed. In this approach, the group dynamics of the multiple agents is decomposed into two decoupled systems: The shape system representing internal group formation shape (formation, in short), and the <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> abstracting the overall group maneuver as a whole (maneuver, in short). The decomposition is natural in that the shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> have dynamics similar to the mechanical systems, and the total energy is preserved. The shape and <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> can be decoupled {{without the use of}} net energy. The decoupled shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> can be controlled individually to achieve the desired formation and maneuver tasks. Since all agents are given equal status, the proposed scheme enforces a group coherence among the agents. By abstracting a group maneuver by its <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> whose dynamics {{is similar to that of}} a single agent, a hierarchical control structure for the multiple agents can be easily imposed in the proposed framework. A decentralized version of the controller is also proposed, which requires only undirected line communication (or sensing) graph topology. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2764507...|$|R
