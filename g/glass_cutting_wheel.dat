2500|$|The {{can opener}} is a device used to open metal cans. Most non-electrical can openers today use the hand-cranked rotary version {{consisting}} of a wheel with serrated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin cans. The first rotary can opener with a <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented in 1870 by William W. Lyman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who received a U.S. Patent 105,346 on July 12, 1870. In 1925 the Star Can Opener Company of San Francisco improved on Lyman's wheel blade by adding a second, serrated or toothed wheel, called a [...] "feed wheel" [...] or [...] "turning gear" [...] to ride below {{the rim of the}} can and rotate the can against the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Whereas all {{previous}} openers required using one hand or other means {{to hold the}} can, can-holding openers simultaneously grip the can and open it. The first such opener was patented in 1931 by the Bunker Clancey Company of Kansas City, Missouri and was, therefore, called the [...] "Bunker". It featured the now standard pliers-type handles, when squeezed would tightly grip the can rim, while turning the key would rotate the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel,</b> progressively <b>cutting</b> the lid along the rim. The <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> is coupled to a serrated feed wheel via a set of gears, as in the Star design. The Bunker company was absorbed by the Rival Manufacturing Company, also of Kansas City, in 1938.|$|R

40|$|Slot-cutting {{tests were}} made in a 3. 5 in. OD steel pipe {{representative}} of the proposed liner of the twin gravel-packed horizontal drainholes used in this Method, for the following purposes: (1) To determine the force required to punch through the liner wall {{in order to achieve}} its full penetration with a <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel,</b> (2) To select the most effective profile for the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel.</b> The results of these tests, made at UC-Berkeley indicated that, with four <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels,</b> as included in the tool design presented in the Fourth Quarterly Report, the total force required was nearly 60, 000 lb. In view of the limited tool diameter, the creation of such a large force with a single piston required a hydraulic pressure which would exceed the capability of the Triplex pump, most commonly available in the oil fields. A re-design of the 4 -wheel slot-cutting tool with two tandem pistons was done, but revealed a high degree of complexity, related to the difficulty of providing a high-pressure fluid path in the thin housing wall from the hydraulic cylinder above the first pair of arms to a cylinder for the tandem piston located below the first pair of cutter arms and operating the second pair of arms. By reducing the number of <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels</b> from 4 to 3 a single piston driver was sufficient and could result in a tool much simpler to build and to maintain in the Field. The re-designed 3 -wheel slot-cutting tool is presented here. It is currently under construction at UC-Berkeley. A second test program will follow, when this simplified modular tool has been assembled. The objective of this second series of tests is to determine the required characteristics of the opposing spring, or Belleville rings stack which, in the new design, is used for retraction of the cutters, rather than for their extension...|$|R

40|$|The Diploma thesis "Silesian Baroque Cut Glass in the {{collection}} of Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague" deals with {{the collection}} of Silesian Baroque cut glass at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague spanning from {{the last quarter of the}} 17 th century to the third quarter of the 18 th century. The thesis describes the technique of <b>glass</b> <b>cutting</b> and its history. It also deals with the beginnings of <b>glass</b> <b>cutting</b> in Silesia, which are associated with the Schaffgotsch family in the Hirschberger Valley. Worth mentioning is also the renowned glass cutter Friedrich Winter, who along with his glass workshop substantially influenced Silesian <b>glass</b> <b>cutting</b> in the following decades. The thesis also mentiones other well-known glass cutters, particularly Christian Gottfried Schneider. The chapters dealing with the development of the shape and ornament of Silesian Baroque cut glass are important for correct classification by periods and localities.

Most of the catalogue's objects have not been published thus far or were often never presented in detail if they appeared in literature...|$|R
3000|$|The EPB shield {{uses the}} {{excavated}} material by the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> as the support medium {{to maintain the}} stability of the cutting face, and the supporting pressure is heavily dependent on the plastic flow of the muck in the earth chamber. In particular, ensuring high plastic flow of the muck matters when operating the 10.22  m diameter shield is important because the excavated volume per meter by the machine is nearly 2.8 times greater than that by the 6.15  m diameter shield. When shield driving in the soils of this project, high fluidity cannot be achieved by filling the excavation chamber with the excavated soil. Moreover, the soil conditioning should take place directly during excavation at the face in front of the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> to prevent the material sticking to <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels.</b> Besides choosing suitable conditioning agents, the 10.22  m diameter shield machine should be equipped with necessary components to realize the uniform injection of the agents and the full agitation of the agents with the excavated soils. Three aspects of the machine design were involved in the machine type selection stage: (1) devices for injecting bentonite slurry and foam liquid, and corresponding layouts of pipelines, (2) locations and amounts of injection ports, and (3) the agitating device to actively and independently mix the additives with the soils.|$|R

50|$|A {{can opener}} (in North American English and Australian English) or tin opener (in British and Commonwealth English) is a device used to open tin cans (metal cans). Although {{preservation}} of food using tin cans had been practiced {{since at least}} 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced. The first can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented in 1870 but was considered too difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A breakthrough design came in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> on the ring of the can. This easy to use design {{has become one of}} the most popular can opener models.|$|R
