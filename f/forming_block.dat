These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the micelles are not soluble in the solvent of the micelle solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the micelles are found. Kinetically frozen micelles are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This {{block copolymer}} {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core <b>forming</b> <b>block,</b> PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high glass transition temperature which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO micelles of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the micelle solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these micelles was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed. Moreover, the stability against dilution and vast range of morphologies of kinetically frozen micelles make them particularly interesting, for example, for the development of long circulating drug delivery nanoparticles.|$|E

While high yields of macromonomers are possible with methacrylate monomers, low yields are obtained when using catalytic chain transfer agents during the polymerization of acrylate and styrenic monomers.

The setup presented here enabled the measurement of the TODT with high temperature resolution while the birefringence measurements were nondestructive and straightforward compared to alternative methods. A downward shift in the transition temperature was found for all samples upon application of the electric field. The data indicate that the dominating parameter that evokes the mixing of block copolymers when exposed to electric fields is the difference in dielectric permittivity Δϵ between the block copolymer constituents. The extent to which the TODT is shifted is furthermore influenced by the degree of polymerization N.

Thicker regions between substrate features (plateaus) exhibit in-plane cylinders aligned in the crystallization direction and thinner regions over the substrate features (mesas) display vertically aligned cylindrical domains. This approach is a simple and general technique for engineering an intended domain orientation in specific areas of a block copolymer film.

40|$|Stabilization of {{nanoparticles}} by block copolymers does allow accurate {{control of}} particle size and inter particle distance, and offers {{the possibility of}} producing thin optically transparent films and a new technique for lithography in the nanometer range. The approach is based on micelles of diblock copolymers with a polar core, which are formed in organic solution and whose core is able to bind a transition-metal compound. Chemical conversion of the inorganic species within the nanocompartment is employed to prepare sterically stabilized inorganic crystallites or clusters. The particle size and interparticle distance of these crystallites or clusters can be controlled exclusively by the film <b>forming</b> <b>block</b> copolymer. Controlled coagulation of spherical block copolymer micelles allows to agglomerate several clusters of equal size in one compartment and to prepare strings of the clusters.

The {{building blocks for}} these materials, AB(_ 2) macromonomers, are synthesized by living anionic polymerization and are well-defined in terms of molecular weight and polydispersity. The nature of the coupling reaction used to generate the highly branched HyperMacs results in branched polymers with a distribution of molecular weights and architectures. Previously a strategy for the synthesis of polystyrene HyperMacs {{has been reported in}} which the extent of reaction was limited by an unknown factor. In this thesis the modifications made to the synthetic strategy are reported for the production of more highly branched polystyrene HyperMacs or 'super' HyperMacs. Other variations along this theme include the addition of a B 3 core creating core HyperMacs. Modifications to the improved HyperMac synthesis enabled the construction of polybutadiene AB(_ 2) macromonomers, resulting in polybutadiene HyperMacs; as well as triblock copolymer AB(_ 2) macromonomers constructed from polystyrene and polyisoprene <b>forming</b> <b>block</b> copolymer HyperMacs termed HyperBlocks.

Melt rheology showed polystyrene HyperMacs to be thermorheologically simple and HyperMacs showed little evidence for relaxation by reptation. Their rheological behaviour agreed well with the Cayley tree model for hierarchical relaxation in tube models of branched polymers. HyperBlocks showed phase separated morphologies with two distinct glass transition temperatures for their constituents.

40|$|Polymers nanocomposites (PNCs) {{have emerged}} as a {{promising}} class of materials that can exhibit enhanced mechanical, optical, and electrical properties over polymers or nanoparticles alone. The outstanding issue is that the parameter space associated with PNCs is vast and a global framework for what parameters and processing conditions determine the resulting structure is lacking. Polymer field theory has been established as the primary tool in understanding inhomogeneous polymer systems. Here, we extend the polymer field theory framework to efficiently model PNCs, which we refer to as polymer nanocomposite field theory (PNC-FT). The utility of the PNC-FT method {{is the ability to}} efficiently study the thermodynamics and vast parameter space associated with PNCs. The PNC-FT method is developed to efficiently model a wide array of systems: nanospheres, nanorods, grafted nanoparticles with simple (homopolymer) and complex (diblock, mixed, and Janus) grafting architectures. Moreover, a numerical dynamic mean-field theory (DMFT) is presented as an additional tool to capture non-equilibrium behavior in PNC systems. The PNC-FT framework is validated through comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations and by demonstrations of the ability to capture particle correlations, a feature that is not captured in the conventional polymer field theory framework. The PNC-FT method is used to study: the ideal domain spacing of lamellar <b>forming</b> <b>block</b> copolymer nanocomposites, the segregation of homopolymers and nanoparticles to tilt grain boundaries in block copolymer thin films, complex grafted nanoparticles acting as surfactants in a homopolymer blend, and grafted gold nanorods in polymer thin films. The grafted gold nanorod study is done in direct collaboration with experimentalists where we provide an additional systematic study that demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of: a previously developed hybrid particle-field theory (HPFT), PNC-FT, and DMFT. In investigating this wide range of systems, we demonstrate the efficacy of the PNC-FT and DMFT approaches in developing paramter-structure-property and process-structure-property relationships in PNCs, respectively. ...|$|E
