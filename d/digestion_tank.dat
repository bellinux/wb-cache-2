50|$|In sewage {{treatment}} systems, an anaerobic filter (AF) {{is a form}} of anaerobic digester. The <b>digestion</b> <b>tank</b> contains a filter medium where anaerobic microbial populations—organisms that live in the absence of oxygen — can establish themselves. Such filters are commonly employed in the treatment of waste water. These reactors are gaining in popularity versus more established aerobic waste-water treatment systems because they produce a less solid residue than do other types of filter.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} contribution reviews actual {{status of}} biogas {{production in the}} European countries {{with a focus on}} the Slovak municipal WWTPs. In 49 monitored Slovak WWTPs (out of 520) the anaerobic digestion with biogas production is operated. The total volume of <b>digestion</b> <b>tanks</b> is about 195 000 m 3 but the total daily biogas production is only approx. 55 000 m 3 d– 1. From a technological point of view, the <b>digestion</b> <b>tanks</b> have sufficient space for considerable increase of biogas production. The increase can be achieved by the choice and dosing of external organic sources that could bring significant energy – economic contribution to WWTP operation without technological process adaptation (plant oils, fats, organic materials, etc.) or with a small technological process adaptation (food residues, food and agricultural products and wastes).

40|$|The {{research}} on generation of biogas {{was carried out}} as one of subjects in a project which has been promoted to make pig feeds using food recyclable resources. The {{aim of the research}} was to recycle all of leftover foods collected except those used as the pig feeds. A 1 m^ 3 <b>digestion</b> <b>tank</b> and some small 18 ℓ tanks were provided. The former was placed in a vinyl house to examine the effect of heating by the sun, and the latter ones were kept at a temperature of about 38 ℃ so as to be appropriate for methane fermentation to find the biogas generation rate. It was found that the biogas generation rate for the leftover foods of 1 kg was 70 ℓ/kg a day and a proper amount of leftover foods for the tank volume of 1 m^ 3 was appropriately 11 kg/m^ 3 a day. This means that, for instance, a <b>digestion</b> <b>tank</b> with the volume of 20 m^ 3 and leftover foods of 220 kg per day were needed if you require biogas of 16 m^ 3 per day which is equivalent to kerosene of 10 ℓ as the calorific value. It is effective in heating the <b>digestion</b> <b>tank</b> to place it in a vinyl house. Although the heating is necessary in wintertime or nighttime, the subtropical climate at Okinawa is advantageous to methane fermentation. Therefore it is considered that the electricity consumption for the heating could be saved much more by use of renewable energies such as solar water heaters, solar batteries or small-sized wind power generators...|$|E

The author carried out some experiments on anaerobic bacteria, especially the organisms of Clostridium and methane-producing bacteria found in samples of night-soil. The studies were performed with a view to contributing to fundamental studies on gas production in the digestion of night soil. 1. Of anaerobic bacteria found in raw night-soil, digested sludge and supernatant in a <b>digestion</b> <b>tank</b> on a pilot plan, the organisms of Clostridium accounted for the majority. They were always detected in larger numbers in digested sludge than in supernatant, and there was little change in their numbers during the whole period of experiments. 2. When 11 strains of Clostridium isolated from night-soil were implanted in Prevot 2 ̆ 7 s methane-producing mediums, none of them were shown to be capable of producing methane by itself. There was, however, a production of methane in one medium inoculated with one of the series of sets of 5 strains selected at random from among the 11 strains, the amount produced representing 4. 8 per cent of the total amount of gases produced. When each one of these 11 strains was implanted in a Laigret 2 ̆ 7 s medium separately, there was a production of methane in two mediums, representing 7. 4 and 5. 1 per cent, respectively, of the total amounts of gases produced. All this happened when inoculation of the medium with the strains under study was repeated over and over again. 3.

As with composting, the anaerobic digestion process must comply with BSI PAS 100 and compost should meet “Quality Control for Compost” requirements (Environment Agency 2010).
