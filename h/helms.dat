5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, <b>Helms</b> {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, <b>Helms</b> defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. <b>Helms</b> defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked <b>Helms.</b> It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, <b>Helms</b> would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. <b>Helms</b> was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that <b>Helms</b> had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; <b>Helms</b> retained by cheating.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory <b>Helms,</b> and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, <b>Helms</b> announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, <b>Helms</b> and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which <b>Helms</b> won. Subsequently, <b>Helms</b> wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw <b>Helms</b> confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when <b>Helms</b> was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called <b>Helms</b> a joke. <b>Helms</b> responded by slapping Lawler, who hit <b>Helms</b> back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating <b>Helms</b> in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

5|$|<b>Helms</b> {{continued}} {{defending his}} title against other cruiserweights, while on occasion facing off against SmackDown!'s other title holders in champion versus champion matches. <b>Helms</b> faced World Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio on June 16 and United States Champion Bobby Lashley on July 7 but lost both matches. Eventually, <b>Helms</b> became the longest cruiserweight champion in WWE history, {{as well as}} the longest reigning champion of any kind in SmackDown! history. For much of late 2006, he feuded with Matt Hardy, with whom <b>Helms</b> exchanged several victories in matches on SmackDown!. In Helms' hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina, at the 2006 No Mercy pay-per-view, Hardy beat <b>Helms.</b> The two rivals also joined opposing teams at Survivor Series, where <b>Helms</b> was in Team Rated-RKO, and Hardy was a member of Team DX; Team Rated-RKO lost the match.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helms</b> {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jimmy Wang Yang over the Cruiserweight Title, after a tag team match in which Matt Hardy and Yang {{defeated}} <b>Helms</b> and Sylvan. The feud ended after <b>Helms</b> defeated him to retain the title at Armageddon in December 2006. In 2007, <b>Helms</b> once again feuded with the entire Cruiserweight division on SmackDown!. During this feud, Helms' reign as Cruiserweight Champion {{came to an end}} at No Way Out, when he was unable to win a Cruiserweight open invitational, which saw Chavo Guerrero win the championship. Shortly after losing the championship, <b>Helms</b> formed a tag team with Guerrero, but they did not win any matches as a team.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2006, <b>Helms</b> {{suffered}} a broken nose. After complaining to Long {{about having to}} wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told <b>Helms</b> {{that he did not}} have to defend his title, but put <b>Helms</b> in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, <b>Helms</b> attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw <b>Helms</b> back into the ring, resulting in <b>Helms</b> losing the match. <b>Helms</b> underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that <b>Helms</b> had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. <b>Helms</b> returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. <b>Helms</b> continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
