25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{for a moment and}} continued down to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape and could see the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of the}} road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E
2500|$|Kubrick {{shot the}} film in England: in Cambridgeshire, on the Norfolk Broads, and at the former Millennium Mills, Beckton Gas Works, Newham (east London) and the Isle of Dogs. A former RAF and then British Army base, Bassingbourn Barracks doubled as the Parris Island Marine boot camp. A British Army rifle range near Barton, outside Cambridge, {{was used in the}} scene where Hartman congratulates Private Pyle for his {{shooting}} skills. Kubrick worked from still photographs of Huế, taken in 1968, and found an area owned by British Gas that closely resembled it and was scheduled to be demolished. The disused Beckton Gas Works, a few miles from central London, were filmed to represent Huế after attacks. Kubrick had buildings blown up, and the film's art director used a wrecking ball to knock specific holes in certain buildings over the course of two months. Originally, Kubrick had a plastic replica jungle flown in from California, but once <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> he was reported to have said, [...] "I don't like it. Get rid of it". The open country was filmed in the Cliffe marshes, and along the River Thames, supplemented with 200 imported Spanish palm trees and 100,000 plastic tropical plants from Hong Kong.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in silence. Then {{he looked}} at me--also in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... (Thrusting Linda back {{to right}} front and striding up to Hubbard.) Give it to me. (Hubbard passes it to him, and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> crumples {{it in his}} hand, and grinds it under foot.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Pause. Giggles, slight struggle, and {{a slap on}} Kipps' coatsleeve. A passerby appears {{down the}} path, and she hastily withdraws her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] said Bill, [...] "mebbe he’s been in {{the water}} a week or two, and can’t quite make it out. See how <b>he’s</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> now." ...|$|R
60|$|Marie {{brought him}} {{the bill of}} fare, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> gravely.|$|E
60|$|Wells's {{face was}} there. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{and saw that}} Wells was afraid.|$|E
60|$|She {{wrote it}} down. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with uplifted eyebrows, but made no remark.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{feels as}} if he had been forced into doing what we want," [...] went on Dave. [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as if you had used that Mrs. Breen {{incident}} as a club over him." ...|$|R
50|$|In the TV sitcom Cheers, Sam Malone {{loves the}} {{paintings}} (in particular one of Dogs Playing Blackjack) while his more sophisticated lover, Diane Chambers, hates them. Sam {{says that he}} sees something new every time <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> - such {{as one of the}} dogs cheating.|$|R
6000|$|... [JOHN {{goes to the}} door, and as {{he opens}} it, BASIL [...] averts his head. When JOHN shuts the [...] door after him, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with staring, [...] frightened eyes, half mad with agony. He [...] tries to contain himself. After a while [...] JOHN comes back, very quietly.|$|R
60|$|Her fingers {{yielded the}} bracelet--a tawdry, ill-designed affair of rubies and diamonds. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> disapprovingly.|$|E
60|$|The priest put {{the paper}} into Esmond's hand. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It swam before his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> a moment, then savagely tore it {{in pieces}} {{and flung it}} in the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guess the Colonel isn't used to back talk, Craig. If he wasn't {{quite so}} high-toned, he'd {{go home and}} throw things about. What he wants is {{somebody}} to stand right up to him. You'll have him plumb up against you right along; where you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a thing one way, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> another. It's clean impossible that you should agree." ...|$|R
60|$|Brand {{took the}} sheet of unintelligible {{characters}} into his own hand. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> blankly <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aristotle (384-322 BCE) {{noted that}} the image of the sun {{remained}} in his vision after <b>he</b> stopped <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{thought the}} mate, Mr. Burns, {{who could not}} hide his {{amusement}} and contempt whenever <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once more he stooped {{and picked}} up a small clock. It had stopped at eleven-fifteen. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|The cell {{to which}} the boys were {{conducted}} was a small one, and horribly dirty. Jack shrugged his shoulders, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Baas," [...] he {{said with}} a curious grin, [...] "that is how I reckon. If anybody beats Jantje, Jantje cuts a notch upon the stick, and every night before he goes to sleep <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and says, 'One day you will strike that man twice who struck you once,' and so on, Baas. Look, what a line of them there are, Baas. One day I shall pay them all back again, Baas Frank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll {{have to go}} now, Walter, {{because of}} the train--and the children.' And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me. <b>It</b> seems hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Gluck aloud, after <b>he</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for {{a little}} while, [...] "if that river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did so, and {{at sight}} of his scarlet face, the color {{deepening}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> he sank down nervelessly in a chair.|$|E
60|$|A {{slight smile}} passed across Mr. Withers' face, {{and his wife}} saw {{that that was not}} at all the way in which <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{threw back}} the curtain {{and took his}} arm. The table was laid for two. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in bewilderment {{and then back at}} her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> {{straight}} <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{and then}} straight over it. [...] "It's too monstrous that one can't ask {{you as a}} friend what one wants so to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aren't {{you going}} to have breakfast?" [...] I urged. The clock at that moment began to ring a sonorous twelve. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with subdued irritation.|$|R
60|$|The form fluttered {{from his}} fingers on {{to the floor of}} his sitting-room. <b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> dazed. Outside, a mob of people, {{standing}} round his carriage, were shouting his name.|$|R
6000|$|He found Lavendie and Noel in the drawing-room, {{standing}} before the portrait which was nearing completion. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for a long minute, and turned away: ...|$|E
6000|$|I went to {{the third}} counter to the right, and showed my sample to the {{salesman}} in attendance there. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> on both sides. Then he said: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{took out a}} pocket-book and drew from it a small photograph, holding it out towards the doctor. The firm face {{softened}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in that light," [...] remarked Leo to Benjy, as {{they lay}} {{down to sleep}} that night. [...] "I {{have no doubt that}} the man whom he styles first father wrapped up the thing, {{whatever}} it is, to keep it safe, not to make a mystery of it, and that his successors, having begun with a mistaken view, have now converted the re-wrapping of the bundle by each successive heir into a sacred obligation. However, we may perhaps succeed in overcoming the old fellow's prejudices. Good-night, Benjy." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the knee. <b>It</b> was red and stiff.|$|R
60|$|Engleton {{came to the}} table, {{and drew}} a card at random from the pack. Forrest's eyes seemed to narrow a little as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> down <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Engleton had drawn another ace.|$|R
