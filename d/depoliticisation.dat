40|$|The {{argument}} that representative democracies are experiencing {{an age of}} <b>depoliticisation</b> has become increasingly prominent. However, there has been too little reflection on the assumptions made about politics within the <b>depoliticisation</b> literature. This {{has led to a}} lack of precision in terms of how we identify (de) politicisation empirically and the grounds upon which we can normatively critique it. To address this, the article changes the terms of the <b>depoliticisation</b> debate and asks not what we can learn about politics by thinking more about <b>depoliticisation,</b> but what we can learn about <b>depoliticisation</b> if we think more about politics. How politics is defined, in spatial, temporal and activity terms, hugely influences how we might understand <b>depoliticisation.</b> Three prominent and contrasting definitions of politics are shown: politics as the institutions of government (politics lens 1), politics as choice and contingency (politics lens 2) and politics as the apparatus of order and consensus versus ‘political’ moments of antagonism (politics lens 3). By considering these ontologies of politics, the article teases out some of their strengths and weaknesses in capturing the <b>depoliticisation</b> ‘crisis’. The article concludes by considering the benefits of a multi-lens approach to <b>depoliticisation</b> as a preliminary step to encourage greater reflexivity and debate...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the concept}} of <b>depoliticisation</b> has existed as an {{important}} theme {{in a range of}} disciplines for some time, in recent years it has become a significant issue for scholars interested in European politics, governance and public policy. Within the same period <b>depoliticisation</b> has been championed by government ministers and proposed by think tanks and pressure groups at the national level as a solution to both public policy and constitutional challenges. At the global level <b>depoliticisation</b> has been promoted by the World Bank and United Nations as a means through which developing countries can enhance state capacity and market credibility. However, the wider literature on <b>depoliticisation</b> has arguably failed to offer any definitional clarity. Nor has it sought to tease apart and deconstruct {{the concept of}} <b>depoliticisation</b> in order to distinguish between different types of <b>depoliticisation</b> tactics or understand the interplay between them. This article gleans insights from a number of disciplines and synthesises the wider literature in order to offer a multi-level analytical framework. This framework, it is suggested, facilitates a deeper understanding of contemporary <b>depoliticisation</b> strategies, tools and tactics while also providing an insight into shifts in contemporary modes of governance...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 9594 This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{transformation}} of the state in Northern Ireland (NI) and what is at stake politically in that transformation. More specifically, it is an empirically grounded social-theoretical investigation into the relationship between state universality and <b>depoliticisation</b> in {{the transformation of the}} NI state. I address this question by investigating historical <b>depoliticisation,</b> sovereignty and citizenship. I am interested in a specific dimension of the state: the ?idea of the state?. This refers to the production of the symbolic identity of the state such that the state is disassociated from any particular group, raising it to the level of universality. I thus focus on {{the way in which the}} identity and the universality of the post-GFA state are constructed. In terms of what is at stake politically, I analyse a process of what I call <b>depoliticisation</b> in the transformations under investigation. I draw on the work of Alan Badiou (2005; 2010) and Jacques Ranciere (1998; 2001), both of whom allow us to conceptualise the specificity of politics and therefore to clearly conceptualise <b>depoliticisation.</b> <b>Depoliticisation</b> is conceptualised in two senses. On the one hand, <b>depoliticisation</b> refers to the reduction of political subjectivity to the logic of identification, a move which eliminates the universal dimension of political subjectivity. On the other hand, <b>depoliticisation</b> refers to the monopolisation of universality by the state...|$|E
40|$|This article disentangles {{the complex}} {{relationship}} between <b>depoliticisation</b> and anti-politics in public-private partnership (PPP) policies and practices. By identifying three social mechanisms that underlie dynamics of <b>depoliticisation</b> in PPPs, namely consultocracy, yield bias, and complex contracting, it contrib-utes {{to the growing}} interdisciplinary literature on <b>depoliticisation.</b> The article argues that as <b>depoliticisation</b> continues to evolve, it further increases the unbalance between <b>depoliticisation</b> and politicisation, which has negative implications for democratic governance. The depoliticised logic behind PPPs feeds broad sen-timents of political distrust and disappointment, because political decision makers tend to use PPPs as mir-acle solutions for the delivery of public infrastructure without bearing the long-term budgetary conse-quences of their own decisions. This constitutes an expectations gap: {{the difference between what}} is prom-ised or expected by politicians on the one hand, and what they can actually deliver on the other. It is here that the short-term rationales and incentives of political decision makers collide with the wider public inter-est in the longer term. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Approaches to <b>depoliticisation</b> {{have tended}} to focus on its use as a {{domestic}} strategy. The purpose of <b>depoliticisation,</b> whether discourse-, rule-, or institution-based, is to distance or limit the political character of a particular issue or policy. Where the literature on <b>depoliticisation</b> tends to be lacking is in its international role. This paper seeks to explore how imperialist policies, that is policies intended to dominate one state by another, have been depoliticized by being channeled through technically- managed or apparently economic institutions. The paper situates an account of <b>depoliticisation</b> in terms of the nature of global capitalist society, and seeks to explore how imperial strategy was depoliticized through the Sterling Area. The paper looks at an episode in British-Malayan relations in which the apolitical character of the Sterling Area is brought into question. The purpose of this strategy of <b>depoliticisation,</b> as with its domestic instances, is to remove accountability from state managers, provide them with greater governing autonomy and to limit social instability, {{while at the same time}} trying to remove barriers for capital accumulation on a global scale...|$|E

Analysis has examined the effects of <b>depoliticisation</b> tactics on the public, but not how those tactics are sustained during moments of political tension. Drawing on policy networks and agencification literatures, this article examines how these tactics are resilient against pressure for politicisation. Using an in-depth case study of the controversial appraisal of cancer drug Herceptin in 2005 / 6 by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the article examines how ‘resilient’ NICE was to external politicisation. It is argued that NICE was resilient because it was effectively ‘insulated’ by formal procedures and informal norms of deference to scientific expertise. This mechanism is termed ‘institutional double glazing’. The conclusion suggests developments to the conceptual and methodological framework of <b>depoliticisation,</b> and highlights theoretical insights into the nature of ‘anti-politics’ in contemporary democracies...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>depoliticisation</b> and repoliticisation in post-colonial Indonesian film adaptations, {{primarily}} focusing on Blood and Crown of the Dancer (1983) and The Dancer (2011), the two adaptations of Ahmad Tohari’s novel The Dancer (1982). The investigation {{is motivated by}} a series of problems in adaptation studies, namely, the hegemony of Anglo-American texts, the domination of former British colonies in post-colonial adaptation, and the homogenising construct of the East versus the West in most post-colonial criticism. The novel and the film adaptations recount the long, internal struggles between the military and civil society in the Dutch former colony after the independence. What is prevalent yet forgotten in those works and the domestic conflicts that they emulate is the practices of <b>depoliticisation</b> and politicisation, which have regularly been associated with, respectively, the denial of politics by the military regime and the corruption of ‘apolitical’ realms by its political enemies. This thesis aims to show that the <b>depoliticisation</b> and politicisation in the novel and the adaptations are much more subtle and complex than imagined. Incorporating Flinders and Wood’s theory of <b>depoliticisation,</b> Foucault’s principle of discourse, and Bourdieu’s account of capital, the investigation attempts to capture the discursive <b>depoliticisation</b> and politicisation in the texts as well as the interrelated governmental, societal, and personal factors in adaptation. Although the thesis is structured by the three texts, each chapter draws equal attention to the contexts, subjects, and audiences of each work and scrutinises all of them through the lenses of <b>depoliticisation</b> and repoliticisation. The analysis shows that the <b>depoliticisation</b> and politicisation in the texts generally correspond with those in the governmental, societal, private arenas in their respective eras, particularly on the problems of politics, religion, and sexuality. The novel and the first adaptation embody the typical <b>depoliticisation</b> during the Indonesian military era (1966 - 1998) in which subversive discourses and practices could surface only as a pretext/justification for the regime’s suppression. The second adaptation, however, signifies the heavy politicisation in the early post-military era (1998 - 2004) and the subtle <b>depoliticisation</b> in the subsequent time in that it simultaneously interrogates and adapts ‘faithfully’ the issues and the conflicting parties in the informing texts and contexts. Although the case studies are rather specific, the chosen texts and approach allow the thesis to deal with broader issues related to the socio-political history of Indonesia, the literary and filmic discourses and practices, and, in relation to the missing first film adaptation, the cultural status of adaptation studies and practices in the country. Despite their obvious focus on domestic affairs, there are traces of Hollywood’s depoliticising models in both adaptations due to the long, predominant influence of American cinema in Indonesia. This fusion of intracultural and intercultural elements, the transdisciplinary political approach, and the insight from the invisible post-colonial country are the major contributions of the thesis to adaptation studies and post-colonial adaptation.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} {{and implications of}} creating non-elected community-based bodies for India's national watershed development programme in 1994. A discourse of <b>depoliticisation</b> is in use to justify the creation of ‘apolitical’ watershed committees in contrast to ‘political’ panchayats, ostensibly unsuitable for participatory development for their embodiment of political contestation and vested interests. The discourse masks conflicts between key actors in India's development process and is highly malleable, acquiring pertinent meanings in specific contexts. Case-study evidence from two project villages in a south Indian district shows that the attempt to depoliticise this programme of panchayat politics fails, but sets up the ground for <b>depoliticisation</b> of another sort, by distancing watershed project spaces from pro-poor progressive politics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a political economy analysis of <b>depoliticisation</b> {{in the context}} of the crisis of neo-liberalism in Western Europe. Following a discussion of the theoretical foundations of the concept, it emphases that whilst <b>depoliticisation</b> strategies are often associated with neo-liberalism, such strategies have a longer trajectory existing even within Keynesian regimes. The paper then details the many forms taken by <b>depoliticisation</b> within neo-liberal governing regimes focusing on the reorganisation of civil society and the state from the late 1970 s to the present primarily with examples from the UK. It suggests, contrary to much popular discussion, that there is a significant degree of continuity in the form of economic manage-ment followed before, during and after the recent financial crisis of 2008 / 09. Both in terms of ideology and practice, many governments have maintained and even deepened their commitment to depoliticised gov-erning principles. However it seems clear that attempts to depoliticise neo-liberal economic policy have not enabled state managers to avoid the emergence of crisis at the level of the state. Contrary to accounts which argue in simplistic fashion that `economic’ crisis produces `political’ crisis, this paper suggests that crisis is best understood as expressed simultaneously in both economic and political forms. Crisis at the level of the state precipitated in part by the entrenchment of depoliticised governing strategies is not simply the result of economic crisis but is an aspect of that crisis contributing to its depth and apparent insolubility. In this way the paper challenges some critiques of <b>depoliticisation</b> which have suggested (Hay 2014, 303) that the concept is in part both fatalistic and functionalist removing much of the political contingency of the moment of crisis itself. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how practices of leadership have been negotiated and {{have changed over}} time {{in the context of}} a grassroots health promotion project in Lima, Peru. Tracing these trajectories in the context of the evolution of women's organising in Peru informs a broader analysis of the changing role of grassroots women in development projects, feeding into debates around the professionalisation and <b>depoliticisation</b> of grassroots activism and providing new empirical material on gendered experiences of grassroots leadership. The paper recognises the increasing dominance of neoliberal management mechanisms but argues that the <b>depoliticisation</b> of grassroots women leaders is not simply a straightforward trickledown of neoliberal development practices but is produced through the interplay of local socio-political processes and personal biographies of activism with more macro-level development trends and discourses...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} build on Peter Burnham's {{analysis}} of New Labour's <b>depoliticisation</b> statecraft {{as set out in}} an earlier volume of this journal. While Burnham provides a convincing account of how this new governing strategy differed from earlier 'politicised' methods of governance, we know less about why such change took place. Burnham makes a start by suggesting that developments in the international financial system go some way to explaining this shift. The main argument of this article is that this account of change needs to be supplemented by a focus on domestic factors. It is asserted below that politicised strategies failed in part because state managers governed within a strategically selective context which penalised the deployment of more activist and discretionary policy instruments in industrial affairs. Instead, this context was more favourable to the <b>depoliticisation</b> techniques which have emerged in the 1980 s and the 1990 s. ...|$|E

40|$|Pointing to its radical {{underpinnings}} {{in so-called}} ‘Open Marxism’ and its {{theory of the}} state (one that subsumes {{the state in the}} capital relation), this article critically scrutinises Peter Burnham's thesis of ‘depoliticisation’ as a dominant accumulation strategy and regime. The article identifies ambiguities around Burnham's depiction of New Labour in power as committed to <b>depoliticisation.</b> It addresses these by drawing a distinction between regime of accumulation and mode of regulation, characterising New Labour's political economy in terms of the latter as a form of depoliticised Keynesianism framed by ‘discretionary constraint’. Contra-Burnham, the article points to the continued efficacy of Keynesian and social democratic political agency {{in the context of a}} dialectic of <b>depoliticisation</b> and repoliticisation focused on the role and power of the state.

The forced <b>depoliticisation</b> generated by repression and fears under the military government marked the genesis of political deactivation.

In addition, in recent years politicians and politics in general have experienced in Chile a growing decrease of prestige and credibility.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} notion of ‘post-democracy’ {{elaborated}} by Colin Crouch, which indicates an increasing tendency towards the deterioration of democratic principles and the narrowing of the public sphere, this book explores how, in the Dutch context, this process is influenced by theatre and performance practice, art policy and governmental action. It points out that, within discourses of post-democracy, aspects of <b>depoliticisation</b> are commonly assessed through theatrical concepts such as spectacle, play, game and theatre. At the same time, this work argues by an analysis of three performances, ‘Wijksafari Utrecht’ by Adelheid Roosen, a political protest by Quinsy Gario, and ‘Labyrinth’ by the refugee group ‘We are Here Cooperative’, {{that there might be}} a role for theatre in this age of <b>depoliticisation.</b> It proposes to scrutinise, based on the writings of Samuel Weber, a paradox of theatre. Namely, while concepts of theatre are applied to convey disapproval of government and politics, theatre has a possible emancipatory character to dispute the given order...|$|E
40|$|The key {{challenge}} {{humanitarian intervention}} is facing when protecting a universal human rights, {{is that it}} allows the intervener that defines its interest in terms of the ethical end, that is, universal human rights, to transcend the political – defined in terms of actors with different socio-political aims – that is, to depoliticise its actions. This act of <b>depoliticisation</b> in humanitarian intervention allows the intervener to ignore the role of power in politics – that is, to mutually adjust and settle the different socio-political aims – and thus not to be enquired about the restraint necessary in the pursuit of its own socio-political aims against other states. The main question of the thesis is: can the act of <b>depoliticisation</b> in humanitarian intervention protect universal human rights in the post-Cold War era? To answer this question, this thesis uses the humanitarian interventions in Kosovo in 1999 and Libya in 2011 as examples, and argues that when the act of <b>depoliticisation</b> in post- Cold War humanitarian intervention attempts to transcend the political, it presents the interests of the intervening actors in a manner that blurs the distinction between what they accept as universal human rights in theory and their practice of humanitarian intervention that presents their own socio-political aims, namely, to advance one mode of the pursuit of human rights that entails their decision to support one ally in the target state, and to confine universal human rights to their rights, while denying it to the alienated party. Having blurred this distinction, when <b>depoliticisation</b> in the theory and practice of post-Cold War humanitarian intervention ignores the role of power in politics, in practice, it justifies the status quo of the exclusionary force that imposes one mode of pursuit of human rights in the target state, based on the socio-political aims of the intervener. It, thus, presents a paradox that undermines the role of humanitarian intervention to protect universal human rights in the post-Cold War era, as states, with their clashing socio-political aims, use force to protect the human rights of their allies rather than universal human rights...|$|E

In this article I welcome the debate this special issue has opened, but defend the first wave against its critics. More specifically, I argue that the first wave literature provides ample analytical and theoretical resources to capture the dynamic interplay between depoliticising tendencies and politicising or repoliticising counter-tendencies which its critics rightly place at centre stage. Indeed, I go further, suggesting that the more empirical contributions of the special issue, while bringing a series of new and important insights to the analysis of politicisation–depoliticisation dynamics, in fact do so by drawing extensively on first wave <b>depoliticisation</b> theory.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of the global governance of refugees in light of studies on <b>depoliticisation.</b> Following theories on governmentality, it emphasizes the centrality of the concept of de-politicisation when examining the narratives and practices implemented to establish an extraterritorial asylum system of humanitarian containment, detached from any ideals of inclusion and rehabilitation. At the same time, we recall diverse empirical evidence in order to stress the importance of considering the divergent effects of <b>depoliticisation</b> in geographically and culturally distant contexts. The survey in Ca-labria, Italy, presents in fact the political attempt by its inner areas to foster autonomous practices of in-clusion that contrast the securitarian shift of the global asylum system, as well as its national implications, recognising refugees as a strategic factor of economic growth and social innovation. In particular, we re-veal the mechanisms through which new forms of local citizenship have emerged here, along with institu-tional solutions specifically connoted by a bilateral and place-based approach to forced migration. These efforts persist despite the breakup of the current European refugee crisis which, however, now opens new dilemmas by diminishing the viability of refugee relocation within the internal areas as a truly sustainable process. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This article applies a {{modified}} version of the theoretical approach of the Copenhagen School to demonstrate that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has since 2001 reacted in a twofold way to the complex political obstacles to closer counter-terrorism co-operation: First, it has responded with securitising terrorism as a transnational crime and, second, with a <b>depoliticisation</b> and ‘ASEANisation’ of its counter-terrorism policies. <b>Depoliticisation</b> and ‘ASEANisation’, i. e. the framing of a security threat under the ASEAN Way values, are both deliberate political actions. They enable politicians to base co-operation among the ASEAN members and with outside powers on a non-political, technical basis. Contradicting an assumption of the Copenhagen School, this study argues that in South-East Asia where sovereignty and non-interference are still core principles this approach can offer better political opportunities to resolve a security threat than a ‘classic’ securitisation. Furthermore, this article demonstrates that ASEAN’s anti-terrorism policies reflect its fragmented version of human security, which is based on national and regime rather than individual security. As counter-terrorism does not enjoy political priority in the region, these policies can only be a weak trigger for the implementation of ASEAN’s notion of human security...|$|E
