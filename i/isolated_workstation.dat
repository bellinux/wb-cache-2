40|$|The {{performance}} of CBIR algorithms is usually measured on an <b>isolated</b> <b>workstation.</b> In a real-world environment the algorithms would only constitute a minor component {{among the many}} interacting components. The Internet dramati-cally changes many of the usual assumptions about measuring CBIR performance. Any CBIR benchmark should be designed from a networked systems standpoint. These benchmarks typically introduce communication overhead because the real systems they model are distributed applications. We present our implementation of a client/server benchmark called BIRDS-I to measure image retrieval performance over the Internet. It has been designed with the trend toward the use of small personalized wireless systems in mind. Web-based CBIR implies the use of heteroge-neous image sets, imposing certain constraints on how the images are organized {{and the type of}} performance metrics applicable. BIRDS-I only requires controlled human intervention for the compilation of the image collection and none for the generation of ground truth in the measurement of retrieval accuracy. Benchmark image collections need to be evolved incrementally toward the storage of millions of images and that scaleup can only be achieved through the use of computer-aided compilation. Finally, our scoring metric introduces a tightly optimized image-ranking window. Comment: 24 pages, To appear in the Proc. SPIE Internet Imaging Conference 200...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} not just about the future of {{computerized}} design practice. It is about what to do today in contemplation of tomorrow-the issues of computercentered practice and the courses of action open to us can be discerned by the careful observer. The realities of computerized design practice are different from the issues on which design education still fixes its attention. To educators, the present paper recommends further clinical research on computerized design firms and suggests that case studies on the matter be developed and utilized as teaching material. Research conducted by the author of this paper indicates that a new form of design firm is emerging-the computerized design firm-totally supported and augmented by the new information technology. The present paper proceeds by introducing an abridged case study of an actual totally electronic, computerized design practice. Then, the paper concentrates on modelling the computerized design firm as an intelligent system, indicating non-trivial changes in its structure and strategy brought about by the introduction of the new information technology into its operations - among other considerations, different strategies and diverse conceptions of management and workgroup roles are highlighted. In particular, this paper points out that these structural and strategic changes reflect back on the technology of information with pressures to redirect present emphasis on the individual designer, working alone in an <b>isolated</b> <b>workstation,</b> to a more realistic conception of the designer as a member of an electronic workgroup. Finally, the paper underlines that this non-trivial conception demands that new hardware and software be developed {{to meet the needs of}} the electronic workgroup - which raises issues of human-machine interface. Further, it raises the key issues of how to represent and expose knowledge to users in intelligent information - sharing systems, designed to include not only good user interfaces for supporting problem-solving activities of individuals, but also good organizational interfaces for supporting the problem-solving activities of groups. The paper closes by charting promising directions for further research and with a few remarks about the computerized design firm's (near) future...|$|E
40|$|Applications {{and systems}} are today {{becoming}} increasingly demanding {{in terms of}} resources. While an <b>isolated</b> machine or <b>workstation</b> normally imposes a restrictive ceiling on the resources available to a process, a distributed computational grid {{can act as a}} virtual machine capable of hitherto unimagined processing power. To that end, the objective of the research in this thesis is to build an extension to the Dynamic Soft Realtime Scheduler for Windows NT (DSRT/NT) that will allow for the accommodation of remote real-time requests. The major contributions of this work are: (1) Introducing a broker to handle remote requests (2) Establishing a directory-based service for selecting one of many server nodes (3) Providing APIs for ensuring some minimal QoS guarantees. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended DSRT/NT in providing remote multimedia applications with soft real-time services at a considerably small cost of overhead...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the control of}} {{switching}} servers, which can for example be found in manufacturing industry. In general, these systems are discrete event systems. A server processes multiple job types. Switching between the job types takes time and during that time, no jobs can be processed, so capacity is lost. How should a server switch between the job types in an efficient way? In this paper we derive the optimal process cycle with respect to work in process levels for a server with two job types and finite buffer capacities. The analysis is performed using a hybrid fluid model approximation. After the optimal process cycle has been defined, a state feedback controller is proposed that steers the trajectory of the system to this optimal cycle. Workstations are often placed in series to form a flowline of servers. Our goal is to control flowlines of switching servers {{in a way that}} the work in process level is minimized. In a flowline, only the most downstream workstation influences the work in process level of the system, since upstream workstations simply move jobs from one server to the other. If it is possible to have the most downstream workstation process in its optimal cycle and the other workstations can make this happen, then optimal work in process levels are achieved. This paper investigates under which conditions the upstream workstations can make the most downstream workstation work optimally. Conditions on the upstream workstations are derived and the class of flowlines is characterized for which the optimal process cycle of an <b>isolated</b> downstream <b>workstation</b> can become the optimal process cycle for the flowline. For a flowline consisting of two workstations, a state feedback controller is proposed and convergence to the optimal process cycle is proved mathematically. An extensive case study demonstrates how the controller performs, for both the hybrid fluid model and in a discrete event implementation with stochastic inter-arrival and process times...|$|R
