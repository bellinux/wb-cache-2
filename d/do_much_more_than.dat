Because {{of the influence of}} Queen Leonor, who would become his greatest patron in the years to come, Gil Vicente realized that his talent would allow him to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> simply adapt his first work for similar occasions.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 1957, {{two ships}} {{set to be}} {{scrapped}} broke from their moorings and collided with the Hawthorne Bridge. Two {{of the most powerful}} diesel tugs available were unable to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> relieve some of the strain from the bridge. The Portland was able to free the ships and tow them to moorings before the strain broke the bridge. The Columbia River Pilots Association saw this incident as justification for having insisted that the Portland be a steam-powered sternwheeler.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> most now do.|$|E

500|$|Although the FVdG {{insisted that}} the [...] "goal is {{everything}} and ... must be everything" [...] (a play on Bernstein's formula that [...] "the final goal, whatever it may be, is nothing to me: the movement is everything"), it was unable to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> keep its own structures alive during World War I. Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible {{except for a few}} minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando Borghi, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher René Descartes {{expanded}} {{upon this}} idea and is most widely known by {{his work on}} the mind-body problem. Often, Descartes' ideas were looked upon as overly philosophical and lacking in sufficient scientific background. [...] Descartes focused much of his anatomical experimentation on the brain, paying specific attention to the pineal gland – which he argued was the actual [...] "seat of the soul". Still deeply rooted in a spiritual outlook towards the scientific world, the body was said to be mortal, and the soul immortal. The pineal gland was then thought to be the very place at which the mind would interact with the mortal and machine-like body. At the time, Descartes was convinced the mind had control over the behaviors of the body (controlling the man) – but also that the body could have influence over the mind, which is referred to as dualism. This idea that the mind essentially had control over the body, but man's body could resist or even influence other behaviors was a major turning point in the way many physiologists would look at the brain. The capabilities of the mind were observed to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> simply react, but also to be rational and function in organized, thoughtful ways – much more complex than he thought the animal world to be. These ideas, although disregarded by many and cast aside for years led the medical community to expand their own ideas of the brain and begin to understand in new ways just how intricate the workings of the brain really were, and the complete effects it had on daily life, as well, which treatments would be the most beneficial to helping those people living with a dysfunctional mind. The mind-body problem, spurred by René Descartes, continues to this day with many philosophical arguments both for and against his ideas. However controversial they were and remain today, the fresh and well-thought-out perspective Descartes presented has had long-lasting effects on the various disciplines of medicine, psychology and much more, especially in putting an emphasis on separating the mind from the body in order to explain observable behaviors.|$|E
