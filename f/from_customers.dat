5|$|For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden {{commissioned}} an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport. The aeroplane {{was converted}} into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically. It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback <b>from</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd.

5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response <b>from</b> <b>customers</b> confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
