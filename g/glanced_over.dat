25|$|As {{the play}} began, {{everything}} appeared {{to go as}} planned. Jones ran with Wycheck up the field {{at the beginning of}} the play. However, as the pass was being delivered to Dyson, Jones, who was at the goal line, <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his left shoulder and noticed an open Dyson catching the ball. Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but his legs were wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.|$|E
500|$|The {{invention}} {{that brought}} Lawrence to international fame {{started out as}} a sketch on a scrap of a paper napkin. While sitting in the library one evening in 1929, Lawrence <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> a journal article by Rolf Wider√∏e, and was intrigued by one of the diagrams. This depicted a device that produced high-energy particles by means of a succession of small [...] "pushes". The device depicted was laid out in a straight line using increasingly longer electrodes. At the time, physicists were beginning to explore the atomic nucleus. In 1919, the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford had fired alpha particles into nitrogen and had succeeded in knocking protons out of some of the nuclei. But nuclei have a positive charge that repels other positively charged nuclei, and they are bound together tightly by a force that physicists were only just beginning to understand. To break them up, to disintegrate them, would require much higher energies, of the order of millions of volts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{figure had}} {{walked away from}} them to a {{distance}} of about 120ft (36.5 m) before Patterson began to run after it. The resulting film (about 59.5 seconds long at 16 fps) is initially quite shaky until Patterson got about 80ft (24.4 m) from the figure. At that point, the figure <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> its right shoulder at the men and Patterson fell to his knees; on Krantz's map this corresponds to frame 264. To researcher John Green, Patterson would later characterize the creature's expression as one of [...] "contempt and disgust...you know how it is when the umpire tells you 'one more word and you're out of the game.' That's the way it felt." ...|$|E
