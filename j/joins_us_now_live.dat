40|$|Human {{beings are}} not simple to understand. Even if they were, most of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live</b> {{in a complex}} world that has allowed us to become {{detached}} from the natural patterns and drivers that have shaped humans and human consciousness over millennia of evolution. To try and understand how and why people behave {{the way they do}} in modern society requires us not just to understand the human side of the equation, but also to understand {{a great deal about the}} social context in which this behaviour occurs. The purpose of this paper is to set out a number of different perspectives that can be used to understand and interpret behaviour. It sets these out within a framework that demonstrates how each approach can contribute something valuable towards developing a broad view of behaviour. Within this paper the term ‘behaviour’ is used to refer simply to ‘what people do’ in the broadest terms. WARNING! The intention behind this paper is to act as a simple introduction to a range of theories that come from very distinct academic backgrounds, and to present them in a way that encourage policies to be developed that take them all into account. As a consequence, some of the more nuanced aspects of the theories are inevitably simplified. Therefore the reader is strongly encouraged to read the additional recommended literature to get a fuller understanding of each perspective...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the context}} of philosophy, a {{significant}} literature has accumulated that characterises the ostensible goals of education in socio-political terms. Much of this discussion has certainly centred {{on the work of}} political philosophers such as, John Rawls, whose commitment to liberalism has been translated educationally into a rich and varied discourse about the role played by schools in producing ‘good citizens’. Given the multicultural societies in which many of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live,</b> the question naturally arises as to exactly how tolerant a liberal society and the schools that express its values can be, not only in encouraging but in sustaining cultural and religious perspectives that directly or indirectly collide. Our aim in this chapter is to suggest that the debates that have arisen out of this context can be better understood, and made more amenable to resolution, when the covert values that shape and inform the more comprehensive educational epistemology of our schools are made explicit. When such values are made explicit, it will become clearer that the hope of authentic tolerance in a multicultural society cannot be achieved, if the very concept of knowledge that dominates the curriculum of our schools is driven at a deeper level by the preoccupation we have as a putatively ‘liberal culture’ with power. We shall argue here that power is, in its own right, a defining condition of social identity whose importance has not been sufficiently acknowledged within the current debate on multiculturalism and socio-religious tolerance. We shall now turn directly to the task we have set for ourselves...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{the view}} that coming into {{existence}} is bad for us. Can we hold this and yet deny that ceasing to exist {{would be good for}} us? I argue that we can.

Third, even if persons and babies are not distinct things – rather they are phases that human beings go through – still it is bad for babies that they come into existence. So it was bad for us to come into existence. But most of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> enjoy worthwhile <b>lives.</b> So it would be bad for <b>us,</b> <b>now,</b> to cease to exist...|$|R

40|$|The {{way we live}} is {{designed}} by the material world that we designed: a world we were born into and {{which is the only}} one we know (Fry 2008). However, {{it is now clear that}} in order to tackle unprecedented challenges, that very world and our interactions with it need to be questioned and radically redesigned, particularly in cities, where most of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live.</b> Utopian thinking in a time when urgent action is needed might seem indulgent, but I argue it is an effective way to explore new optimistic possibilities for our daily life (and go beyond what we are familiar with), generate ideas, and most importantly map values and priorities. In design, this is known as a divergent step of the process, in which we create choices; it sets the scene for subsequent convergent moments, in which choices are made. A key aspect of divergence is that disagreements and contradictions are allowed and brave ideas are encouraged. As a designer, I am interested in creating platforms enabling this involvement in envisioning divergent utopias. Some of the key issues I am exploring in my research include: what are the conditions that need to be in place, and “how much” should we design? Who are the possible actors in this process? How best to capture the conversations in order for these utopias to become generative tools? In this presentation I will show some examples of creative conversations in which participants reflect on the future by envisioning imaginary cities and communities. In describing each example I will unpick the processes and techniques that are used and what they can afford. Finally, I will outline how I am applying this approach and some of the principles described in the examples to ongoing activities of design research and practice...|$|R
40|$|As I {{thought of}} what I might say to {{introduce}} a Forum calling for diverse voices and alternative rationalities in organizational communication research, I found myself reflecting on my own experience as an organizational communication scholar. For the past 20 -some years, I have worked as a faculty member in five very different communication departments in five different colleges, in five different universities in the Southwest and Midwest United States. Based on what feels like a rather broad range of experience (at least here in the United States), it is hard sometimes to understand myself {{as part of a}} field with substantial disciplinary power. In at least two of my academic “homes,” my colleagues and I engaged in ongoing struggles to sustain ourselves, our courses, and our programs. As I reflect on those experiences now, I sometimes think that if it weren’t for the quality and the nature of our ideas, the field of organizational communication might not have grown to be much of a presence here in the United States. To be sure, there always has been and most likely always will be some interest in the use of communication as a management or business “tool,” but such an understanding of communication alone would not have been sufficient to inspire the growth of an entire field of organizational communication. The field’s growth instead has come at least in part from a great deal of reflexivity about what matters most about communicating and organizing and how that continues to change across space and time. In what follows, Kirsten Broadfoot, Debashish Munshi, Dennis Mumby, and Cynthia Stohl begin a conversation that in various ways calls for expanding the field’s boundaries to include diverse voices and alternative rationalities. Such calls for additional pluralism in organizational communication research have become a hallmark of the field’s development and, once realized, a source of its strength. Please <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>now</b> in considering the difference that diverse voices and alternative rationalities can make to the study and practice of organizational communication...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{planning}} typically enjoys {{success in}} natural settings, {{but the real}} challenge for developing sustainable cities is ensuring ecosystem integrity within urban contexts. Naturally-determined ecosystems have been irrevocably altered by human activity. Indeed, the greatest ongoing problem in planning involves designing within human-dominated ecosystems. After all, 80 % of the <b>US</b> population <b>now</b> <b>lives</b> in urban areas. Low Impact Development: A Design Manual for Urban Areas introduces general audiences to designing landscapes for urban stormwater runoff—a primary source of watershed pollution. This manual can be reviewed episodically, much like a lifestyle publication, or read in its entirety for a comprehensive understanding. The goal is to motivate awareness and implementation of LID in a wide cross-section of stakeholders, from property owners to municipal governments that regulate infrastructure development. Though not exhaustive in its coverage of LID techniques (i. e., {{you will not be}} able to engineer a LID project from this manual), this manual does provide a holistic framework in which a novice homeowner and an experienced developer can each find an equally transformative role to enact.
