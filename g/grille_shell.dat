25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective <b>grille</b> <b>shell</b> and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2010, {{more than}} a year after the SLR was discontinued, McLaren {{announced}} a final body conversion of the supercar. [...] The 25-unit limited McLaren Edition is based on any earlier variant of the SLR besides the Stirling Moss and includes revised bodywork (front and rear bumper, <b>grille,</b> top <b>shell,</b> side gills, rear diffuser, rims) and interior parts, along with upgraded steering and suspension components and a new sports exhaust.|$|R
50|$|The Twenty 70 {{announced}} in mid-September 1933 remains all-steel and now more streamlined. It {{has been given}} an outswept long-skirted tail {{in place of the}} former D-shape. There are separate chairs in front except on the Family saloon which has a three-seater single-piece bench seat at the front. Triplex safety glass is now throughout the car. There are dual screenwipers, a roof lamp, a rear blind which may be controlled from the driver's seat, locks on all doors and a driving mirror. A special design of bumpers is standard throughout the range. De luxe saloons have a sunshine roof, ash trays, cigar lighter, a parcel net on the ceiling and pillar pulls. A luggage grid was also fitted at the back of de luxe saloons.The radiator <b>grille</b> or <b>shell</b> stylishly slopes back to match the new streamlined coachwork and its chromium-plated shutters are thermostatically controlled.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992 {{models were}} similar to 1991s - {{the only way to}} tell the {{difference}} is the rear back glass (the rear glass does not have any trim to which two black buttons serve as the back glass strut mounting points) and front <b>grille</b> (chrome <b>shell</b> with argent silver inserts). The interior was a carryover from 1991 {{with the exception of the}} center console and steering wheel (X-bar style similar to the one used in the GMT400 trucks). Also, the [...] "S-15" [...] name was dropped from the Jimmy. The S10 Blazer also introduced an upscale Tahoe trim package, the Tahoe LT, which was rebadged as the LT in 1995 whilst the Tahoe package was renamed as the LS. The Tahoe LT had its own exterior décor with faded lower body lines on the lower rockers along with Tahoe LT badges - this also included an overhead console and keyless remote door locks). 1992 was the first model year where the S10 Blazer and Jimmy offered an NP233 electronic transfer case for as a drive train option. This deleted the Manual gear range selector with a 3 position switch located to the left of the gauge cluster in the same location that the rear defrost button would be located on non-electronic transfer-case and 2WD model Blazers and Jimmies (when optioned with the electronic transfer case the defrost button assembly is positioned below the headlight switch). The electronic transfer-case added luxury however there was no neutral position with the electronic transfer case, so the owner's manual stated that the drive shaft had to be removed when the vehicle was being towed. The fuel lines, which were routed on the driver side frame rail to the TBI fuel injectors, were redesigned where the fuel inlets entered the rear of the engine (same as the GMT400). This was phased in because of the L35 option which used a similar fuel line setup. The serpentine accessory drive for the 4.3L motor was modified where the air pump was eliminated and further lightened.|$|R

50|$|There are {{subtle changes}} to the {{headlights}} and the bonnet. The V-shaped <b>grille</b> <b>shell</b> is less pronounced and the bumper is rounder and projects 80 mm further forward, but the six-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels or optional 18-inch alloy wheels are the biggest change.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{was painted}} Swedish White Pearl with purple and gold scallops, {{matching}} the body. All the chrome {{work on the}} underside was done by Gejeian's friend, Bob Martin, at his Fresno shop for free, {{in exchange for the}} publicity for Fresno Chrome Plating. Body modifications (except the <b>grille</b> <b>shell,</b> which was aluminum) were done entirely in 20gauge steel.|$|E

5000|$|S.A. des Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville {{was formed}} in 1903 by Louis Delaunay and [...] Barbarou's family owned the boiler making company St. Denis in Belleville, with boiler design {{influences}} inspired by the company. Barbarou, then 28, had experience working for Clément, Lorraine-Dietrich and Benz and was responsible for design and styling, including the trademark round <b>grille</b> <b>shell.</b> The first car was exhibited at the 1904 Paris Salon, and it received enormous acclaim.|$|E
50|$|In this {{installation}} method, the billet grille simply bolts {{over the}} existing OEM plastic grille. This method {{does not require}} drilling or cutting of the OEM <b>grille</b> <b>shell.</b> Hidden bolts, brackets and clamps are used for this simple installation. The downside is it may not look as clean as the replacement style, because {{you can still see}} the OEM grille underneath. Bolt overs should take no more than 30 minutes to install.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{movement}} itself is a little easier to pin down. In 1987, after many decades of building hot rods and customs, Jim [...] "Jake" [...] Jacobs gathered spare parts from his amassed personal stash and put together a ’28 Ford Phaeton in 28 days. It sported no fenders, wide-white bias-ply tires, a rusty Model A body on ’32 Ford frame rails, a chopped windshield and a shortened deuce <b>grille</b> <b>shell</b> with a small-block Chevy 350 and a ’39 Ford 3-speed.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1964 model year, the GT {{saw some}} {{extensive}} design changes. Tooling money was finally appropriated {{to eliminate the}} grooved trunk lid that had required the 1962-63 Hawks' faux rear [...] "grille." [...] The new, smooth trunklid bore a script [...] "Studebaker Hawk" [...] nameplate. Another grille change was made, this time with two new features: A Hawk emblem was centered in the grille, and a circle-S hood ornament (shared with the regular '64 Studebaker passenger cars) graced {{the top of the}} <b>grille</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The '29's {{body was}} given a '27 Ford {{roadster}} back section. The stock fenders were reshaped, [...] "peaked and bobbed using half-inch round rod". A new <b>grille</b> <b>shell</b> was fabricated from steel and filled with clear plastic tubing; it {{was given a}} forward rake. A three-piece hood was made created from aluminum, while louvered steel splash aprons were mounted. The bed was scratchbuilt from steel, with candy gold inserts(found by Barris at a hardware store) and chrome strips. The quadruple headlights, vertically stacked in pairs, were from a '57 Chrysler. The front bumper {{was a pair of}} nerf bars. Taillights were '56 DeSoto lenses in '58 Impala bezels, protected by hairpins. Painted overall in Swedish White Pearl with candy gold scallops, striping was done by master pinstriper Dean Jeffries (early in his career).|$|E
