This is a pre-primary and primary state school with all learners at risk of exclusion and very high numbers from the gypsy community. The teachers fostered the change and considered learning communities {{to be a key}} concept in providing quality education and to break the circle of poverty and social exclusion. These are realised through such activities and approaches as: weekly tutorship; students ’ representative meetings; discussion on the subjects for project work; the monthly family assembly; and the assessment tool elaborated by staff together with the ements and obstacles while also guiding improvements. A key feature are interactive groups based on cooperative periods of 15 - 20 minutes, each devoted to a d dynamics coordinated by volunteers from families, the university, and collaborating associations.

40|$|The {{problem of}} early identification, {{training}} and education {{of gifted and talented}} children is becoming more prevalent today. Theoretical and practical issues, possibilities and forms of work with them in recent years {{have been the subject of}} research worldwide. For elementary school students this period is most suitable for the detection of talents and of identifying, targeting and developing potential opportunities. Thus it is necessary to find all the possibilities and forms of additional work with gifted students: enrollment of students in the first grade, working with gifted students within the regular curriculum, structuring of differentiated (developmental) <b>grades</b> <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> within the <b>grade,</b> based on capabilities at three levels, forming partly homogeneous groups of gifted students, accelerated advancement, school acceleration, individualisation and differentiation of teaching, leisure activities (sections), additional work with gifted students, using modern technical means, above all, computers and tablets.

40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{the study}} was to clarify the impact of post-procedural aortic {{regurgitation}} (post-AR) grade 2 / 4 on clinical outcomes. BackgroundPost-AR > 2 / 4 is known to be associated with poor short- to midterm outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). MethodsWe compared clinical outcomes in 400 consecutive TAVI recipients according to post-AR grade: <b>grade</b> 0 <b>or</b> 1 (<b>group</b> 1 = 74. 8 %), grade 2 (group 2 = 22. 2 %), <b>or</b> <b>grade</b> 3 <b>or</b> 4 (<b>group</b> 3 = 3. 0 %). ResultsThe mean age was similar in the 3 groups (83. 4 ± 6. 1 years) as was the logistic EuroSCORE (22. 5 ± 11. 4 %, 24. 5 ± 11. 6 %, and 21. 5 ± 9. 4 %, p = 0. 28) and annulus size (22. 0 ± 1. 8, 22. 2 ± 2. 1, and 22. 5 ± 2. 1 mm, p = 0. 53). The Edwards valve was most frequently used in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (89. 3 %, 78. 7 %, and 83. 3 %, p = 0. 03), and the implanted valve size was similar in all groups (25. 6 ± 2. 0, 25. 4 ± 2. 2, and 25. 5 ± 2. 2 mm, respectively, p = 0. 69). Post-dilation was required more frequently in group 3 (4. 7 %, 24. 1 %, and 50. 0 %, respectively, p < 0. 01). Post-procedural increase in mitral regurgitation was in line with the post-AR grade (0. 78 ± 0. 73, 1. 22 ± 0. 80, and 1. 89 ± 0. 78, respectively, p < 0. 01). Despite the absence of difference in 30 -day mortality, longer-term outcome was significantly poorer in patients with AR grade 2 than in those with AR <b>grade</b> 0 <b>or</b> 1 (log-rank p < 0. 01), albeit better than in patients with AR <b>grade</b> 3 <b>or</b> 4 (p = 0. 04), regardless of TAVI type and left ventricular function. Post-AR ≥ 2 / 4 was also identified as an independent predictor of mid- to long-term mortality (hazard ratio: 1. 68, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 21 to 1. 44, p < 0. 01). ConclusionsPost-AR grade 2 / 4 after TAVI is associated with worse outcome compared with <b>grade</b> 0 <b>or</b> 1. Careful valve selection and post-dilation when required to avoid post-AR grade 2 may contribute to improved clinical outcome after TAVI...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} 372 third, {{fourth and fifth}} grade students, {{identified}} as living in single-parent homes, were selected from six elementary schools designated as having high mobility indexes. The sample was studied {{to determine the effect}} of student transfer on mathematics and reading achievement. The information collected for statistical analysis was sex, grade, ability, mobility, mathematics achievement and reading achievement. The sample students were grouped as either high mobile, average mobile, low mobile or nonmobile according to the number of school transfers. ^ Data analysis indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in the mean mathematics achievement scores between mobility <b>groups,</b> sexual <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> <b>grade</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition, there was not a significant interaction of mobility with the independent variables, ability, sex and grade in relation to mathematics achievement. ^ Data analysis of reading achievement scores revealed no statistically significant difference between mobility <b>groups,</b> sexual <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> <b>grade</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition, there was not a significant interaction of mobility with the independent variables, ability, sex, <b>or</b> <b>grade</b> in the analysis of reading achievement scores. ^ There did exist a statistically significant difference in the mean mathematic achievement scores and the mean reading achievement scores between ability groups. Higher ability students scored higher in both reading and mathematics than did the lower ability students. ^ The results of this research tended to support the theory that mobility or student transfer has no effect on mathematics and reading achievement. The study 2 ̆ 7 s results supported the hypothesis that the degree of mobility {{did not appear to be}} an additional factor causing a detrimental nor a beneficial influence on the mathematics and reading achievement of students who had experienced the separation or loss of a parent. ^ The results of this study supported the recommendation that educators no longer excuse or ignore a student 2 ̆ 7 s poor academic performance upon the sole basis of a history of frequent school transfer. However, the results indicate the need for further empirical investigation of the relationship of student transfer, single-parenting, and academic achievement. ...|$|R
5000|$|Hurricane Fly (foaled 5 April 2004) is {{a retired}} Irish Thoroughbred racehorse {{best known for his}} {{performances}} in hurdle races with trainer Willie Mullins at Closutton Co. Carlow in Ireland. He is a dual winner of the Champion Hurdle and holds the world record for most <b>Grade</b> 1 (<b>or</b> <b>Group</b> 1) races won by any racehorse. Originally bred to be a flat racer, the gelding began his racing career in France where he had moderate success, winning twice in ten races. At the end of 2007 he was sold and transferred to Ireland where he began to compete in National Hunt events. On 15 March 2011, Hurricane Fly ridden by Ruby Walsh won the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. After finishing third 2012 he became the first horse in thirty-eight years to regain the Champion Hurdle title by winning the race for a second time in 2013. On 26 April 2013 he had his 16th Grade 1victory at the Punchestown Champion Hurdle equaling the record for Grade 1 wins held by Kauto Star and John Henry. He took sole possession of the record when winning the Morgiana Hurdle on 17 November 2013. He added a further five wins at the highest level before being retired in August 2015.|$|R
40|$|Obesity-related glomerulopathy is an {{established}} secondary glomerular disease {{that may occur}} in obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m 2. However, patients with moderate obesity (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m 2) may also develop this disease. Methods: A total of 20 patients with grade 1 obesity (25  ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m 2) with persistent proteinuria, without evidence of other renal diseases, were analyzed retrospectively. These patients were compared with 20 patients with <b>grade</b> 2 <b>or</b> higher obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) with persistent proteinuria. Biopsies of 31 kidney transplant donors as healthy controls were used to compare histologic parameters. Results: Similar to the <b>grade</b> 2 <b>or</b> higher obesity <b>group,</b> the grade 1 obesity group had a male predominance (85 %) and showed {{a high incidence of}} hypertension (80 %). Urinary protein excretion and renal outcome parameters were comparable between the groups. Patients with grade 1 obesity showed typical histologic features of obesity-related glomerulopathy: low glomerular density with glomerulomegaly. The glomerular density and mean glomerular volume in the grade 1 <b>group,</b> the <b>grade</b> 2 <b>or</b> higher <b>group,</b> and the kidney transplant donors with grade 1 obesity were 1. 6 ± 0. 8 versus 1. 4 ± 0. 6 versus 3. 0 ± 1. 1 (per mm 2) and 6. 1 ± 2. 1 versus 6. 4  ±  1. 6 versus 2. 9 ± 0. 8 (× 106 μm 3), respectively. Discussion: A glomerulopathy similar to obesity-related glomerulopathy can occur in moderately obese individuals.

40|$|While {{there are}} {{different}} names and forms of multi-age classrooms, the essential concept involves combining different <b>grade</b> levels <b>or</b> age <b>groups</b> within one classroom. The most common form is a split grade in an elementary school which is taught by one teacher for {{all or most of}} the time. Split-grade classes usually consist of students from two sequential grades within one classroom, for example Grade 2 / 3 <b>or</b> <b>Grade</b> 4 / 5, or some other combination. Splitgrade classrooms are one type of configuration within multi-age classrooms, which might include children with a range of ages, going as far as the one-room K- 12 school. There are two reasons why multi-age classes exist: one reflects a philosophy; the second relates to administrative considerations. The philosophy that students benefit from the range and diversity possible with multi-age groupings is reflected in the work of Gaustad (1997), who argued that: “Research indicates that heterogeneous grouping promotes cognitive and social growth, reduces anti-social behaviour, and facilitates the use of research-based developmentally appropriate instructional practices such as active learning and integrated curriculum. The wider range of ages and abilities in a multi-ag...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of steady, graded, and no exercise on stress reduction, and the effects of self-confidence on stress reduction through exercise. Seventy-two male and female volunteers from the Portland area, ranging in age from 19 - 49 years, served as subjects. Subjects completed pre and post measures of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and the state portion of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Subjects were divided into two experimental and one control group matched according to age and exercise history. The control group kept its exercise at a minimum for eight weeks. Exercise programs for the two experimental groups consisted of twelve minute work bouts on ergometers three times per week, for eight weeks. Work bouts were at a seventy percent maximum heart rate. Due to attrition and a random drop of subjects in the control group, thirty-one subjects remained. Analyses found a significant stress reduction for the steady exercise group (t = - 2. 81,p =. 017), but not for the <b>graded</b> <b>or</b> no exercise <b>group.</b> Stress reduction was negatively correlated with self-confidence, though not significantly, and {{no significant differences were found}} between the self-confidence scores.

25|$|In {{the autumn}} term of 1949, some Swedish school districts {{introduced}} an experiment with a nine-year school called enhetsskola. The enhetsskola had three stages. The first 3 years were lågstadium (lower stage), {{the next three}} years were mellanstadium (middle stage) and the last three years were högstadium (upper stage). In those school districts, småskola became lågstadium, folkskola became mellanstadium and realskola became högstadium. On 26 May 1950 the Swedish parliament decided to introduce the enhetsskola in Sweden. In 1958 the enhetsskola became försöksskola, which in 1962 changed name to grundskola. By 1972, the grundskola had been introduced in all parts in Sweden, replacing the folkskola and högre allmänna läroverket. From the autumn term of 1994, the official division in three different stages was abolished. In the early 1990s, Sweden also introduced förskoleklass for the children aged 6, a one-year-long grade which first was called årskurs 0 (<b>Grade</b> 0) <b>or</b> 6-årsgrupp (<b>group</b> for the six-year-olds). Förskoleklass, which officially became the name from the 1998-1999 school year, is not mandatory.|$|R

It is shown that such relations depend only on the requirement (i) that the multiplet of vector fields form an irreducible representation of the unifying algebra and (ii) the transformation properties of the fermions under SU L (2). This point is illustrated in two ways, one by constructing two different unification groups containing the same fermions and therefore have same Weinberg angle; the other by putting different SU L (2) structures on the same fermions and consequently have different Weinberg angles. In particular the value sin~ 0 = 3 / 8 is characteristic of the sequential doublet models or models which invoke {{a large number of}} additional leptons like E 6, while addition of extra charged fermion singlets can reduce the value of sin ~ 0 to 1 / 4.
