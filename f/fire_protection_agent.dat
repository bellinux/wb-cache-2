40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{improvement}} of a combined impregnation process (CIP, {{also known as the}} Royal process). This treatment combines the protective properties of a wood protection agent and the hydrophobic properties of a subsequent oil treatment in a wood product. Copper-based wood preservatives, which are traditionally used in CIP, are very effective but their long-term future use is questionable because of environmental concerns, especially the toxicity against water-living organisms. There is a need for new environmentally friendly wood preservative systems for a use in CIP. The substitutes for copper used in this study are natural polymers and organic biocides. The aim of this research is to describe the fixation effectiveness of the following compounds: Chitosan, Propiconazole, Wolmanit CX- 8, Tannin, <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> <b>agent,</b> Alginate. The scots pine sapwood samples (50 ´ 25 ´ 15)  mm were impregnated and oil treated. The treated products were analysed for their preservative-and oil-retention. Preservative fixation time influence on oil treatment was tested. The treated samples were leached according to EN 84. Water samples were analyzed for the amount of active ingredient.

30|$|At all sites, BDE- 47 was the {{dominant}} congener with 60 % to 62 % {{at the two}} sites at the Rhine and 74 % in the Lippe. BDE- 100 was present with 28 % to 30 % in the Rhine and 17 % in the Lippe. The other congeners were present in minor concentrations. A similar congener pattern with BDE- 47 dominating and BDE- 100 as {{the second most important}} congener was reported from the eel populations from the Scheldt [38], from the Elbe [49] and by Sühring et al. [50] for eel populations from several European rivers. In contrast, Sühring et al. [50] found equal concentrations of BDE- 47 and BDE- 100 in yellow eels from North America. They related this difference to the continuous exposition of American eels to technical penta- and octa-PBDE mixtures which had been banned in Europe in 2004. In contrast to the biota PBDE pattern, the Rhine suspended matter comprised almost exclusively of BDE- 209 (95 % to 97 %), reflecting the continuous use of deca-BDE as <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> <b>agent</b> in consumer goods. In the suspended matter of the Lippe, BDE- 209 accounted for only 25 %, and BDE- 99 and BDE- 47 were present with 35 % and 24 %, respectively. This conspicuous PBDE pattern, which can be related to the influence of local chemical industry, did not lead to a change in the PBDE pattern in eels. Roosens et al. [51] investigated PBDE patterns in eels and in the sediment from various locations in Flemish water bodies. They also found high BDE- 209 concentrations in the sediment and only rarely found elevated BDE- 209 concentrations in eels. They attributed this discrepancy to a poor uptake of BDE- 209 from the sediment, a low solubility in water and a high degradation in the fish. The debromination of BDE- 209 to lower brominated congeners has been described by several authors, e. g. [40],[52]-[54] and seems to be a major source of penta-PBDEs in fish.|$|E

40|$|Incipient fires {{typically}} occur {{after the}} partial premixing {{of fuel and}} oxidizer. The mixing of product species into the fuel/oxidizer mixture influences flame stabilization and fire spread. Therefore, {{it is important to}} characterize the impact of different levels of fuel/oxidizer/product mixing on flame stabilization, liftoff and extinguishment under different gravity conditions. With regard to <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> the <b>agent</b> concentration required to achieve flame suppression is an important consideration. The initial stage of an unwanted fire in a microgravity environment will depend on the level of partial premixing and the local conditions such as air currents generated by the fire itself and any forced ventilation (that influence agent and product mixing into the fire).

40|$|Children’s need of {{assistance}} during {{the evacuation of}} a preschool is taken for granted when planning for fire safety. This calls for comprehensive technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> mesures. The aim of this report is to examine child behavior in a situation requiring evacuation and it’s implications for organizational and technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> To answer this question three areas of focus have been established; technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at preschools and child behavior during evacuation. Technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated according to the written rules and recommendations. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated at four preschools according to Brandkompetensutvecklingsschema, BUS, which describes the level of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> awareness of an organization. Child behavior during an evacuation has been examined through studies of relevant literature. Two studies of evacuation, one from Denmark and one from Russia, that consider child behavior are referred to. In Sweden the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is planned according to laws and regulations, among other Plan och Bygglagen and Boverkets byggregler for which preschools place specific requirements. The most significant difference in planning of building <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at a preschool {{is that it is}} assumed the children need help during evacuation. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is regulated by the Law Lagen om skydd mot olyckor, that requires preschools to work systematically with <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and have sufficient documentation ensuring that reasonable <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures are taken and maintained in a functional state. Child behavior during evacuation differs from that of adults in movement patterns, speed of gait, preparation time and need for physical and verbal help. In three of the BUS-evaluated preschools we saw {{that when it comes to}} systematic work for <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> the technical aspects are in focus and some anxiety was registered about conducting evacuation exercises with the children. One preschool indicated a very developed level of organization regarding <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> This preschool regularly conducted evacuation exercises and responded positively. There are many things to take into account when planning for a preschool build. How child behavior differs from adult behavior needs to be considered in both the technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> The contractor needs to understand the importance organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and the user of the building needs to understand how the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is intended to work. It is also important for the building user to prioritize correctly; the user should not only focus on the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures but also must understand the importance of systematic fire preventive actions.
