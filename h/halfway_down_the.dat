5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba {{was greeted}} by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was about <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several town walls around Edinburgh, Scotland, since the 12th century. Some form of wall {{probably}} existed from {{the foundation of the}} royal burgh in around 1125, though the first building is recorded in the mid-15th century, when the King's Wall was constructed. In the 16th century the more extensive Flodden Wall was erected, following the Scots' defeat at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. This was extended by the Telfer Wall in the early 17th century. The walls had a number of gates, known as ports, the most important being the Netherbow Port, which stood <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Royal Mile. This gave access from the Canongate which was, at that time, a separate burgh.|$|E

5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> side of the fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on Chamaecytisus austriacus. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a very narrow gallery {{descending}} along the leaf margin until about <b>halfway</b> <b>down.</b> Then <b>the</b> corridor widens into a blotch that eventually becomes full depth and occupies the entire leaflet. The frass is deposited in a central accumulation. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.|$|R

25|$|The {{length of}} an indoor cricket pitch {{is the same}} as a {{conventional}} cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting. Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the batsmen do not have to run the entire length. The striker's crease is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bell}} rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed {{over to the}} rail position. <b>Halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, {{gradually}} pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two {{hundred yards from the}} wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral's running his best time for the distance.|$|E
25|$|Race {{fourteen}} {{was another}} {{end to end}} win by Oracle. Starting in the leeward position, Spithill again luffed Barker hard substantially past the reach mark. This set up a strong lead for the first downwind beat. On the upwind leg Team New Zealand were able to close, {{and at one point}} had to dip under the American boat. They could not press the advantage however, and Oracle led well around the top mark. Team New Zealand once again closed right up to the American boat about <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> fourth leg, but could not make the pass. Oracle closed out the win by 23 seconds to bring the score to 4–8.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1915–16 the 1/7th Londons carried out regular tours of duty in the Loos sector. losing {{a steady stream of}} {{casualties}} to artillery and mine attacks. In March 1916 the 47th Division took over part of the Vimy sector {{on the west side of}} the Vimy Ridge. On 21 May 140 Bde (temporarily under the command of Col Faux of the 1/7th) was subjected to a heavy bombardment, and the Germans attacked in the evening. The weight of the attack fell on 1/7th and 1/8th Londons, who were forced back from their front and support lines <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope. 1/7th made a local counter-attack, but it was too weak to succeed. After a night and day of confusion, the 1/6th and 1/7th Bns pushed forward 250 yards to reoccupy an old French trench which they consolidated and thereby prevented any further enemy advance. They were relieved in the evening of 22 May, having suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|However, the Duke of Perth {{seems to}} have misinterpreted Murray's actions as only a general advance, and the Macdonalds {{on the far left}} simply ignored him. The result was the skewing of the Jacobite front line, with the (left wing) Macdonalds still rooted on the Culloden Parks wall and the (right wing) Atholl Brigade <b>halfway</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Culwhiniac Parks wall. In consequence, large gaps {{immediately}} appeared in the severely over-stretched Jacobite lines. A shocked Sullivan {{had no choice but to}} position the meagre 'second line' to fill the gaps. This second line was (left to right): the Irish Picquets; the Duke of Perth's Regiment; Glenbuchat's; Lord Kilmarnock's Footguards; John Roy Stuart's Regiment; two battalions of Lord Ogilvy's Regiment; the Royal Écossais; two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's Regiment. Farther back were cavalry units. On the left were: Lord Strathallan's Horse Bagot's Hussars and possibly Balmerino's Lifeguards. On the right were Lord Elcho's Lifeguards and Fitzjames's Horse. And in the centre was Charles Edward Stuart's tiny escort made up of Fitzjames's Horse and Lifeguards. When Sullivan's redeployment was completed Perth's and Glenbuchat's regiments were standing on the extreme left wing and John Roy Stuart's was standing beside Ardsheal's.|$|E
