However, fewaccurate data sources are available for documenting long-termvegetation changes. In this paper, we describe a neglected source of quantitative information on historical forest structure: forest inventory strip surveys,which were widely used in eastern Australia from 1915 to the 1940 s. Strip surveys provide quantitative information on the species composition, stemdensity, basal area, stem formand size class distributions of dominant tree species. Such information is not available from other widespread data sources. Strip surveys usually surveyed 10 % of the total forest area. In this paper, we describe the original survey methods, demonstrate how to decode <b>data-book</b> entries, and analyse a sample dataset from the Pilliga State Forests in northern New SouthWales to illustrate the {{information that can be}} obtained from this material. Strip survey data-books are poorly archived. Many books exist forEucalyptusâ€“Callitris forests in northern and central NSW, and additional books may exist for many other forest types in eastern Australia. Strip surveys provide a valuable data source for studying long-termvegetation changes in forest ecosystems. Weurge forestmanagers to search for andpreserve this precious archival material...|$|E
40|$|Data Mining is {{the process}} of extracting knowledge, hidden from large volume of raw data. AI is about {{simulating}} human intelligence. The project aims at proving that Data mining methods can be realized in Mechanical Engineering Industries. To prove this we have created a Database containing design elements and have made the process to retrieved design elements as per the requirements. The same when applied to any industry, it can be proved beneficial and also cut down a lot of time wasted due to human in efficiency. This includes several steps: 1. Design a Database which stores data, 2. using asp. net code to retrieve the data, Data mining techniques viable tools for determining interesting patterns, clustering the parameter space, detecting anomalies in the simulation results, and for designing improved physical models. In mechanical industries, this technology can be used for a variety of jobs like forecasting, file management, providing information regarding the availability of material in production processes and also failure analysis in maintainance industries. The project mainly deals with building a huge database, collecting data from <b>data-book,</b> using SQL server 2000. retrieval is done using asp. net programming on WINDOWS 2003 Enterprise Edition platform...|$|E
25|$|As German law gives maximum {{pressures}} for every commercial caliber, the handloader {{is allowed to}} non-commercially give away his ammunition. He is liable for incorrect loading. His references are <b>data-books</b> by propellant manufacturers (like RWS), bullet manufacturers (like Speer), reloading tool manufacturers (like Lyman) or neutral institutions (like the DEVA). Firearms manufacturers give guarantee {{as long as the}} handloaded ammunition is within the correct parameters.|$|R
40|$|Exact {{simulation}} of conducted EMI {{in switched mode}} power supplies is proposed. In order to achieve exact simulations, PSPICE active component ABM model and modified transformer model are proposed. Each model parameter is extracted from measurements and <b>data-books.</b> PSPICE simulation results with high frequency PCB pattern model are accordant with EMI measurements for a 50 [W] isolated flyback converter. EMI relations of each component and EMI patterns are analyzed...|$|R
