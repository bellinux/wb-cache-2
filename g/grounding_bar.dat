There are several ways to calculate the earthing resistance theoretically, but in practice it differs by various factors. In these factors the contact resistance between the earth and the grounding electrode is given much weight. Here it has been assumed that the earthing resistance is composed of one resistance which may be calculated by the resistivity of the ground and of another that may be the contact resistance between the earth and the earthing electrode，and {{in the area of the}} volcanic ashes the contact resistance between the simple <b>grounding</b> <b>bar</b> and the earth has been got experimentaly for the shallow part of the ground. To the ground about one meter deep，it has been concluded that the earthing resistance is composed of the contact resistance between the earth and the earthing bar in the area of the volcanic ashe...|$|E

With copper prices at $3.70 a pound , compared to $0.60 a pound in 2002, people have been increasingly stealing copper wire from telephone and power company assets. Gangs have been created, a black market for copper wire has emerged, and men even have been injured in power plants while trying to obtain copper wire. Other sources of stolen copper include railroad signal lines, <b>grounding</b> <b>bars</b> at electric substations, and even a 3000-pound bell stolen from a Buddhist temple in Tacoma, Washington, which was later recovered.|$|R

30|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the 2002 {{digital television}} (DTV) broadcast demonstration from a solar-powered stratospheric flying wing, a prototype stratospheric airship {{was used for}} a more realistic DTV broadcast demonstration in 2004, albeit at a lower altitude. The DTV signal was occasionally lost at the receiver directly below the airship during the demonstration. Adverse antenna-vehicle integration effects were investigated using a commercially available antenna simulation software, because the radiation pattern of the antenna on the airship could not be measured directly. The <b>ground</b> handling <b>bars</b> on the airship gondola were found to introduce deep and sharp nulls into the radiation pattern of the broadcast antenna.

50|$|The {{elevated}} {{nature of}} the post allows for a safer landing with the heavy load of the prey, {{as well as being}} a good vantage point to scan for other predators, while the bird is vulnerable, involved in the relatively complex process of plucking and feeding upon its prey. Many owls use plucking posts for prey that has been caught on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Barred</b> owls often use old nests for the purpose. Plucking posts are used by barn owls which hunt by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. The barn owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates, particularly rodents. The common buzzard is another user of plucking posts and has an even more varied diet than the barn owl. The sparrowhawk flies low over the ground, skimming hedges and fences, but staying close to cover so that it can rapidly pounce on its victims. In woodland its agility enables it to fly swiftly between the trunks and branches.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Many {{studies in}} the dental {{literature}} look at the effect of different surface treatment methods on the flexure strength of zirconia where polished zirconia {{has been used as}} control. However, zirconia is subjected to different types of surface damage {{as a result of the}} CAD/CAM milling procedure and also to damage produced by other laboratory procedures in use daily. Aim of the work. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different surface treatment methods and in particular the effect of the CAD/CAM milling procedure on the flexure strength of zirconia frameworks. Materials and methods. At least 20 zirconia bars (17 mm× 2 mm× 1 mm) for each group were prepared by either cutting and polishing zirconia milling blocks or by using a CAD/CAM device (Cercon) which left behind characteristic surface features related to the milling process. The fully sintered bars received either of the following surface treatments: air-borne particle abrasion (with 50 and 120 maluminumoxide particles, or both). Some bars received a heat treatment commonly used in baking veneer ceramics before or after particle abrasion. The surface roughness was measured for all bars, which were finally loaded in a three-point device. The fractured bars were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and survivability was estimated using Weibull analysis (˛ < 0. 05). Results. There were significant differences in the flexure strength (in MPa) between the tested groups subjected to different surface treatments which can be categorized into four strength levels: (1074 - 1166 MPa) for polished zirconia and the CAD/CAM bars that were particle abraded (50 mAl 2 O 3) whether with or without heat treatment (936 MPa) for the <b>ground</b> <b>bars</b> that were particle abraded (50 mAl 2 O 3), (708 - 794 MPa) for CAD/CAM bars and for the polished bars that were particle abraded (120 m Al 2 O 3), and (546 MPa) for the <b>ground</b> <b>bars</b> that were particle abraded (120 m Al 2 O 3) being the weakest. There was a strong correlation between flexure strength and the severity of surface damage as indicated by surface roughness (R 2 = 0. 912). Scanning electron microscopy revealed different types of surface and subsurface damage produced by the different surface treatments. Conclusions. The surface damage produced by the CAD/CAM milling procedure significantly reduced the strength of zirconia which could be further weakened by different surface treatment methods resulting in unexpected failures at stresses much lower than the ideal strength of the material. It is advised to consider the effect of the CAD/CAM procedure on the characteristic strength when designing zirconia-based fixed partial dentures...|$|R
