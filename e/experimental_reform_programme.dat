40|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the UK, child care and {{protection}} practice in Scotland has undergone unprecedented change over the last ten years, including a wide-ranging three-year Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme.</b> In 2006, The University of Dundee's Centre for Child Care and Protection and Barnardo's Scotland Research and Development team were commissioned by the then Scottish Executive to undertake a process review of the Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme</b> (Daniel et al., 2007). Drawing on findings from the process review, this article considers the impact of the Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme.</b> The process review concluded that, in the view of the respondents, the Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme</b> made a substantive contribution towards the improvement and delivery of child protection services in Scotland, particularly in terms of raising awareness and increased multi-agency working. It was beyond the scope of the review to measure outcomes for children as a result of the reforms. Since the completion of the Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme,</b> national policy emphasis has broadened from ‘child protection' towards integrated support for children under the Getting it Right for Every Child reforms of children's services. The paper concludes with a discussion around where ‘child protection' now fits within this context of universal support for children and argues that there is a need to ensure that the valuable work which was done to improve child protection services in Scotland under the Child Protection <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme</b> is not lost...|$|R

40|$|The central aim of Deliverable 9. 1 is to {{identify}} possible trends EU member states’ social policies {{in relation to a}} number of important citizenship issues. The broader objective of WP 9 is to study the relationship between the effects of discrepancies between respective civil, political, social, and economic citizenship rights and obligations of European and non-European citizens as family members moving across borders. Within this project, we have identified four themes to focus on: care for the elderly, non-national care workers, the reproductive rights of family members and mobile youth. For this deliverable, we have evaluated (i) the 2013 National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programmes</b> of those 23 member states that had National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programmes</b> available and in the English language (exceptions include France, Portugal and Romania) and (ii) the 2014 National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programmes</b> for Croatia and Ireland who did not have a 2013 document. The analytic perspective used in this evaluation has been the policy-scientific approach of Leeuw (2003). The current deliverable contains a first short description of EU guidelines and a descriptive summary of member state discourses on these four themes. Utrecht University has coordinated the task and one partner has contributed by delivering an analysis of the 2014 Croatian National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme.</b> The working process included several steps: - Desk top research to select relevant themes for the analysis. - Reading and coding all of the Europe 2020 documents and 2013 National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programmes</b> for any information on care for the elderly, non-national care workers, reproductive rights of men and women (including migrants) and mobile youth. - Coding each of these themes into relevant sub-themes related to citizenship rights. - A draft version of this report was discussed at the bEUcitizen conference in Istanbul, Turkey in late June/early July 2014. WP 9 members provided comments on this report at that stage. - Additional data was collected for Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013 and produced its first National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme</b> in 2014. Additional data was collected for Ireland, who had not produced a 2013 National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programme.</b> The 2014 National <b>Reform</b> <b>Programmes</b> of both Croatia and Ireland are included here...|$|R

40|$|Summaries This article {{argues that}} the goals of social justice, poverty {{alleviation}} and gender equality within the post?apartheid government's land <b>reform</b> <b>programme</b> are threatened by government's neo?liberal macroeconomic framework, by shortcomings in addressing gender and because rural women do not constitute an organised social force. The article outlines the key elements of the land <b>reform</b> <b>programme</b> and points to limitations arising from the market?based nature of the land <b>reform</b> <b>programme.</b> The article highlights innovative mechanisms within the programme aimed at involving women in land reform. These include the requirements of women's participation in land <b>reform</b> pilot <b>programme</b> structures and of gender equality within group ownership entities – the ‘Community Property Associations’. However, the overall approach is to target women without adequately considering gender power relations. The article suggests that while the state can {{play a significant role}} in providing an enabling framework, the key to advancing gender equality is women's organisation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the disclosure practices of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) {{and the impact}} of <b>reform</b> <b>programmes</b> in the SOE sector on such practices. The study stems from evidence of poor performance of SOEs attributed to the dearth of information disclosure, hence, the introduction of <b>reform</b> <b>programmes</b> to address these problems. Based on multiple case design with data gathered from three large SOEs and key policy makers in the SOE sector of Ghana, the findings show that the disclosure relationships, objectives, and media are generally the same across all SOEs. There are however some notable variations from the both within-case and cross-case analyses, with respect to the generic sections, volume and disclosure types in their respective annual reports. There are also differences in relation to the processes of producing their disclosure media. With regards to the impact of <b>reform</b> <b>programmes,</b> the study found both sector-wide and industry specific <b>reform</b> <b>programmes,</b> driven and underpinned by institutional forces and tenets of agency theory. These programmes have among other things, increased the numbers of disclosure media, stakeholders or principals that SOEs must disclose to, expanded the nature of disclosure (managerial, program, procedures, and financial) and types of disclosure relationships (diagonal). ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{undertakes}} {{a comparative}} {{analysis of the}} South African labour tenancy contract and the Malawian tenant worker’s contract {{in the context of}} the land law <b>reform</b> <b>programme</b> instituted in both countries. Historically, both contracts represent mechanisms for access to otherwise inaccessible land. They have been devoid of proprietary rights and secure tenure. However, South Africa, through its land <b>reform</b> <b>programme,</b> has adopted a robust approach towards the infusion of proprietary rights and secure tenure into the labour tenancy contract. The South African approach adjusts ‘the relative positions’ of the farmland owner and the labour tenant, as it moves away from a permits- or personal-rights-based approach to a proprietary, in rem (real) rights approach to land access. Malawi’s land <b>reform</b> <b>programme</b> does not include similar provisions for the tenant worker’s contract. Malawi’s land law reform must undertake similar corrective and appropriate action. ...|$|R
