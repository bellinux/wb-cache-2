Its geographic boundaries are clearly defined: on the south Cape Hatteras, the most easterly seaward projection of the North Carolina shore; on the north Cape Cod. Biologically, the fauna of this long, curving Middle Atlantic shore is distinct {{from that of the}} North and South Atlantic coasts. Cape Hatteras and Cape Cod are natural boundaries of the marine world. There is some straying beyond them, some overlapping of ranges, {{but for the most part}} the truly southern, tropical or semi-tropical fishes live belo-v Hatteras, the typically cold water fishes beyond and north of Cape Cod. Most characteristic of the Middle Atlantic fauna is a group of 60 or more species collectively known as shore fishes. They are a migratory group, their migrations are seasonal, and for generations their movements have determined the character of the fisheries of the region. In the spring and summer, shorefish move in to coastal waters, including bays, sounds, sometimes river estuaries. They tend to be more concentrated at this season toward the northern part of their range. In the fall and early winter they migrate to offshore more southerly wintering grounds. Formerly the shorefish were taken only during the spring, summer, and fall, when on the inshore grounds. No one knew exactly where the fish went in winter, nor how to follow and capture them. About 1930, however, the offshore winter home of the shorefish was discovered; gear and vessels were developed which were suitable for fishing these grounds in stormy winter weather. Now intensive winter fisheries have grown up, working the offshore area from about 80 miles off New York City all the way to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, and shorefishes come into the markets throughout the year. While the shorefishes are most typical of the Middle Atlantic fauna, they are not the most valuable aquatic resource of the region. This distinction falls to oysters, the product for which the region is best and most widely known. Since the earliest beginnings of the oyster industry, the Chesapeake Bay has held first rank as a producer of oysters. The area as a whole now provides more than half of all the oyster harvest taken in United States waters, and its fishermen receive approximately eight million dollars for this single aquatic crop. (Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s income from all Middle Atlantic fishery products: about 22 million dollars.) Other special resources give the Middle Atlantic region a unique position as a source of aquatic foods. Nearly two-thirds of the catch of 2 ̆ 7 Atlantic coast crabs is taken in this area, mostly in Chesapeake Bay. Receiving the drainage of the mightiest rivers of the Atlantic coast [...] the Hudson, the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac [...] the Middle Atlantic region is the center of the fisheries for shad and river herring, species which live most of their lives in the sea, but enter fresh water to spawn. The area provides more than half the total catch of menhaden, first ranking Atlantic coast fish in volume of production. Its waters yield the first mackerel, swordfish, and tuna of the season. since each of these oceanic wanderers enters coastal waters north of Hatteras as it turns shoreward in spring. 36 pages, with maps 2 ̆ 6 illustrations.

40|$|Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) is an {{infectious}} disease {{spread through the}} oral-fecal route. Approximately 180, 000 Americans acquire hepatitis A infection each year, costing $ 1, 817 - $ 2, 459 per symptomatic case. HAV environmental surveillance in remote locations requires inexpensive, flexible, and sensitive molecular detection methods. Since the virus is endemic among many rural Native American subpopulations, adapting a new method for sustainable rural HAV detection could greatly benefit these high risk areas. This project established a portable HAV reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay for environmental surveillance from water, sewage, or clam tissue. Mercenaria mercenaria (<b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> <b>clams)</b> concentrate the virus through filter-feeding, providing a natural environmental sentinel for detection. The technique could detect as few as 30 - 100 PFU HAV per liter of water, 1 PFU per 10 mL of urea-arginine phosphate buffer, and 0. 3 PFU HAV per 2 mL of guanidium isothiocyanate solution. Clam dissection utilized compartmentalized bivalve physiology to isolate tissues more likely to contain HAV. Environmental detection on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation (Northern California) pinpointed a 1 L water sample with at least 30 PFU of HAV in a localized area of the reservation. Sequencing of the amplicon was consistent with a 1 B genotype of HAV, supporting epidemiological evidence.

40|$|The European green crab, Carcinus maenas, {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} invasive species in coastal systems. This species has become established on five continents and has produced significant negative ecological and economic impacts in many areas. On the Atlantic coast of North America, green crabs have been established for at least 180 years. On the Pacific coast, green crabs became established in San Francisco Bay in the late 1980 s and expanded their range rapidly during the 1990 s. In response to the spread and impacts of green crabs in the U. S., Carcinus maenas was listed as an aquatic nuisance species by the federal Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF). To date, there have been no formal review of the ecological impacts of green crabs and no formal attempts to quantify and understand their potential economic impacts. This paper presents a predictive framework for understanding the magnitude and extent of green crab impacts on the East and West Coasts of the U. S. The framework consists of several linked models. The ecological sub-models incorporate green crab dispersal and relationship between green crab abundance and the dynamics of prey populations. The economic analysis focuses on the green crab impacts on commercial shellfisheries and estuarine restoration efforts. The documented historical and present impacts of green crabs on the shellfishery include soft-shell clams, blue mussels, scallops, <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> <b>clam,</b> and manila clams. The preliminary results of this analysis show that damages to commercial shellfishery from Green Crab predation are on average $ 22. 6 million per year on the East Coast of the United States.

40|$|Increased {{anthropogenic}} emission of CO 2 changes the carbonate chemistry and decreases the pH of the ocean. This {{can affect the}} speciation and the bioavailability of metals in polluted habitats such as estuaries. However, the effects of acidification on metal accumulation and stress response in estuarine organisms including bivalves are poorly understood. We studied {{the interactive effects of}} CO 2 and two common metal pollutants, copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), on metal accumulation, intracellular ATP/ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, stress response and energy metabolism in two common estuarine bivalves—Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and Mercenaria mercenaria (<b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> <b>clam).</b> Bivalves were exposed for 4 – 5 weeks to clean seawater (control) and to either 50 μg L− 1 Cu or 50 μg L− 1 Cd at one of three partial pressures of CO 2 (PCO 2 PCO 2 ∼ 395, ∼ 800 and ∼ 1500 μatm) representative of the present-day conditions and projections of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) for the years 2100 and 2250, respectively. Clams accumulated lower metal burdens than oysters, and elevated PCO 2 PCO 2 enhanced the Cd and Cu accumulation in mantle tissues in both species. Higher Cd and Cu burdens were associated with elevated mRNA expression of metal binding proteins metallothionein and ferritin. In the absence of added metals, proteasome activities of clams and oysters were robust to elevated PCO 2 PCO 2, but PCO 2 PCO 2 modulated the proteasome response to metals. Cd exposure stimulated the chymotrypsin-like activity of the oyster proteasome at all CO 2 levels. In contrast, trypsin- and caspase-like activities of the oyster proteasome were slightly inhibited by Cd exposure in normocapnia but this inhibition was reversed at elevated PCO 2 PCO 2. Cu exposure inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the oyster proteasome regardless of the exposure PCO 2 PCO 2. The effects of metal exposure on the proteasome activity were less pronounced in clams, likely due to the lower metal accumulation. However, the general trends (i. e. an increase during Cd exposure, inhibition during exposure to Cu, and overall stimulatory effects of elevated PCO 2 PCO 2) were similar to those found in oysters. Levels of mRNA for ubiquitin and tumor suppressor p 53 were suppressed by metal exposures in normocapnia in both species but this effect was alleviated or reversed at elevated PCO 2 PCO 2. Cellular energy status of oysters was maintained at all metal and CO 2 exposures, while in clams the simultaneous exposure to Cu and moderate hypercapnia (∼ 800 μatm PCO 2 PCO 2) led to a decline in glycogen, ATP and ADP levels and an increase in AMP indicating energy deficiency. These data suggest that environmental CO 2 levels can modulate accumulation and physiological effects of metals in bivalves in a species-specific manner which can affect their fitness and survival during the global change in estuaries. ...|$|R

The stage based population model assessed the late larval and juveniles stages of the <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> <b>clam</b> Mercenaria mercenaria. There were seven class sizes input into the model starting with pediveligers and ending with juveniles at specific developmental sizes: 0. 2 mm(Pediveliger), 0. 2 mm+ (Dissoconch I) and 1. 0 mm+ (Dissoconch II). Parameters or vital rates input into the model included growth, survival and saturation state. The aim of the model was to investigate by what degree the saturation state of CaCO 3 (Ωaragonite) influences the population dynamics of Mercenaria mercenaria. My project involved adding the seventh class size to the model, and changing the constant value of saturation state to a variable parameter on a diurnal cycle. Additionally, {{the assessment of the}} model output would be the focus of the research. The model was constructed in matlab, so the learning this software was necessary for the manipulation and completion of this model. The vital rates of survival and growth were probabilities defined from lab and field experiments published in the literature. Saturation state was incorporated into these probabilities as a way to change the values according to environmental conditions. The task of parameterizing saturation state as a cyclical function meant the reworking of how model probabilities were populated. Writing the function and integrating the varying saturation states to each time step was the dominate focus of the project before analysis. Background literature was necessary in order to establish a range of saturation state (Ω) values to input into the model. With accurate values of saturation state obtained, three different simulation trials were run to represent the diurnal variation. The simulations ranged from high (0. 20 – 2. 20), medium (0. 54 – 1. 86) and low (0. 87 - 1. 53). The values represent amplitudes of 0. 33, 0. 66 and 1. 0 within a diurnal cycle. By assessing the different simulation runs all with the same mean value of 1. 2, the characterization of dramatic shifts could be compared amongst the three simulation runs. Assessing the degree of change this variation had on the population was the main objective for the model output. Once the model was completed the objectives included: assessing what stage class had the highest sensitivity to changes in vital rates, evaluation of hourly mortality rates given varying diurnal cycles in saturation state, identifying specific time in days that the population reaches stable age distribution and survivors converge to ultimate size class, and compare population growth rate of large diurnal shifts or small shifts at constant undersaturation. The output of the model provided the necessary data to assess the population dynamics and answer the above objectives. Analysis of the data was completed in matlab and Microsoft excel. Future work for this model will be to create a separate carbonate chemistry which will run in parallel with the population model. The objective of this carbonate chemistry model will be to parameterize saturation state more completely by the components that constitute what saturation state is...|$|R

Narragansett Bay is a prominent feature of Rhode Island, making up over 500 km of coastline and acting as a watershed for over 2, 000 square meters of land in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This estuary is important to both the economy of the state of Rhode Island and its fringing ecosystems are necessary for a healthy shoreline. The beaches of Narragansett Bay revenue over $ 5 billion a year in tourism, stimulate more than 40, 000 jobs, and are a source of many economically important marine organisms such as oysters, mussels, <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> <b>clams,</b> finfish, and lobsters. The numerous fringing habitats of Narragansett Bay, including rocky intertidal zones, seagrasses, and estuarine marshes all play important roles for the coastline of Rhode Island, with salt marshes accounting for more than 600 ha of the shoreline. Salt marshes along Narragansett Bay serve many ecological roles including water quality maintenance, storm surge reduction, erosion control, and habitat and food to fish and wildlife. The ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa is the biomass-dominant benthic invertebrate in coastal marshes and is a foundation species, providing habitats for other organisms. Ribbed mussels have also been found to be a useful indicator species of nitrogen levels within Narragansett Bay, exhibiting increases in nitrogen-loads with greater biomass, density, and growth rates, and the δ 15 N signatures of G. demissa tissues reflect anthropogenic-derived nitrogen. The purpose of my thesis was to compare ribbed mussel populations in some of the same salt marshes along the well-documented nitrogen-loading gradient, 14 years after the previous studies and following the installation of one phase of a two-part wastewater reduction program into the bay. In addition, my work {{is part of a larger}} effort to investigate changes in greenhouse gas emissions by plants, sediment microbiota, and gut microbiota in the ribbed mussels, in response nitrogen-loading and elevated temperatures. Characterizing the mussel populations is integral to understanding the effects of global change on the Narragansett Bay ecosystem. The density, biomass, condition index, and growth rates of ribbed mussels were all positively correlated with the nitrogen-loading gradient in Narragansett Bay. Fecundity did not follow the same pattern but was significantly greater in June at one of the marshes and was negatively correlated with shell length and condition index. These results suggest that although mussels reproduce continuously, gametogenesis and spawning may have occurred prior to sampling. Another unexpected outcome is that with greater food availability resulting from nitrogen-loading, there are both costs and benefits. At the marsh with the highest nitrogen levels, Apponaug, the recruitment, growth, and condition index of the mussels were all significantly greater than at the other two marshes, but the high density may have limited the size of the mussels or even contributed to higher rates of mortality through intraspecific competition. At the opposite end of the nitrogen-loading gradient, mussels at Fox Hill had the greatest average shell length, but the density, biomass, condition index, recruitment, and growth rates were significantly lower than the other two marshes, suggesting that this less perturbed marsh may still be nitrogen-limited despite the historical nitrogen-loading in Narragansett Bay. The results from this study are critical for documenting the variation among the ribbed mussel populations within differing nitrogen-loaded marshes, but will also be used as a benchmark for a longer-term study analyzing the historical responses of this species to changes in nutrient loads into Narragansett Bay...|$|R

The <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs totally contributed maximum amountof essential amino acids (51. 096 %) and minimum was in soft shell crabs (43. 627 %). Among 10 nonessentialamino acids, 8 amino acids are reported in <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs and 7 amino acids are recorded in soft <b>shell</b> crabs. <b>Hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs totally contributed 53. 783 % of non essential amino acids and soft shell crabs 49. 719 %. In thepresent study, totally 5 minerals were reported both <b>hard</b> and soft <b>shell</b> crabs. The <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs contributedmaximum (3. 985 mg) of minerals and minimum was in soft shell crabs (3. 018 mg). The protein, carbohydrateand lipid contents {{were found to be}} higher in <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs than that of soft shell crabs. The individual andtotal amino acid (essential +non essential) contributions are much higher in <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs than soft shellcrabs. The total contribution of the minerals is higher in <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> crabs when compared to soft shell crabs. Sohard shell crabs are declared superior over soft shell crabs in term s of nutritive value...|$|R
50|$|While gig {{bags are}} lighter {{and easier to}} carry, they offer much less {{protection}} than padded <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> or wooden cases. As such, some musicians will own both soft gig bags and <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> cases for their instruments. This way, they can use the gig bag for local rehearsals, session work, and gigs, and use the <b>hard</b> <b>shell</b> case when their instrument will be checked onto airline baggage.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} {{and spread}} of brown ring disease (BRD) to several northern Mediterranean coasts is described. We report {{the results of}} a 6 -y surveillance of BRD in natural populations of carpet <b>shell</b> <b>clams</b> (Ruditapes decussatus) in 14 zones along the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia (southern Mediterranean Sea). BRD symptoms in adult animals resulting from conchiolin deposits in inner parts of carpet shell were observed in all zones surveyed. Infestation rates within each site ranged from 65 - 100 %, and BRD prevalence varied from 1 - 58 % of clams in winter and from 1 - 33 % in summer. Positive correlations were demonstrated between BRD prevalence and Vibrio spp. concentrations in clams. Vibrio tapetis was not identified among the bacterial organisms, suggesting that other marine Vibrio species are capable of causing BRD-like illness in carpet <b>shell</b> <b>clams...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceHemocytes are {{the immune}} effectors in clams, {{directing}} cellular but also humoral defences. In the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and the carpet <b>shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Ruditapes decussatus), two phenotypically similar venerid species, fishery and aquaculture importance motivated scientific studies to improve {{knowledge about the}} participation of hemocytes in immune response. Currently, gaps still persist concerning the classification of hemocyte sub-populations {{as well as their}} non-immune activities. This review summarizes current knowledge about hemocytes of the Manila clam and the carpet <b>shell</b> <b>clam,</b> suggests some probable misinterpretations arising from extrapolations from other bivalves and vertebrates, and suggests future research prospects. The susceptibility of hemocytes to environmental modifications as well as biological and chemical toxicants is also re-evaluated. Hemocytes of bivalves are not limited in function to immunity and should be considered in a wider scheme including the environment and whole-animal physiology...|$|R
