Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all sorts of stuff. It just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I just kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E
500|$|Madonna and Bray {{started on}} the {{re-recording}} and changed some portion of the lyrics. Bray commented on the recording sessions as: [...] "I've always <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> the rib cage and the skeleton [...] of the song already– she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut [...] She writes in a stream of mood really." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted {{that at one point}} of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron was {{an atheist}} {{in his early}} teens. When he was 17, {{during the height of}} his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding." ...|$|E

500|$|Drake then {{contacted}} Songz, who {{had been}} working with Drake back since 2007 on mixtapes. Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track. After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Madonna and Rodgers' {{collective}} energy—she {{wanting to}} score with a smash second album and he {{wanting to be}} the producer {{to give it to}} her—drove the production of Like a Virgin with great precision." [...] Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many of the album's songs. Reflecting on the music composition for the album, Bray noted: [...] "I've always <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> the rib cage and the skeleton of the songs already—she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut." [...] The opening track [...] "Material Girl" [...] was written by Peter Brown and Roberta Rans. Madonna explained that the concept of the song was similar to her life's situation at that time. According to her, the song was provocative, hence she was attracted to it. [...] "Material Girl" [...] incorporated new wave music and consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, rather than romance and relationships. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, [...] "Angel" [...] is the second track on the album. It {{was one of the first}} songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by, and subsequently falls in love with an angel. [...] "Angel" [...] consists of a three-chord ascending hook, which serves as the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's savior. The title track [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. It was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records, after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a good enough hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind. He credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo. In sexual terms, the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people.|$|E

The breaking up and the hard stuff in our relationship happened sort of after I was out of the spotlight for a while and writing. It wasn't in any way public.

So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer--she chipped in and says, [...] "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change"--that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.|$|E
6000|$|The d'Humières {{have just}} been lunching with me, and that has so reknotted the silver cord that {{stretched}} so tense from {{the first days of}} last March to the first of those of May--wasn't it?--that I feel it a folly in addition to a shame not yet to have written to you (as I have been daily and hourly yearning to do) ever since my return from Italy about a month ago. You flung me the handkerchief, Edith, just at that time--literally cast it at my feet: it met me, exactly, bounding--rebounding--from my hall-table as I recrossed my threshold after my long absence; which fact makes this tardy response, I am well aware, all the more graceless. And then came the charming little picture-card of the poor Lamb House hack grinding out his patient prose under your light lash and dear Walter B.'s--which should have accelerated my production to the point of its breaking in waves at your feet: and yet it's only to-night that my overburdened spirit--pushing its way, ever since my return, through the accumulations and arrears, in every sort, of absence--puts pen to paper for your especial benefit--if benefit it be. The charming d'Humières both, as I say, touring--training--in England, through horrid wind and weather, with a bonne grace and a wit and a Parisianism worthy of a better cause, amiably lunched with me a couple of days since on their way from town to Folkestone, and so back to Plassac (don't you like [...] "Plassac," [...] down in our dear old Gascony?) the seat of M. de Dampierre--to whom, à ce qu'il paraît, that day at luncheon we were all exquisitely sympathetic! Well, it threw back the bridge across the gulfs and the months, even to the very spot where the great nobly-clanging glass door used to open to the arrested, the engulfing and disgorging car--for we sat in my little garden here and talked about you galore and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>made</b> plans (wild vain dreams, though I didn't let them see it!) for our all somehow being together again.... But oh, I should like to remount the stream of time much further back than their passage here--if it weren't (as it somehow always is when I get at urgent letters) ever so much past midnight. It was only with my final return hither that my deep draught of riotous living came to an end, and as the cup had originally been held to my lips all by your hands I somehow felt in presence of your interest and sympathy up to the very last, and as if you absolutely should have been avertie from day to day--I did the matter that justice at least. Too much of the story has by this time dropped out; but there are bits I wish I could save for you.... But I must break off--it's 1.15 a.m.! ...|$|E
