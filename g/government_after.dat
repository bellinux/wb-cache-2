5|$|Poedjangga Baroe {{was closed}} {{with the fall}} of the Dutch East Indies <b>government</b> <b>after</b> the Japanese invaded the Indies in February 1942; the last issue {{published}} covered the period of December 1941 to February 1942.

5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the <b>government</b> <b>after</b> the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E

5|$|After a spell in {{civilian}} life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No.3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and {{worked closely with}} Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese War at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth <b>government.</b> <b>After</b> the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan <b>government</b> <b>after</b> 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Coutances took {{no further}} part in English <b>government</b> <b>after</b> {{returning}} from Germany. Instead he {{became involved in}} Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andely manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the castle of Gaillard on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King Philip II of France. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.|$|E

In 2014, Dar was made the chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Election Reforms. He was also made the chairman of Economic Coordination Committee by Nawaz Sharif. During the third premiership of Nawaz Sharif, Dar was considered so powerful person in the <b>government</b> <b>after</b> Prime Minister that he was dubbed as de facto Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan. He was serving as chairman of over 45 committees at one time. In 2016, Dar looked after important government matters when Nawaz Sharif underwent heart surgery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the <b>government</b> <b>after</b> less than a year in power.|$|E
5|$|He {{became an}} agent to take {{acknowledgements}} to instruments on September12, 1884. On January 1, 1886, he {{was listed as}} one of the speakers at a political rally at Halawa.

He criticized the exclusion of the Chinese and Japanese from the vote, especially focusing on the latter group because of Hawaii's treaty with the Empire of Japan. By 1890, he had returned to his native island of Maui.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new <b>government.</b> <b>After</b> Museveni's inauguration as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army; Kagame {{was the head of}} military intelligence. In addition to their army duties, Kagame and Rwigyema began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for an attack on Rwanda. In 1989 Rwanda's President Habyarimana and many Ugandans in the army began to criticise Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions, and he demoted Kagame and Rwigyema.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the <b>government.</b> <b>After</b> hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Mendenhall, {{a senior}} Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, {{advocated}} {{the removal of}} Diệm in a military coup and his replacement with Thơ.

By this time, Diệm and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General Tôn Thất Đính, a palace favourite was involved.
