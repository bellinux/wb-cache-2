30|$|<b>Dowel</b> {{bars are}} {{commonly}} used in jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) as a load transfer device across joints, especially for pavements with heavy traffic.

50|$|The {{building}} is a simple, timber-framed structure on low timber stumps, with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The street or northern facade has a symmetrical verandah with a central gabled entry porch, and bull-nosed verandah roofs to either side. A timber parapet divides this from the roof over {{the main body of}} the building. There is a frieze of flat pressed metal panels to the entry porch, and to the ends of the bull nosed roofs. The porch ceiling is of tongue and groove boards, the remainder being unlined. The verandah has a <b>dowelled</b> and cross-braced timber balustrade with diagonal lattice panels above. There is a pair of <b>dowelled</b> gates to the entry. The original gates were taller and remnants of these still exist stored under the building. The verandah also has chamfered timber posts with timber capitals, and a cast iron lace frieze with brackets.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the in vitro fracture resistance of roots with glass-fiber and metal <b>dowels</b> with different designs. METHODS: Fifty-endodontically treated maxillary central incisors were embedded in acrylic resin. Ten of them received only the coronary preparation, {{and the remaining}} forty were embedded (except for 4 mm of the cervical area) after removing the clinical crowns. Specimens were divided into five groups (n= 10) : control (teeth with only coronary preparation), cylindrical cast <b>dowel,</b> conical cast <b>dowel,</b> cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel.</b> Specimens were subjected to an increasing compressive load (N) until fracture. RESULTS: ANOVA indicated significant difference (P<. 05) among the groups, and the Tukey-Kramer´s test identified these differences. The control group (867 ± 243 N) presented the highest values and was statistically similar to cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> group (711 ± 180 N). There is no significant difference among the metal <b>dowel</b> cylindrical (435 ± 245 N) or conical (585 ± 164 N) group and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> (453 ± 112 N).

40|$|PURPOSES: The problem {{under this}} {{circumstance}} {{is that the}} erosion not only drops strength of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar but also comes with volume expansion of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar which can reduce load transferring efficiency of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar. To avoid this erosion problem, alternative dowers bars are developed. METHODS: In this study, the bearing stresses between the FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bar and concrete slab are calculated and compared with its allowable bearing stress to check its structural stability in the concrete pavement. These comparisons are conducted with several cross-sections of FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bars. Comprehensive laboratory tests including the shear load-deflection test on a full-scale specimen and the full-scale accelerated joint concrete pavement test are conducted {{and the results were}} compared with those from the steel <b>dowel</b> bar.

40|$|Jointed plain {{concrete}} pavements use <b>dowel</b> bars to transfer load across transverse joints. The {{job of the}} designer is to optimize the number, size, and location of the <b>dowels</b> in a given pavement. This research used data from two different construction locations. The first project evaluated the performance of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical shaped <b>dowel</b> bars at different spacing intervals using full <b>dowel</b> baskets. The performance potential of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical <b>dowels</b> placed in the wheel paths only was also evaluated on the same project. The second project compared corrosion resistant <b>dowel</b> bar (stainless steel and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) <b>dowel</b> bars) performance to round 1. 5 inch epoxy-coated steel <b>dowel</b> bars. The stainless steel and GFRP bars are for possible use in environments where steel corrosion may be an issue. Performance data was measured on both projects in terms of deflections, using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data collected biannually. Joint faulting data was collected over the five-year test period for both projects. Roughness data was collected for only the elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar project over the five-year test period. Resilient modulus values were found by triaxial testing of the pavement subgrade samples. Performance criteria graphed verses resilient modulus allowed for the comparison of different <b>dowels</b> as the subgrade resilient modulus changed. The elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar study indicated medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch or 15 inch spacing perform equally to the standard 1. 5 inch round <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch spacing. The elliptical study also indicated the potential use of medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> bars in wheel paths only.

The dress {{of the figures}} has not yet reached the naturalism of the mature classical, yet in the temple sculptures there is {{evidence}} of an experimentation not pursued by the younger Greek sculptors. The Olympia Master's work achieves a complexity of emotion that exceeds the conventions of the archaic; we find pathos, hubris, tension, exhaustion, disgust - markedly so in his characterization of Herakles, nuances lost to the idealised art of the later 5th century. The east pediment represents Pelops’s race against Oinomaos for the hand of Hippodamia, seemingly at the moment of the oath of the two contestants before Zeus himself. On the west we find Theseus and Perithoos fighting the Centaurs at the point of greatest violence in contrast to the instant of duplicitous tension on the east.

Within this framework an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the <b>dowel</b> action in 27 reinforced concrete specimens fitted up with a single deformed bar of 14, 18, and 24 -mm diameter (No. 5, 6, and 8). The shear response of the <b>dowel</b> bar, the displacements and curvatures up to failure, and the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment were measured or evaluated. The tests give new evidence on the behavior of <b>dowel</b> action and allow further checks of the models available in literature for predicing <b>dowel</b> strength and stiffness. Furthermore, suitable formulations are proposed for the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment to allow the professional engineer to design a <b>dowel</b> bar or introduce <b>dowel</b> action in a safer and more consistent way...|$|R

A <b>dowel</b> hole is drilled {{laterally}} across the bolt hole and the cross <b>dowel</b> is inserted into it. A screwdriver is inserted into the slot {{at the end of}} the cross <b>dowel</b> and the <b>dowel</b> is rotated so that its threaded hole aligns with the bolt hole. The bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross <b>dowel</b> until the wood pieces are held tightly together.|$|R
