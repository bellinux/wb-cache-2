25|$|The name of {{the town}} appears in the Domesday Book as Blachebourne, a royal manor during the days of Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. Archaeological {{evidence}} from the demolition of the medieval parish church {{on the site of}} the cathedral in 1820 suggests that a church was built during the late 11th or early 12th century. A market cross was also erected nearby in 1101. The manor came into the possession of Henry deBlackburn, who divided <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> two sons. Later, one half was granted to the monks of Stanlow Abbey and this moiety was subsequently granted to the monks of Whalley Abbey. During the 12thcentury, the town's importance declined as Clitheroe became the regional centre. In addition to a settlement in the town centre area, there were several other medieval domiciles nearby.|$|E
500|$|That {{afternoon}} his platoon {{was conducting}} combat control operations {{in an effort}} to reduce and control sectarian violence in the area. While Private McGinnis was manning the M2 [...]50-caliber Machine Gun, a fragmentation grenade thrown by an insurgent fell through the gunner's hatch into the vehicle. Reacting quickly, he yelled [...] "grenade," [...] allowing all four members of his crew to prepare for the grenade's blast. Then, rather than leaping from the gunner's hatch to safety, Private McGinnis made the courageous decision to protect his crew. In a selfless act of bravery, in which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis covered the live grenade, pinning <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> body and the vehicle and absorbing most of the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|In 899, Atenulf I of Capua conquered Benevento {{and united}} the two duchies. [...] He {{declared}} them inseparable and introduced {{the principle of}} co-rule, whereby sons {{would be associated with}} their fathers, a principle soon borrowed by Salerno. [...] However, all Langobardia minor was unified for the last time by Duke Pandulf Ironhead, who became prince of Salerno in 978. He succeeded in making Benevento an archdiocese in 969. Before his death (March 981), he had gained from Emperor Otto I the title of Duke of Spoleto also. However, he split <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> sons: Landulf IV received Benevento-Capua and Pandulf II, Salerno. Soon, Benevento was stripped away again when Pandulf, the Ironhead's nephew, rebelled, demanding his part of the inheritance.|$|E

2500|$|Georgescu {{was born}} in the river port of Sulina, Tulcea County, Romania on September 12, 1887. [...] His father, Leonte, was head of customs, and his mother, Elena, was the {{daughter}} of the captain of the port. [...] As Leonte took up positions in various ports along the Danube, the family moved to Galaţi and then Giurgiu. [...] In Galaţi, the toddler George found and, placing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> legs like a cello, began playing a violin that his father had won in a raffle; Leonte, who did not want his son to be a [...] "fiddler", was not pleased, but nonetheless Georgescu began violin lessons at age five. [...] Later, he would transfer his attention to the cello. [...] While in elementary school, he composed a waltz that impressed the school's music teacher, who thereafter called on George as a substitute school choir director.|$|E
2500|$|Cecily's husband, {{a notorious}} womaniser, {{shared the same}} mistress, Jane Shore with his {{stepfather}} King Edward. When the King died in April 1483, Jane then became the mistress of Cecily's stepfather Baron Hastings. This new situation only deepened the sour relations between Hastings and Thomas. Together with his mother Thomas attempted to seize power immediately following the King's death as the new king Edward V was a minor of 12. Thomas had stolen part of the royal treasure from the Tower of London, dividing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> mother and uncle Sir Edward Woodville who used his portion to equip a fleet of ships at Thomas's instigation; ostensibly to patrol the English coasts against French pirates {{but in fact it}} was a Woodville fleet to be used against their enemies within England. Jane Shore was instrumental in Hastings' defection from the side of King Edward's youngest brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester who had been made Lord Protector of the realm by the will of Edward IV. In this position of authority Richard had gathered a force of friends, local gentry and retainers, headed south in an armed cavalcade from his Yorkshire stronghold of Middleham Castle to take into protective custody and [...] separate the young king from the Woodvilles, putting a prompt end to their ambitions and long dominion at court. Jane persuaded Hastings to join the Woodville family in a conspiracy aimed at removing the Lord Protector, and when Richard was apprised of Hastings' treachery, he ordered his immediate execution on 13 June 1483 at the Tower of London. Hastings was not attainted, however, and Cecily's mother was placed under Richard's protection.|$|E
2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first she hesitates because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus stare at her, Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls out a cigarette and puts <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> lips. Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E

60|$|He {{took a quick}} {{step towards}} her. In his tone was the ring of mastery, the light in his eyes was compelling. She shrank back, but he seized one of her hands. <b>It</b> lay <b>between</b> <b>his,</b> a cold dead thing.|$|R
60|$|He waited. The slender stem of {{the pipe}} with its bulky lump of a bowl at the end hung down from his thick lips. It had gone out. Suddenly he took <b>it</b> from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> teeth and wrung his hands slightly.|$|R
60|$|He spoke <b>it</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> teeth, {{his eyes}} {{kindling}} angrily again.|$|E

60|$|He placed <b>it</b> <b>between</b> them, reposed <b>his</b> arm on {{the back}} of Caroline's chair, and thus began to read.|$|R

60|$|He {{took out}} a {{blackened}} pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until {{it was in a}} bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into <b>it</b> from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned it}} over. It {{was an awkward}} thing to carry; it had so very many corners. But he succeeded at last in getting <b>it</b> firmly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> beak, and in haste, lest some other bird should seek to dispute with him its possession, at once flew off with it.|$|R
60|$|Mr Fledgeby {{appeared}} {{to be on the}} verge of some mutinous expressions, when his hand happened to touch his nose.

60|$|I {{ought to}} have been firm, but I thought that perhaps he really did know {{something}} about the business. I went to the tool shed to see what I could find.
