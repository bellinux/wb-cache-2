5000|$|The {{established}} Resistance groups soon {{made contact}} with the maquis, providing them with para-military training. Frenay later remembered: We established contact with them through our departmental and regional chiefs. Usually these little maquis voluntarily followed our instructions, in return for which they expected food, arms and ammunition...It {{seemed to me that}} these groups, which were now in hiding all over the French mountain country, might well be transformed into an awesome combat weapon. The maquisards were all young, all volunteers, all itching for action...It was up to use to organize them and give them a sense of their role in the struggle. The terrain of central and southern France with its forests, mountains, and shrubland were ideal for hiding and unless the authorities were prepared to commit thousands of men to hunt the maquis down, it was quite possible to evade authority in this landscape. The Germans simply did not have the spare men-power for such operations and instead sent spotter planes to find the maquis, who provided that they were careful about concealing their fires could usually avoid aerial detection. The only other way of breaking up the maquis bands was to send in a spy, which was highly dangerous work as the maquisards would summarily execute any infiltrator working for the Germans or Vichy who was exposed. Joining the young men fleeing the service with the STO were others targeted by the Reich like Jews, Spanish Republican refugees, and Allied airmen shot down over France. One maquis band in the Cévennes region consisted of German communists who had fought in the Spanish Civil War who fled to France in 1939. A striking aspect of the maquis was unlike the urban-based resistance groups that emerged in 1940-42 who took political names like Combat, Liberté or Libération, the maquis bands chose apolitical names like the names of animals such as Ours, Loup, Tigre, Lion, Puma, Rhinocéros and Eléphant; or names of people like the Maquis Bernard, the Maquis Socrate, the Maquis Henri Bourgogne; or one maquis band whose leader was a doctor, hence the name Maquis le Doc.The maquis bands that emerged in the countryside soon formed a sub-culture with its own slang, way of dressing and rules.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests long work hours adversely affect mental health across a variety of domains. Mental health issues have been found to negatively affect work performance. This finding was highlighted in the aviation industry by the 2015 Germanwings incident in which 150 people died. Further investigation into work hours and their associated factors (e. g., demographic characteristics and experiences of sleep and fatigue in the cockpit) contributing to mental health issues among pilots is warranted. A cross-sectional survey investigating attitudes and experiences of fatigue was developed and distributed to commercial airline pilots. Results found pilots who reported typically spending longer <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> per week were twice as likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. Pilots' experiences of job-related sleep disturbance and fatigue may explain why pilots who typically spend long <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> each week are more likely to report feeling depressed or anxious...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{arguments}} {{in favour of}} introducing shift work clearly depend on productivity and safety being maintained at an acceptable level. However, the evidence reviewed in this paper clearly indicates that both productivity and safety may be compromised at night. More specifically, safety declines over successive night shifts, with increasing <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> and between successive rest breaks. The only known way to minimize these problems is to improve shift systems with respect to these factors. However, these factors {{need to be considered}} in combination with one another since, for example, a long night shift that includes frequent rest breaks might well prove safer than a shorter night shift with less frequent breaks...|$|E
