This paper investigates whether international policy coordination is appropriate in the case of <b>international</b> <b>transit</b> traffic causing a local environmental externality. This issue is analysed in a two-country model where traffic is used as an input in production. It is found that individual optimization of the countries is likely to result in an outcome with less than optimal international traffic, i. e. too little pollution compared with optimum.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{high-speed}} network architecture called Dynamic Transfer Mode, DTM. At {{the entrance of}} the DTM network, destination addresses such as IP addresses are converted into DTM routing information and attached to the packet header. In a DTM network, a connection is set up on-the-fly by sending a series of routing link identifiers to the destination, so burst data transfers like WWW tra#c are efficiently carried. A connection between adjacent nodes is created and released dynamically within the burst transfer period. This yields higher statistical multiplexing gain and improved bandwidth e#ciency compared to with conventional STM. Time division multiplexing is utilized so delay jitter or cell loss, the major drawbacks of Asynchronous Transfer Mode, are avoided. This paper analyzes the performance of a DTM network and describes an implemented switching system. Because a DTM network uses source-routing and passive STM switching, it simplifies the core <b>transit</b> <b>switch</b> while localizing intelligence to edge nodes. A simplified core <b>transit</b> <b>switch</b> is well suited for future high-speed backbone networks...|$|R
