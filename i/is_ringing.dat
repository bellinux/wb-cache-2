25|$|An extra scene, {{involving}} Jones {{taking off}} her chain-metal dress which <b>is</b> <b>ringing</b> off the metal detectors and walking through them naked, {{was shot in}} Newark Airport.

25|$|During the night, many {{external}} stimuli may bombard the senses, but {{the brain}} often interprets the stimulus {{and makes it}} {{a part of a}} dream to ensure continued sleep. Dream incorporation is a phenomenon whereby an actual sensation, such as environmental sounds, is incorporated into dreams, such as hearing a phone ringing in a dream while it <b>is</b> <b>ringing</b> in reality or dreaming of urination while wetting the bed. The mind can, however, awaken an individual if they are in danger or if trained to respond to certain sounds, such as a baby crying.|$|E

The church clock strikes the quarter. A stonemason passes me by, his tools under his arm, humming a tune. It makes me realise that the “peaceful, normal” way of life is returning.|$|E

2500|$|During her Patchin Place years, Barnes {{became a}} notorious recluse, {{intensely}} suspicious of anyone {{she did not}} know well. E. E. Cummings, who lived across the street, would check on her periodically by shouting out his window, [...] "Are you still alive, Djuna?" [...] Bertha Harris put roses in her mailbox, but never succeeded in meeting her; Carson McCullers camped on her doorstep, but Barnes only called down, [...] "Whoever <b>is</b> <b>ringing</b> this bell, please go the hell away." [...] Anaïs Nin was an ardent fan of her work, especially Nightwood. She wrote to Barnes several times inviting her to participate in a journal on women's writing, but received no reply.|$|E
2500|$|While the Supreme Court's {{opinion in}} Bilski v.

[...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring at her in the club.
