500|$|Three {{days after}} Frederick was {{confirmed}} to {{be suffering from}} cancer, his father Kaiser William I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on 9 March 1888, upon which Frederick became German Emperor and King of Prussia. His son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news to his father in Italy. Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, [...] "...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense." [...] Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines. Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered {{a continuation of the}} old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia. The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his [...] "pitiful" [...] appearance. The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve. In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress. Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.|$|E

2500|$|Looking {{to pick up}} {{some extra}} money, Connery helped out {{backstage}} at the King's Theatre in late 1951. He became interested in the proceedings, and a career was launched. During a bodybuilding competition held in London in 1953, one of the competitors mentioned that auditions were being held for a production of South Pacific, and Connery landed a small part as one of the Seabees chorus boys. By the time the production reached Edinburgh, he had been given the part of Marine Cpl Hamilton Steeves and was understudying two of the juvenile leads, and his salary was raised from £12 to £14–10s a week. The production returned the following year out of popular demand, and Connery was promoted to the featured role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, which Larry Hagman had portrayed in the West End. While in Edinburgh, Connery was targeted by the notorious Valdor gang, one of the most ruthless gangs in the city. He was first approached by them in a billiard hall on Lothian Street where he prevented them from stealing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and was later followed by six gang members to a 15ft high balcony at the Palais. There Connery launched an attack singlehandedly against the gang members, grabbing one by the throat and another by a biceps and cracked their heads together. From then on he was treated with great respect by the gang and gained a reputation as a [...] "hard man".|$|E

60|$|Months of wageless and thankless {{service had}} dimmed the admiral's splendour. His red {{trousers}} were patched and ragged.

60|$|The Nome King {{had left}} his throne and pressed through his warriors to the front ranks, {{so he could see}} what was going on; but as he faced Ozma and her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to action by the valor of the private, drew one of Billina's eggs <b>from</b> <b>his</b> right <b>jacket</b> pocket and hurled it {{straight}} at the little monarch's head.|$|R

60|$|The Duke of Dulham {{had landed}} in New York {{five days before}} and had looked round eagerly for a field of turnips, but hadn't seen any.

60|$|After a while, Weston, {{lowering}} the headsail, dropped the anchor over {{close to the}} beach, and Major Kinnaird paddled a canoe off gingerly. He was, as usual, immaculately neat, and Weston noticed the contrast between him and Stirling, whose garments had apparently grown smaller with the wetting. The latter pitched his valise into the canoe without waiting for Weston to see to it, and then stood up endeavoring to squeeze some of the water <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E
60|$|Maxwell walked {{straight}} on until {{he turned and}} glanced over his shoulder; then he shook the moisture <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> and in doing so, let his hand slip from its lower corner to his revolver holster.

There was now no sign of an enemy's presence in all the jungle; only the splashing and panting of the carriers behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{glad to hear}} it," [...] {{said the}} new master, {{regarding}} the old man with raised eyebrows, as he extricated a plethoric-looking canvas bag <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket and dropped it with a musical crash on the chipped office table. His eyebrows went still higher, as the old man unfastened the string, and emptying the contents on to the table, knitted his brows into reflective wrinkles, and began to debit the firm with all the liabilities of a slow but tenacious memory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I not soften {{you in any}} way?" [...] he cried.

60|$|That {{evening the}} boy Prince and the fat King dined in great {{state in the}} lofty-domed dining hall of the palace, where forty {{servants}} waited upon them.

60|$|There were no fish to catch, {{but there}} was a boy trying to catch them. He was on the {{opposite}} bank; had crawled down it, only other boys can tell how, a barefooted urchin of ten or twelve, with an enormous bagful of worms hanging <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> button. To put a new worm on the hook without coming to destruction, he first twisted his legs about a young birch, and put his arms round it. He was after a big one, he informed Corp, though {{he might as well have}} been fishing in a treatise on the art of angling.|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the hill he passed by the green and white Rectory, and there was the parson, a short fat, pursy man with wrists {{protruding}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> sleeves as he stood on tip-toe tying up a rambling rose-shoot on his trim cedared lawn. The next house barely showed its old red chimney-tops, above its bowers; the next was empty, with windows vacantly gazing, its paths peopled with great bearded weeds that stood mutely watching and guarding the seldom-opened gate. Then came more lofty grandmotherly elms, a dense hedge of every leaf that pricks, and then Lawford found himself standing at the small canopied gate of the queer old wooden house that the stranger of his talk had in part described.|$|E

"Yes, Donna Maria, it was I; and if Lord John Russell were {{to dress}} {{himself in the}} same way--" [...] But I {{had no time to}} {{complete}} my description of what might occur under so extravagantly impossible a combination of circumstances, for as I was yet speaking, the little door leading out on to the leads of the tower was opened and my friend, the mayo of the boat, still bearing gewgaws on his back, stepped up on to the platform. My eye instantly perceived that the one pendule was still missing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> He did not come alone, but three other gentlemen followed him, who, however, had no peculiarities in their dress. He saw me at once and bowed and smiled; and then observing Donna Maria, he lifted his cap from his head, and addressing himself to her in Spanish, began to converse with her as though she were an old friend.|$|E

60|$|So all {{the rest}} of that day they journeyed onward together, until, towards evening, they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs and tall spires. The servant's {{companion}} entered the gate as though he knew the place right well, and led the way up one street and down another, until, by-and-by, they came to a noble house that stood a little apart by itself, with gardens of flowers and fruit-trees all around it. There the travelling companion stopped, and, drawing out a little pipe <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> began playing so sweetly upon it that he made one's heart stand still to listen to the music.|$|R

After arriving at school around 8:00 a.m., he aimed the shotgun at a social studies teacher. The school custodian, Dave Thompson, wrestled the shotgun away from Hainstock. Principal John Alfred Klang then entered the hallway and confronted Hainstock, who was still armed with the handgun. Hainstock grabbed the revolver <b>from</b> inside <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and fired several shots. Klang then grabbed Hainstock, wrestled {{him to the ground}} and swept away the gun. Klang was on top of Hainstock, a pool of blood by Klang's leg. Staff and students apprehended Hainstock, holding him until the police arrived.|$|R
