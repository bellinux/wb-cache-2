50|$|Also {{note that}} the designations right hand and left hand are applied {{similarly}} to other types of bevel gear, <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears,</b> and oblique tooth face gears.|$|E
50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the <b>gear.</b> The <b>hypoid</b> pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. <b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> with more efficient spiral bevel gears in automotive use because the spiral bevel gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque.

Transmission efficiency as well noise and vibration concerns require combined elastohydrodynamic and tooth contact analysis of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> teeth pairs through mesh. Although such analyses have been reported for general cases of elliptical point contact conjunctions with angled flow entrainment, they do not comply with the prevailing load and kinematic conditions in differential gears. In particular, teeth pair contacts are subject to significant loads of order of several kN requiring solution to the EHL problem at such high loads.

40|$|In general, a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> and {{a spiral}} bevel gear for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear.</b> The tooth surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting pitch cone instead of the pitch cone and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear.</b> In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the tooth bearing pattern compared with a tapered tooth...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are stronger, operate more {{quietly and}} can be used for higher {{reduction}} ratios, however they also have some sliding action along the teeth, which reduces mechanical efficiency, the energy losses being in the form of heat produced in the gear surfaces and the lubricating fluid.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A fully coupled tribo-dynamic model, capable of {{predicting}} the inefficiency and dynamic response of automotive differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> pairs, {{is presented in}} this study. A gear dynamics solver is coupled with an analytical friction solver, which calculates the viscous shear, {{as well as the}} boundary conjunctional friction force. The time varying geometry and contact characteristics of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> pair are taken into account by using realistic data available in the literature. The rheological models employed cover a range of two different behaviors: Newtonian and non-Newtonian Eyring (shear thinning). The Chittenden-Dowson equation is used to calculate the central film thickness of the elasto-hydrodynamic teeth conjunctions. The boundary friction force is calculated using the Greenwood & Tripp model. Finally, the actual surface topography of a run-in <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is obtained using a stylus profilometer. The results indicate an overestimation of the viscous friction by the Newtonian model, as opposed with the non-Newtonian model, mainly due to shear thinning effects. Comparative studies are performed for different operating conditions, namely near or away from resonance, as well as for conditions corresponding to a non-linear sub-harmonic resonance.
