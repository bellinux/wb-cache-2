5|$|From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic {{was written}} in a {{complicated}} orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time.

40|$|<b>Effective</b> reward <b>and</b> {{incentive}} scheme {{has become a}} tool for organizational effectiveness in the 21 st century. <b>Effective</b> reward <b>and</b> {{incentive scheme}} can benefit many organizations if managed properly.

The paper reviews literature on the effect of <b>effective</b> reward <b>and</b> incentive scheme on organizational performance. The paper concludes that the success of organizations to a very large extent depends on how <b>effective</b> their reward <b>and</b> incentive schemes are. The paper recommends that managers should put in place an <b>effective</b> reward <b>and</b> incentive scheme that sufficiently motivates employees as this could enhance their productivity, responsiveness and commitment to the achievement of the organizational goals. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less <b>effective,</b> <b>and</b> led to development of stealth ships, {{a form of}} radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1974.

The wholesale cost {{in the developing world}} is about 3.88 to 32.79 USD per 50mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacteria Streptomyces peucetius.|$|E

Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|Hirst {{completed}} the 14th and final double {{of his career}} in 1913, leading the Yorkshire batting averages with 1,540 runs at an average of 35.81. His bowling was not as <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> he was no longer Yorkshire's main attacking bowler, as Alonzo Drake and Major Booth headed the averages. Hirst took 101 wickets at 20.13. During the following season, the last before the First World War, Hirst was further afflicted by injuries and missed some matches. He bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets, which cost 29.81, were his fewest since 1898; {{it was the first time}} since 1902 he failed to complete the double. His batting remained <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances, although his two centuries were against the weaker bowling attacks of Northamptonshire and Somerset. He scored 1,670 runs at 41.75. In June, he was selected in a match to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the current Lord's ground, playing for the Rest of England against the MCC side which had toured South Africa the previous winter. The outbreak of war brought the season to an early close in August.|$|E
