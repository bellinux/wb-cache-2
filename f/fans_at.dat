5|$|Charlton {{resigned}} {{at the end}} of pre-season {{training for}} the 1985–86 campaign after <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> St James' Park started calling for his dismissal after the club failed to secure the signing of Eric Gates, who instead joined Lawrie McMenemy at Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2011, as part {{of their}} PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica {{for the first time to}} a 30,000 crowd of <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the National Stadium. The {{following}} month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|A point-per-game pace in 1984–85 (66points in 67games) earned MacInnis {{his first}} All-Star Game appearance, playing {{in front of}} his {{hometown}} <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the 1985 game in Calgary. He was voted a Second-Team All-Star for the 1986–87 NHL season, and started his first All-Star Game in 1988. He was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman in the league in three consecutive seasons, 1989, 1990 and 1991, but failed to win the award each time.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in full colour, which {{is not always the}} case for other series.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various sanctions against the national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Euro 2004. UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar incidents in the past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for trespassing. There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as improper conduct by Croatia <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Hamm retired at age 32 with {{a record}} 158 {{international}} goals. She and teammates Foudy and Fawcett were honored with a pre-game ceremony where they were presented with framed jerseys and roses in front of 15,549 <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Home Depot Stadium in Carson, California. During the 5–0 win against Mexico, Hamm provided the assist {{on the first two}} goals. Following her retirement, Hamm's #9 jersey was inherited by midfielder Heather O'Reilly.|$|E

5|$|Maksimir Stadium was {{the scene}} of a politically-fueled riot between Croat and Serb <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> a Dinamo Zagreb– Red Star Belgrade game {{following}} the 1990 parliamentary election. However, there have been no major issues between Croatian and Serbian supporters since then. The Croatian Football Federation and the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) both agreed to play the scheduled 2014 World Cup qualifying matches between the two sides without away supporters.|$|E
5|$|On Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse {{defeated}} Johns Hopkins in {{the national}} championship game 13–10 in front of 48,970 <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Gillette Stadium. This game set the attendance record for the NCAA lacrosse championship game and for any NCAA outdoor championship. This marks the 10th victory in a national championship game for the Syracuse program. This is John Desko's, Syracuse's Head coach, fourth championship in his ten-year career at Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{was known}} for a notorious {{incident}} at a Carolina Hurricanes game, as he attended the matchup with the Florida Panthers sporting a throwback Philadelphia Flyers jersey on. Upon being recognized by the <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the arena, the team's cheerleaders approached him with a Hurricanes alternate jersey sported by the team. The incident was noted as he was seen taking off the jersey and baring his chest for the crowd to see.|$|E

5|$|SVT {{made the}} advance {{decision}} to allocate Denmark at one semi-final and Norway at the other, in {{consideration for the}} number of Danish and Norwegian fans likely to come, with the arena being relatively small and so not suitable for accommodating both countries' <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> one semi-final event. Øresund bridge was eventually also used as the main artistic medium for the theme of the contest, as an expression of binding cultures.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to the {{expansion}} draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Liberty bowl {{kicked off}} on a cold and blustery day in front of 46,206 <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee on December 14, 1968. The record crowd (it was {{the largest in the}} 10-year history of the bowl to that point) {{consumed}} 20,000 hot dogs—so many that the stadium ran out by the third quarter.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons are {{a natural}} {{geographic}} rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only 230 miles (370 kilometers) south on I-85. The two teams have played each other {{twice a year}} since the Panthers' inception, and games between the two teams feature large contingents of Panthers <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> Atlanta's Georgia Dome.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} San Francisco 49–3 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs, then Washington 17–0 in the NFC Championship Game. The Giants {{advanced to}} play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the Rose Bowl. After falling behind 10–9 at halftime, they came back to beat the Broncos 39–20. Simms was named the game's MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} {{attended}} by 16,891 fans, who paid a total of $1,100,000 in admission fees. This represents less {{than one-third of the}} number of <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> WrestleMania VIII, which had an attendance of 62,167. The pay-per-view drew a 2.3 buyrate, which was lower than the previous year's 2.8 buyrate. It was higher, however, than the buyrates for any of the following four WrestleManias.|$|E

5|$|The team's cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats, a {{group of}} 24 women who lead cheers and {{entertain}} <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. The team's drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the social}} {{programs}} involved during the event were {{the opening ceremonies}} at the Tipsport arena. Included were musical performances from the English rock band Deep Purple, who performed at the opening ceremony 18 February, and the Slovak band Elán, who performed on 20 February. Concerts {{took place on the}} Liberec main square where medal award ceremonies occurred. In addition, there were special themed days, including Italian Day, Czech Day, Norwegian Day and Slovak Day. One recurring theme of this was free beer for people from these countries in some pubs at happy hour. The most famous <b>fans</b> <b>at</b> the championships were the Norwegians, who were very numerous compared with the other countries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT <b>fans.</b> <b>At</b> least {{as early as the}} 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E
