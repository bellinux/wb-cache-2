5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world,</b> Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{interests}} in human anatomy {{had a long}} tradition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world,</b> a forensic book such as Song Ci's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro's book in the 17th century. There have been several modern books published about Song Ci's writing and translations of it into English. This includes W.A. Harland's Records of Washing away of Injuries (1855), Herbert Giles' The Hsi Yuan Lu, or Instructions to Coroners (1924), and Dr. Brian E. McKnight's The Washing Away of Wrongs: Forensic Medicine in Thirteenth-Century China (1981).|$|E

50|$|Brezis {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} recruitment of elites and investigates {{the nature of the}} links between recruitment of elites and economic growth. The main change that occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> recruited its elites is that meritocracy became the basis for their recruitment. Although meritocratic selection should result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best being chosen, she shows that meritocratic recruitment actually leads to class stratification and auto-recruitment.|$|R
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world,</b> the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> in such forms as the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> described as the sexual revolution.|$|E

5|$|Croup is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world,</b> resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to become less {{prominent}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> {{starting in the}} late 20th century, allowing men {{to make their own}} choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E
