40|$|The {{extraction}} of cenospheres from fly ash {{and the study}} of their industrial applications have been extensively increased in the recent years. The efficient recovery of cenospheres without polluting the ash ponds or lagoons is a serious concern of the global community. Cenospheres of different density and particle sizes are now available in markets for various applications. The analysis of physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of cenospheres is important as these properties influence the quality of a product. This study finds that cenospheres exists in various densities and they vary in their physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. This research also incorporates the fabrication of a new <b>dry</b> <b>separator</b> system and subsequent modifications of the separator to extract cenospheres from fly ash. The dry method of separation of cenospheres from fly ash can be performed using a centrifugal air classifier. Several factors e. g., geometry and dimensions of the separation chambers, location and rate of the tangential air injection, speed of the rotor and the rate of feeding of sample are responsible for creating an appropriate air field inside the separation chamber for efficient separation. After several modifications, the {{extraction of}} cenospheres from fly ash is still a problem in the newly fabricated <b>dry</b> <b>separator</b> that needs further modification...|$|E

On {{the basis of an}} analysis of raw coal, the use of a compound <b>dry</b> <b>separator</b> is proposed in this paper to separate high-sulfur coal across the full size range of 80 - 0 mm. The effects of the vibration amplitude (A), frequency (f), and angle (0) on the separation results were systematically analyzed in this study. The results showed that when the high-sulfur coal was separated using the compound <b>dry</b> <b>separator</b> under the optimal vibration parameters off = 38 Hz, A = 2. 6 mm, and theta = 46. 5 degrees, the yields of the concentrate and tailings were 71. 24 % and 28. 76 %, respectively, with corresponding sulfur contents of 0. 93 % and 28. 59 %. The probable error (E) was 0. 145 with the largest degree of sulfur content segregation. Under these separation conditions, the acceleration at a clean coal segment increased by 58. 06 % compared with that at a gangue area; moreover, the material stratification at the clean coal segment was apparent, and the clean coal area was the main separation area. The stratification of dense material at the gangue area was poor, and the gangue area was mainly used to transport and discharge gangue. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The fundamental laws of magnetostatic fields are presented and the concept of magnetic potential energy is used to develop the expression for the force on a particle in a magnetic field. The forces which compete with the magnetic forces in <b>dry</b> magnetic <b>separators</b> are described.

30|$|The {{feed bin}} {{vibrating}} feeder controls the feed rate to the separating table. As ROM coal is {{introduced to the}} separation zone, a thick bed of particles forms on the vibrating deck. The heavier or high-density particles transport through the bed, comes {{in contact with the}} deck, and move toward the back plate {{under the influence of the}} inertia force generated due to deck vibration. Particles when strike the back plate, they move inward and upward in the direction of the discharge side of the table. During operation, lighter or low-density particles float on the top of the bed as they are pushed up at the back plate, and flow to the discharge point. As such, the lighter particles create an upper layer that is collected alongside the deck length. Particles of sufficient high-density sinks through the autogenous medium formed due to the bed of particles fluidized due to constant air-flow, and report back to the deck surface. These high-density particles are then forced by both vibration and the continuous influx of new feed material to transport in a helical pattern at the narrow end of the deck where the final reject is collected. Two or three products are collected from the front side of the table. For pilot-scale evaluation, a 5 -tph air-table deshaling unit utilizing a 1  m 2 air table was tested at three different test sites in India.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{segregation}} in particulate mixtures {{has long been}} considered as an annoying, and costly, feature encountered in many materials handling operations and although the onset is not clear, many {{believe it to be}} driven by the differences in particulate physical properties. An increasing number of usefully scaled laboratory and computer simulation investigations are being carried, particularly by the physics community, to help our understanding of this phenomenon. Physicists at the University of Nottingham have identified that through careful control of frequency and acceleration during vertical vibration, different types of particles can be positioned and/or segregated in a small rectangular cell. An extension of this work resulted in the design of a new small scale batch separator capable of recovering at least one separated particle layer in a different chamber. This work has explored the scale up of the small particle separator to operate in a semi-continuous mode. Since complete experimental know how of particle segregation phenomena is still deficient an empirical design strategy was used. This scaled up particle separator was driven by a pneumatically powered vertical vibration bench in which dry, non-cohesive particulate mixtures of varying densities and sizes (< 1000 µm) were vertically vibrated under different conditions to assess their separation behaviours. Experiments with regular (e. g. glass and bronze) and irregular shaped particle mixtures (e. g. comminuted glass and bronze) showed that lower magnitudes of vertical vibration frequency (30 ± 10 %), dimensionless acceleration (3 ± 10 %), particle bed heights (20 and 40 mm in majority of the investigated cases) and partition gap sizes (5 and 10 mm) were important for separation. Finally, the technique was employed to separate various industrially relevant particle mixtures (shredded printed circuit boards, iridium and aluminium oxide and shredded personal computer wires). Two-dimensional Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) with interstitial fluid interactions simulated with a maximum of 1000 virtual glass and bronze particles showed some important aspects of particle segregation such as; layered particle separation, high density particles ending on top and bottom of the particle bed, convection currents, particle bed tilting and partitioned particle separation. The application of Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) to glass, bronze, ilmenite and sand particles showed distinct trajectory maps in three dimension (X,Y and Z) with varying particle speeds in the vertically vibrated particle mixtures. The low density particles were mostly observed to move in the middle while the high density particles patrolled in the outer periphery of the separation cell. These distinct particle motions suggested that convection currents {{played an important role in}} controlling segregation. Furthermore, the application of a smoke blanket visualization technique showed the existence of air convection currents on top of the vertically vibrating particle mixtures. The experiments on the scaled up semi-continuous particle separator confirmed what was identified previously in that good particle separation could be achieved through careful control of the frequency and acceleration during vertical vibration. This information lays the foundations for a new breed of low cost, <b>dry</b> <b>separator</b> for fine particulate mixtures.

Instead {{they must be}} thought of as occurring in a susceptibility range where the bulk susceptibility is affected by present impurities. Inclusions or foreign atoms in solid solution may alter a materials magnetic properties to a large extent. Mixed particles of dia andlor paramagnetic materials display a linear relationship while ferromagnetic inclusions involve a demagnetisation factor. The susceptibility distribution of value minerals in relation to gangue in the ore is the most important factor governing magnetic separation performance. Until recently, high gradient and high intensity separators of matrix type were exclusively used in wet processing. Now, new <b>dry</b> <b>separators</b> are extending the particle range for dry, fine particle separation. The capture characteristics of the matrix has been shown to change with the magnetic field strength. The separation cut is more precise at high fields, at low fields the capture probability graph cants. By superimposing the capture function on the susceptibility distribution of an ore, it is shown that materials containing value minerals at either high or low susceptibility is ideal for HGMS separation. Complex ores carrying value and gangue minerals distributed over a wide susceptibility range are unfavourable. The former situation is common in industrial mineral processing and in the upgrading of flotation concentrates. The latter susceptibility distribution is very common in complex sulphide ore feeds.

Fly ash particles from both UK and Chinese coal-burning power stations were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (morphology and size), x-ray diffraction (crystallinity and minerals), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (elemental composition).

Hence, the {{need to consider the}} implementation of dry coal beneficiation methods as the industry cannot continue relying on the conventional wet processing methods such as heavy medium separation. Dry coal beneficiation with an air dense-medium fluidized bed is one of the dry coal processing methods that have proved to be an efficient separation method with separation efficiencies comparable those of the wet heavy medium separation process. Although the applications of the fluidized bed <b>dry</b> coal <b>separator</b> have been done successfully on an industrial scale, the process has been characterized by relatively poor (Ecart Probable Moyen), Ep values owing to complex hydrodynamics of these systems. Hence, the main objectives {{of this study is to}} develop a sound understanding of the key process parameters which govern the kinetics of coal and shale separation in an air fluidized bed focusing on the effect of the particle size, shape and density on the performance of the fluidized separator as well as developing a simple rise/settling velocity empirical model which can be used to predict the quality of separation. As part of this study, a (40 x 40 x 60) cm air fluidized bed was designed and constructed for the laboratory tests. A relatively uniform and stable average bed density of 1. 64 with STDEV < 0. 01 g/cm 3 was achieved using a mixture of silica and magnetite as the fluidizing media. Different particle size ranges which varied from (+ 9. 5 - 16 mm), (+ 16 - 22 mm), (+ 22 - 31. 5 mm) and (+ 37 - 53 mm) were used for the detailed separation tests. In order to investigate the effect of the particle shape, only three different particle shapes were used namely blockish (+ 16 - 22 mm Blk), flat (+ 16 - 22 mm FB) and sharp pointed prism particles (+ 16 – 22 mm SR). Different techniques were developed for measuring the rise and settling velocities of the particles in the bed. The Klima and Luckie partition model (1989) was used to analyze the partition data for the different particles and high R 2 values ranging from (0. 9210 - 0. 9992) were recorded. Average Ep iii values as low as 0. 05 were recorded for the separation of (+ 37 - 53 mm) and (+ 22 - 31. 5 mm) particles under steady state conditions with minimum fluctuation of the cut density. On the other hand, the separation of the (+ 16 - 22 mm) and (+ 9. 5 – 16 mm) particles was characterized by relatively high average Ep values of 0. 07 and 0. 11 respectively. However the continuous fluctuation or shift of the cut density for the (+ 9. 5 - 16 mm) made it difficult to efficiently separate the particles. Although, particle shape is a difficult parameter to control, the different separation trends that were observed for the (+ 16 - 22 mm) particles of different shapes indicate that particle shape has got a significant effect on the separation performance of the particles in the air fluidized bed. A simple empirical model which can be used to predict the rise/settling velocities or respective positions of the different particles in the air fluidized bed was developed based on the Stokes’ law. The proposed empirical model fitted the rise/settling data for the different particle size ranges very well with R 2 values varying from 0. 8672 to 0. 9935. Validation of the empirical model indicate that the model can be used to accurately predict the rise/settling velocities or respective positions for all the other particles sizes ranges except for the (+ 9. 5 – 16 mm) particles where a relatively high average...|$|R

Akışkanlaştırma karakteristiği belirlenmesinde boyutun etkisi araştırıldığında görülmüştür ki malzeme içinde küçük boyut miktarı arttığında hava hızı düşük olduğunda buyuk tanelerin hareketlenmesi ve tabakalanması engellenmekte, hava hızı fazla olduğunda ise ince taneler ayırma işlemine maruz kalmadan pnömatik taşınma ile sistemi terketmektedir [...] Dolayısıyla malzeme oldukça dar boyut gruplarına ayrılarak zenginleştirme yapılmasının daha etkili olacağı saptanmıştır. Bununla birlikte ürün boşaltma sisteminin akışkanlaştırma özellikleri ile kontrol edilebilirliği de bu tez çalışmasında incelenmiştir. Coal {{enrichment}} processes or so-called coal washing are usually done in water medium. A {{vast majority of}} washing processes are wet using the separation medium of water; so {{the amount of water}} used in such processes is considerable. As a result, there are problems in dewatering of both produced clean coal and tailings in economic and environmental terms. Moreover, flocculation agents in high dosage used in dewatering processes increase the production costs. In the light of these facts, {{there is a tendency to}} processing of coal in dry basis and thus researchers have started on this issue especially in countries such as China and Australia, and in cold countries where there is icing problems like Russia; in all these countries water resource problems are acute. There is a great deal of work to make the dry beneficiation of coal competitive with conventional wet beneficiation processes. It is important to reveal the applicability of this method in the utilization of Turkish coals. Some technological measures and online data collection systems as well as an optimum process design for specific coal types are required to make this competition realistic as the physical properties of coal and its associated minerals play a major role on the separation efficiency especially in dry coal processing. Dry beneficiation techniques for coal processing such as hand picking, optical or X-Ray sorting, crushing size classification (accelerator) air jigs, air tables, FGX technologies, Akaflow aerodynamic separator, Tribo-electrostatic separator, air-dense medium fluidized bed, electrostatic separation and etc. have many advantages over wet processes in terms of economic and environmental concerns. Pneumatic beneficiations such as air jigs and air-dense medium fluidized bed have been commercialized and being applied in many countries. The efficiency of these processes basically depend on the difference in characteristics of coal and gang minerals such as density, particle size, shape factors, magnetic and electro static susceptibility. In gravity based dry processing, stratification of coal is achieved through fluidizing and pulsating air, vibration and an oscillating deck in gravity based <b>dry</b> <b>separators.</b> There are a number of studies that show successful use of gravity based dry processing for coal cleaning indicating that dry beneficiation techniques can be well adapted to coals with different characteristics. In addition to coal processing, these dry processing methods are also open to beneficiation of different minerals such as sand, ferrous minerals, etc. or coal-like materials such as leonardite. In some applications, gravity based dry processing methods were also developed with modified system using different dense media such as sand, magnetite, magnetite fly ash, magnetic pearl and paigeite in separation of both inorganics, pyrite, and Hg. It was also reported that for the optimal separation of these impurities, using air table or fluidized bed separators, the operational parameters such as vibration amplitude, pulsation frequency, air volume, superficial air velocity, transverse angle, longitudinal angle and also coal properties like size and shape factor should be controlled carefully. Among these operational  parameters, pulsation frequencies and superficial air velocity were the most important in  governing the density based stratification and separation of the coal particles. In a fluidized bed system, a pack of solids is converted into a ﬂuidized bed by lifting action of air passing through it. Thus, three stages can be identiﬁed in the process of ﬂuidizing a bed of solids based on the velocity of air ﬂow through it; (i) ﬁxed or static bed, where the particles are in direct contact with each other, supporting each other's weight, (ii) expanded/ﬂuidized bed or particulate ﬂuidization where the particles have a mean free distance between particles and the particles are supported by the drag force of the ﬂuid, and (iii) mobilized bed. In fixed bed conditions, the particles remain in stationary contact whereas they are in free motion in a fluidized bed. When the fluid is passed upward through an unrestrained bed of particles, the bed will initially expand slightly to take up a loose packed arrangement. If the flow is increased, the pressure drop across the bed increases. Eventually the pressure drop equals the force of gravity on the particles (weight of the particles) and the particles begin to move. During this period, the porosity increases and the pressure drop rise more slowly than before due to the net effect of increased porosity and velocity. The bed is in extremely loose condition with the particles still in contact. The bed is unstable, the particles begin to lose contact and then adjust their position to present as little resistance to the flow as possible. With further increase on air velocity, the particles are separated and true or complete fluidization begins. By the time this position is reached, all particles are in motion and beyond that stiuation, the bed continues to expand and the particles move in a more rapid and independent motion. The pressure drop across the particles bed reaches a threshold, referred to as the point of incipient fluidization or minimum fluidization velocity. At that sitiution, all of the particles have been entrained in the fluid and pneumatic conveying exists. Dry beneficiation of the tested coals was performed through a Lab scale Allair Jig. Allair jig facility consisits of feed, separation (jigging) and powder filtering units. The fresh run of mine (ROM) coals were fed into a manual feed chute associated with belt conveyor and accumulated in the second feed chute where the feed rate was controlled by the stargates. Following the stratification of the feed in jigging cell by the fluidizing air from the fluidizing and pulsed air production and distribution mechanism towards the bottom part, the lighter coal particles floated and discharged automatically from the channel while the discharge of the dense materials through separated channel is controlled by the stargates by varying the rotational speeds. During stratification, a limited amount of powder is ventilated by the filter unit through the ventilation pipe. During the stratification, the operational conditions are adjusted by the control panel. On separation, pressure drops, Δp, for both part of the jigging cells were measured based on the fluidizing air rate by U-tube manometer to determine the minimum fluidizing air velocities, Umf, Umfa, Umf-cohesive. In this study, coal samples from Soma region of Turkey were used in the experiments. Coal samples of - 15, - 15 + 4, and - 15 + 1 mm in size were subjected to Allair jigging process. Samples of various moisture contents were cleaned in different pulsation amplitudes and air speeds. The effect of air speed on bedding and layering (fixed/fluid bed) and the impact of pressure difference was investigated. For each pulsation amplitude, particle size, and coal moisture content a minimum fluidizing air speed is introduced. In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed. The effect of air speed on bedding and layering (fixed/fluid bed) and the impact of pressure difference was investigated. For each pulsation amplitude, particle size, and coal moisture content a minimum fluidizing air speed was introduced. In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed. The effect of controlling product discharging system speed on bedding was also investigated in this study. The results obtained in this thesis have revealed that the negative effects arising from coal and device parametres on the separation efficiency would be brought to the minimum levels if the fluidization air velocity is set based on the variable conditions. It is also found that a controlled  product discharge/drainage system would be a possible feature for such an application, with a careful implementation of both fluidization characteristics and separation performance.

40|$|The {{concept of}} using a <b>dry,</b> density-based <b>separator</b> to achieve efficient, near-face rock removal, {{commonly}} referred to as deshaling, was evaluated in several applications across the U. S [...] Varying amounts of high-density rock exist in most run-of-mine feed. In the central Appalachian coalfields, a rock content exceeding 50 % in the feed to a preparation plant is commonplace due to high amounts of out-of-seam dilution made necessary by extracting coal from thin seams. In the western U. S, an increase in out-of-seam dilution and environmental regulations associated with combustion emissions have resulted in a need to clean low rank coals and dry cleaning may be the only option. A 5 ton/hr mobile deshaling unit incorporating a density-based, air-table technology commercially known as the FGX Separator has been evaluated at mine sites located within the states of Utah, Wyoming, Texas, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The FGX technology utilizes table riffling principles with air as the medium. Air enters through the table and creates a fluidized bed of particles comprised of mostly fine, high density particles. The high density particle bed lifts the low-density coal particles {{to the top of the}} bed. The low-density coal moves toward the front of the table due to mass action and the downward slope of the table. The high-density particles settle through the fluidized particle bed and, upon making contact with the table, moves toward the back of the table with the assistance of table vibration. As a result, the low-density coal particles exit the front of the table closest to the feed whereas the high-density, high-ash content particles leave on the side and front of the table located at the farthest from the feed entry. At each test site, the run-of-mine feed was either directly fed to the FGX unit or pre-screened to remove the majority of the - 6 mm material. The surface moisture of the feed must be maintained below 9 %. Pre-screening is required when the surface moisture of the feed coal exceeds the maximum limit. However, the content of - 6 mm in the feed to the FGX separator should be maintained between 10 % and 20 % to ensure an adequate fluidized bed. A parametric evaluation was conducted using a 3 -level experimental design at each test site to identify the optimum separation performance and parameter values. The test data was used to develop empirical expressions that describe the response variables (i. e., mass yield and product ash content) as a function of the operating parameter values. From this process, it was established that table frequency and longitudinal slope are the most critical factors in controlling both mass yield and clean coal ash while the cross table slope was the least significant. Fan blower frequency is a critical parameter that controls mass yield. Although the splitter positions between product and middling streams and the middling and tailing streams were held constant during the tests, a separate evaluation indicated that performance is sensitive to splitter position within certain lengths of the table and insensitive in others. For a Utah bituminous coal, the FGX separator provided clean coal ash contents that ranged from a low of 8. 57 % to a high of 12. 48 % from a feed coal containing around 17 % ash. From the 29 tests involved in the statistically designed test program, the average clean coal ash content was 10. 76 % while the tailings ash content averaged around 72 %. One of the best separation performances achieved an ash reduction from 17. 36 % to 10. 67 % while recovering 85. 9 % of the total feed mass, which equated to an ash rejection value of around 47 %. The total sulfur content was typically decreased from 1. 61 % to 1. 49 %. These performances were quantified by blending the middlings stream with the clean coal product. At a second Utah site, coal sources from three different bituminous coal seams were treated by the FGX deshaling unit. Three parameter values were varied based on the results obtained from Site No. 1 to obtain the optimum results shown in Table E- 1. Approximately 9 tests were performed on each coal source. The average ash content reductions were: Glenwal (= 25. 6 % to 8. 6 %), Pinnacle (= 17. 3 % to 9. 0 %) and Westridge (= 20. 6 % to 7. 5 %). Under optimum conditions, nearly 70 % of the high-density rock was rejected while recovering approximately 100 % of the 1. 60 float material. In the Powder River Basin, a small portion of the extracted coal is mistakenly diluted with out-of-seam rock. Since coal cleaning is not currently practiced, the diluted coal containing 20 %- 30 % ash is left in the pit as fill material, thereby representing a lost resource. A FGX test program conducted on the high ash sub-bituminous coal revealed the ability to produce clean coal containing 7 %- 8 % ash on a dry basis (5 %- 6 % on an as-received basis) with 62 % recovery.
