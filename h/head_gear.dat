Historians view that that Vivekananda visited the Swamithope Pathi {{during his visit to}} Kanyakumari in December 1892 and he was impressed by the principles behind rituals of this monistic faith, such as wearing a <b>head</b> <b>gear</b> during worship in temple, worshipping in front of mirror etc., and started wearing a turban from then on. Paulose suggests that Vivekananda received some spiritual instructions from the disciples of Ayya Vaikundar.|$|E
25|$|Common ways {{of getting}} concussions are any head to head hits or any hits that involve a hard blow to the skull. Every year nearly 135,000 {{children}} ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities. Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing <b>head</b> <b>gear</b> can help prevent concussions. Also wearing a frontal paid that protects the forehead and {{top of the head}} is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion. Wearing a mouth piece can help prevent concussions as well.|$|E
25|$|Hagler's next {{challenger}} was Sugar Ray Leonard, who {{was returning}} to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler {{a larger share of}} the purse Leonard obtained several conditions which would be crucial to his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds. Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no <b>head</b> <b>gear)</b> in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.|$|E

25|$|Yellow is {{the code}} for monks, mendicants and women. Minukka (radiant, shining) {{with a warm}} yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous {{feminine}} characters such as Sita, Panchali and Mohini. Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region. Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as Hanuman. Teppu are for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as Garuda, Jatayu and Hamsa who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories. Face masks and <b>head</b> <b>gear</b> is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colors have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.|$|E

A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both, the local driver {{and the person who}} filmed the video, have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official, although the exact government department is not known. The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013, also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai in bad light. The parody video was shot in areas of Satwa and depicted gangs learning how to fight using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc.|$|E

He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E

500|$|Other {{insignia}} {{include the}} processional cross, the mitre and the crosier. Eastern traditions favor {{the use of}} their own style of <b>head</b> <b>gear</b> and crosier, {{and the use of the}} mantle or cloak rather than the ecclesiastical hat. The motto and certain shapes of shields are more common in ecclesiastical heraldry, while supporters and crests are less common. The papal coats of arms have their own heraldic customs, primarily the Papal Tiara (or mitre), the keys of Saint Peter, and the ombrellino (umbrella). Pope Benedict XVI replaced the use of the Papal Tiara in his coat of arms with a mitre. He was the first pope to do so, despite the fact that Pope Paul VI was the last pope to be crowned with the tiara. [...] The arms of institutions have slightly different traditions, using the mitre and crozier more often than is found in personal arms, though there is a wide variation in uses by different churches. [...] The arms used by organizations are called impersonal or corporate arms.|$|E
500|$|Kumaritashvili's death raised {{concerns}} about athlete safety at the Winter Olympics. As of 21 February 2010, there were 30 crashes in bobsleigh and luge at the Sliding Centre. Debate was raised on tightening qualification standards in weeding out unqualified athletes, in requiring {{a large number of}} training runs, in slowing down the sliding tracks, or in combining the three. The Russian National Sliding Centre planned for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events at the 2014 Winter Olympics has not been built though organizers already said that it is designed to be [...] slower than The Whistler Sliding Centre. Sochi's Sliding Centre will be monitored via 3-D computer graphics and simulation. The IOC has improved safety standards over the years such as lowering obstacles for the equestrian three-day event, requiring protective <b>head</b> <b>gear</b> for boxing and ice hockey, and tightening qualification standards to preclude athletes not qualified for the event. FIBT President Storey wanted to wait to review safety of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton until after the 2010 Games, stating that track designers needed to find a balance between challenges and dangers on the track. Track designer Gurgel told Sport Bild that perhaps track walls should be raised [...] on future courses though a risk-proof course may not be possible. According to VANOC, over 30,000 runs were made prior to the games with neither the FIBT nor the FIL issuing public danger warnings about the track. IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that he [...] "will do everything in my power that this should not happen again in the future".|$|E

2500|$|The {{running backs}} coach for Vanderbilt before {{accepting}} the head coaching position at Oklahoma in 1932, Lewie Hardage played football {{as well as}} baseball for the Commodores. During his tenure at OU, he developed a lightweight football uniform consisting of foamed rubber <b>head</b> <b>gear,</b> knee pads and shin guards along with pants that ended three inches above the knee. This gear weighed approximately eight pounds, half of what the old style had weighed. He also built OU's fastest all-weather football field in his time. For much of his tenure at OU, Hardage suffered from sickness that resulted from accidentally swallowing a poison tablet his mistook for a headache tablet. Only 12 players attended spring practice in 1932, but running back Bill Pansze kept the Sooners up 3-0 {{for the first half}} of the season. A knee injury in the Texas game took Pansze out for the remainder of the season and severely slowed the OU running game. [...] "The same wolves who had harassed Ad Lindsey, began to yip at Hardage's heels" [...] because of the Sooners' poor running and blocking. Hardage was fired as head coach of the Sooners after the 1934 season. His final record at OU was 11-12-4.|$|E

He had at his back a satchel, which seemed to contain a few necessaries, a hawking gauntlet on his left hand, though he carried no bird, and in his right a stout hunter's pole. Over his left shoulder hung an embroidered scarf which sustained a small pouch of scarlet velvet, such as was then used by fowlers of distinction to carry their hawks' food, and other matters belonging to that much admired sport.

The most recently marketed pegs of this sort use planetary gears designed to fit inside a case shaped like a friction peg, and have seen some adoption as they require no more modification of the instrument than a new set of friction pegs and make fine tuners unnecessary.|$|R
