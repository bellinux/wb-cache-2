5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had <b>German</b> <b>measles,</b> chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E

25|$|The MMR vaccine (also {{known as}} the MPR vaccine after the Latin names of the diseases) is an {{immunization}} vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles).</b> It {{is a mixture of}} live attenuated viruses of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck.|$|E
25|$|On 15 October 1941, Gregg {{delivered}} a paper, Congenital Cataract following <b>German</b> <b>Measles</b> in the Mother, to the Ophthalmological Society of Australia in Melbourne which published {{it in its}} journal, Transactions. Following press coverage of his paper, Gregg was contacted by two mothers who had contracted rubella, and whose children suffered from deafness, and he subsequently issued a further paper detailing Further Observations on Congenital Defects in Infants following Maternal Rubella.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Cordero, {{whose work}} has been {{published}} in many national and international journals, has promoted the eradication of Rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles),</b> {{a major cause of}} birth defects that can be prevented through vaccination. He has also promoted research to determine the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities, and has promoted efforts to prevent serious birth defects (such as use of folic acid to prevent Spina Bifida). He is a strong supporter of programs that promote wellness of persons with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|In June 1943, while {{pregnant}} with Daria, Tierney contracted rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles),</b> likely from a fan ill with the disease. Daria was born prematurely in Washington, DC, weighing three pounds, two ounces (1.42kg) and requiring a total blood transfusion. The rubella caused congenital damage: Daria was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely mentally disabled. She was institutionalized {{for much of}} her life. This entire incident was inspiration for a plot point in the 1962 Agatha Christie novel The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side.|$|E
25|$|The swollen glands or {{lymph nodes}} can persist {{for up to}} a week and the fever rarely rises above 38°C (100.4°F). The rash of <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> is {{typically}} pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red papules on the area of the soft palate.|$|E

25|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infection caused by the measles virus. Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Two or {{three days after the}} start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads {{to the rest of the}} body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles)</b> and roseola are different diseases.|$|E
25|$|The VICP {{covers all}} {{vaccines}} {{listed on the}} Vaccine Injury Table maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; in 2007 the list included vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles),</b> polio, hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), Haemophilus influenzae type b, rotavirus, and pneumonia. From 1988 until 8 January 2008, 5,263 claims relating to autism, and 2,865 non-autism claims, {{were made to the}} VICP. 925 of these claims, one autism-related (see previous rulings), were compensated, with 1,158 non-autism and 350 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled $847 million. The VICP also applies to claims for injuries suffered before 1988; there were 4,264 of these claims of which 1,189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million.|$|E
25|$|When World War II began, Gregg was a {{paediatric}} ophthalmologist, at a {{time when}} most doctors had joined the army and he was one of few eye doctors in Sydney. Gregg noticed a high incidence of congenital cataracts in infants arriving at his surgery – two to three times the normal rate that would be expected from hereditary factors. He overheard a conversation between several mothers whose babies had cataracts, in which they mentioned that they had suffered from <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> (rubella) during pregnancy. Investigating the medical records of children with similar conditions, Gregg discovered that out of 78 affected children, 68 had been exposed to rubella in utero. There had been an outbreak of rubella and meningitis in Australian army camps in 1941, which had been transmitted to the wider community when the men returned to their families.|$|E
25|$|Rubella, {{also known}} as <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> or three-day measles, is an {{infection}} caused by the rubella virus. This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|According to {{author and}} former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, neither crew could [...] "be classed {{in a very}} high standard", {{claiming}} Cambridge's selection was poor and Oxford's coaches indecisive. Ten days before the race, Oxford's W. S. Llewellyn was struck down by <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> {{and was replaced by}} A. M. Hankin who was placed at stroke.|$|E
500|$|During the Apollo 13 crisis, Lunney {{played a}} key role. Coming on shift {{an hour after the}} oxygen tank {{explosion}} that put the crew's lives in jeopardy, Lunney and his team faced the unprecedented challenge of having to power up the lunar module on an extremely tight timeline, while transferring guidance and navigation data to it from the dying command module. His excellent memory and quick thinking were critical in the success of his team during the ensuing hours. Ken Mattingly, the astronaut who had been bumped from the Apollo 13 crew due to his exposure to <b>German</b> <b>measles,</b> later called Lunney's performance [...] "the most magnificent display of personal leadership that I’ve ever seen". On the day following the Apollo 13 splashdown, Lunney joined his fellow flight directors in accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom {{as a member of the}} Apollo 13 mission operations team. The award was made by President Nixon during a ceremony at the Manned Spacecraft Center.|$|E
2500|$|Rubella, {{otherwise}} known as <b>German</b> <b>measles,</b> was also very common {{before the advent of}} widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is in pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected, her baby may contract congenital rubella from her, which can cause significant congenital defects.|$|E
2500|$|Duke was backup Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 13, however {{shortly before}} the mission he caught <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> from a friend's child and {{inadvertently}} exposed the prime crew to the disease. [...] As Ken Mattingly had no natural immunity to the disease, Mattingly was then replaced as Command Module Pilot by Jack Swigert. [...] Mattingly would be reassigned as Command Module Pilot of Duke's flight, Apollo 16.|$|E
2500|$|Immunization {{to prevent}} polio, diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), {{pertussis}} (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (<b>German</b> <b>measles),</b> Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B), and Hepatitis B {{are provided by}} the county health departments. [...] A certificate of immunizations, known as the “blue slip,” is required for entry into all day care centers, Head Start, and {{public and private schools}} through grade 12. [...] Vaccinations for adults for measles, pneumonia, tetanus, flu, and other diseases, including those required for overseas travel are also available.|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{passed the}} far side of the Moon at an {{altitude}} of [...] above the lunar surface, and 400,171km (248,655mi) from Earth, a spaceflight record marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth. [...] The mission was commanded by James A. Lovell with John L. [...] "Jack" [...] Swigert as Command Module Pilot and Fred W. Haise as Lunar Module Pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot Ken Mattingly, who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to <b>German</b> <b>measles.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rubella, {{synonymous with}} <b>German</b> <b>measles,</b> {{is a disease}} caused by a virus with the same name and is highly contagious. [...] It is often combated using {{preventative}} measures, typically through vaccination. [...] For children and adults it can be overcome quite easily once vaccinated, however, if the fetus is exposed to the virus, especially during the first trimester (the {{first three months of}} pregnancy), major implications can occur. [...] Rubella, in a pregnant woman, can lead to autism or autistic-like symptoms and congenital rubella syndrome for her offspring after birth. [...] It is essential {{to keep in mind that}} this is not conclusive and still remains a theory. Congenital rubella syndrome has many adverse effects such as: mental retardation, meningitis and encephalitis. [...] The latter two ailments also affect cognition and learning capacities.|$|E
2500|$|During her {{pregnancy}} with her last child, Marijke Christina, Princess Juliana contracted <b>German</b> <b>measles.</b> The girl {{was born in}} 1947 with cataracts in both eyes and was soon diagnosed as almost totally blind in one eye and severely limited in the other. Despite her blindness, Christina, as she was called, was a happy and gifted child with a talent for languages and an ear for music. Over time, and with advances in medical technology, her eyesight did improve such that with thick glasses, she could attend school and even ride a bicycle. However, before that happened, her mother, the Princess, clinging to any thread that offered some hope for a cure, came under the strong influence of Greet Hofmans, a faith healer with heterodox beliefs, who was considered by [...] "her many detractors" [...] to be a sham.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} epidemic of rubella in Australia. Subsequently, ophthalmologist Norman McAllister Gregg found 78 cases of congenital cataracts in infants and 68 of them were born to mothers who had caught rubella in early pregnancy. Gregg published an account, Congenital Cataract Following <b>German</b> <b>Measles</b> in the Mother, in 1941. He described a variety of problems now known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and noticed that the earlier the mother was infected, the worse the damage was. Since no [...] vaccine was yet available, some popular magazines promoted the idea of [...] "German measles parties" [...] for infected children to spread the disease to other children (especially girls) to immunize them for life and protect them from later catching the disease when pregnant. The virus was isolated in tissue culture in 1962 by two separate groups led by physicians Parkman and Weller.|$|E

6000|$|MORELL. Scarlatina!--rubbish, <b>German</b> <b>measles.</b> I {{brought it}} into the house myself from the Pycroft Street School. A parson is like a doctor, my boy: he must face {{infection}} as a soldier must face bullets. (He rises and claps Lexy on the shoulder.) Catch the measles if you can, Lexy: she'll nurse you; and what a piece of luck that will be for you!--eh? ...|$|E
60|$|To {{the birds}} {{this was a}} very poor reason, but the older ones felt {{grateful}} to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the <b>German</b> <b>measles,</b> and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite. So six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it; and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Remember mumps,' {{he warned}} her almost threateningly, and off he went again. 'Mumps one pound, {{that is what}} I have put down, but I daresay {{it will be more}} like thirty shillings--don't speak--measles one five, <b>German</b> <b>measles</b> half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don't waggle your finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings'--and so on it went, and it added up {{differently}} each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.|$|E
6000|$|But {{social science}} {{is by no}} means always content with the normal human soul; it has all sorts of fancy souls for sale. Man as a social idealist will say [...] "I am tired of being a Puritan; I want to be a Pagan," [...] or [...] "Beyond this dark {{probation}} of Individualism I see the shining paradise of Collectivism." [...] Now in bodily ills there is none of this difference about the ultimate ideal. The patient may or may not want quinine; but he certainly wants health. No one says [...] "I am tired of this headache; I want some toothache," [...] or [...] "The only thing for this Russian influenza is a few German measles," [...] or [...] "Through this dark probation of catarrh I see the shining paradise of rheumatism." [...] But exactly the whole difficulty in our public problems is that some men are aiming at cures which other men would regard as worse maladies; are offering ultimate conditions as states of health which others would uncompromisingly call states of disease. Mr. Belloc once said that he would no more part with the idea of property than with his teeth; yet to Mr. Bernard Shaw property is not a tooth, but a toothache. Lord Milner has sincerely attempted to introduce German efficiency; and many of us would as soon welcome <b>German</b> <b>measles.</b> Dr. Saleeby would honestly like to have Eugenics; but I would rather have rheumatics.|$|E
