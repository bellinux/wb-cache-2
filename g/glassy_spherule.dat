40|$|Two new HED meteorites are described. GRA 98108 is an olivine-bearing diogenite at the Mg-rich {{end of the}} diogenite clan. GRA 98030 is a howardite with 30 % eucritic and 70 % diogenitic clasts, and {{contains}} an MgO-rich and CaO- and Al 2 O 3 -poor <b>glassy</b> <b>spherule.</b> Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract...|$|E
40|$|Textural features, <b>glassy</b> <b>spherule</b> and glassy {{aggregate}} contents, and size-frequency {{distributions of}} lithic {{components of the}} regolith fines indicate that the Fra Mauro regolith of the smooth terrain is a highly reworked accumulation of debris derived primarily by impact comminution of annealed breccias. Analyses of the glassy spherules suggest that mare-derived debris must amount to less than 5 % of the regolith, but exotic materials having {{the composition of the}} Fra Mauro breccias (highland-like) cannot be recognized. Breccia samples from the Fra Mauro site include (1) regolith breccias derived by lithification of local regolith material, (2) texturally and compositionally unique white rock breccias that may have been derived from ancient ejecta buried beneath the Fra Mauro formation, and (3) annealed breccias that are excavated samples of the Fra Mauro formation. The latter were deposited as heated impact ejecta, probably by avalanches produced by the Imbrian event and were annealed in situ in a thermal regime perhaps equivalent to that responsible for the pyroxene-hornfels facies of metamorphism in terrestrial rocks...|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of the last hundred years, {{microscopic}} magnetite and <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> of different genesis (extraterrestrial, volcanic, industrial, biogenic, diagenic, explosive, etc.) have often been found in various geo-logical formations. Alongside classical geological methods, research into extraterrestrial and explosive spherules can provide valuable information and facilitates stratigraphical correlations over large areas. Several authors have recently stressed that studies on cosmic- and impact-related micro-spherules may seriously be hampered by outcrop- and laboratory contamina-tion. Fly-ash particles and steel slags resembling iron-rich cosmic spheres are the most frequently invoked industrial contaminants. In contrast, little attention has been paid to <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> of industrial origin that might resemble microtektites. Our finding of lechatelierite inclusions in obvious industrial provenance might cast serious doubts of the validity of the classical « Lechatelierite Criterion » as a test for impact glasses...|$|R
40|$|The morphological, mineralogical, and {{chemical}} characteristics of silicate and <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> {{from a number}} of new localities in the Transantarctic Mountains were determined. The results indicate that these Antarctic spherules are of extraterrestrial origin. It is concluded that they, most likely, represent individual micrometeorites that melted during passage through the atmosphere; alternatively, they may be ablation spherules...|$|R
50|$|The high {{temperatures}} {{created by the}} impact’s force fused sediments into small <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules.</b> Spherules of 3.5 billion years old exist in South Africa and spherules of a similar age {{have been found in}} Western Australia, they are the oldest-known terrestrial impact products. The <b>spherules</b> resemble the <b>glassy</b> chondrules (rounded granules) in carbonaceous chondrites, which are found in carbon-rich meteorites and lunar soils.|$|R
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules,</b> shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Magnetic spherules were {{systematically}} {{collected and}} investigated from Pleistocene terrestrial sediment in Southern Hungary. By the chemical analysis: Fe, Fe(Mn), Fe(Ni) and <b>glassy</b> (silicate) <b>spherules</b> can be distinguished. Some {{of them have}} characteristic feature suggested extraterrestrial origin: Ni-bearing crust, Ni-rich core and especially platinum group nuggets with unique chemical composition. Their formation can be a meteorite ablation process...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, Martian soil {{measured}} at six different landing sites shows homogeneity amongst its main chemical components. However, {{there are also}} regional and trace components in Martian soil, such as carbonate, chlorohydrocarbon, and <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> identified at the Gale Crater (Blake et al. 2013; Leshin et al. 2013; Minitti et al. 2013). In situ measurements of soil samples indicate that Martian soil contains approximately 43 – 45 wt% SiO 2, 16 – 20 wt% FeO, 7 – 10 wt% Al 2 O 3, 6 – 9 wt% MgO, 6 – 8 wt% CaO, 0.7 – 0.9 wt% P 2 O 5, and 5 – 8 wt% SO 3 (Banin et al. 1992; Foley et al. 2003; Gellert et al. 2004; Rieder et al. 2004; Blake et al. 2013). As shown in Table  1, compared to Martian soil, JMSS- 1 has higher levels of SiO 2 (49.28 wt%) and Al 2 O 3 (13.64 wt%) {{and lower levels of}} SO 3 and P 2 O 5 (0.3 wt%).|$|R
30|$|As shown here, {{observations}} of the radioactive plume over Tsukuba at different times demonstrated that the 89 Sr/ 90 Sr ratio was almost constant, but the 137 Cs/ 90 Sr ratio and the extraction efficiency of 137 Cs with nitric acid differed. Moreover, it was shown earlier that the activity ratios among other γ-emitters differed (see Appendix 1). These findings confirm that {{the characteristics of the}} aerosol particles that carried major radionuclides from the first plume differed from later advected radioactive plumes. Adachi et al. (2013) addressed this sort of contrast in the characteristics of the two plumes’ radioactive aerosols in detail, and Abe et al. (2014) added more information. They documented the discovery of insoluble, <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> containing radioCs and assumed that the major fraction came from the first event. Indeed, no such particles were detected in the later event. This should also affect the ratio of 137 Cs/ 90 Sr in the air, and evidence regarding this will be obtained in future work. In conclusion, the present results support the previous findings of less 90 Sr contamination than radioCs contamination from the FDNPP accident and indicate the necessity of further investigations of radioSr in the atmospheric environment.|$|R
40|$|The Late Devonian, and in {{particular}} the Frasnian-Famennian (F/F) boundary, records one of the five largest mass extinctions in the fossil record. <b>Glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> believed to be of impact origin are associated with the F/F boundary in two Belgian sections (Senzeille and Hony). They have also been reported in sediments deposited approximately 1. 5 to 2 m. y. above the boundary in south China, and in the Canning Basin (Australia) this event coincides with a 300 pg/g Ir anomaly. In this study, the F/F boundary in the Hony section was analyzed for trace and major elements to test the possibility of an Ir anomaly associated with the spherule layer. No significant positive Ir anomaly was detected in the 2 m of section investigated. Nevertheless, chalcophile elements show an increase within the dark shale bed marking the F/F boundary. This increase is interpreted to represent a reduction in oxygen concentrations in the depo-sitional environment. This level must be equivalent to {{the upper part of the}} Kellwasser anoxic event recognized throughout the paleo-Tethys in what is now western Europe. The F/F boundary seems to be marked by a succession of major events, including impact, oxygen-depleted water on the shelf, and worldwide extinction of organisms.

40|$|Electron {{microprobe}} {{examination revealed}} that glassy lunar fragments had inclusions {{as well as}} boundaries between mineral glasses of different compositions. <b>Glassy</b> lunar <b>spherules</b> showed detectable heterogeneity less marked {{than that of the}} fragments. The room-temperature refractive indices and densities of the spherules are changed by heat-treating them at 500 to 700 C. The large increases (as much as 2 % in density and 0. 7 % in index of refraction) are difficult to explain on the basis of classical glass-transition phenomena alone unless extremely rapid cooling rates are assumed. Further, the spherules darkened significantly when they were heated in air or a medium vacuum above 625 C...|$|R
40|$|Cosmic spherules {{are unique}} igneous objects that form by melting due to gas drag heating during {{atmospheric}} entry heating. Vesicles {{are an important}} component of many cosmic spherules since they suggest their precursors had finite volatile contents. Vesicle abundances in spherules decrease through the series porphyritic, glassy, barred, to cryptocrystalline spherules. Anomalous hollow spherules, with large off-centre vesicles occur in both porphyritic and glassy spheres. Numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vesicles during atmospheric flight is presented that indicates vesicles rapidly migrate due to deceleration and separate from non-porphyritic particles. Modest rotation rates of tens of radians s- 1 are, however, sufficient to impede loss of vesicles and may explain the presence of small solitary vesicles in barred, cryptocrystalline and <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules.</b> Rapid rotation at spin rates of several thousand radians s- 1 are required to concentrate vesicles at the rotational axis and leads to rapid growth by coalescence and either separation or retention depending on the orientation of the rotational axis. Complex rapid rotations that concentrate vesicles in the core of particles are proposed as a mechanism for the formation of hollow spherules. High vesicle contents in porphyritic spherules suggest volatile-rich precursors, however, calculation of volatile retention indicates these have lost > 99. 9 % of volatiles to degassing prior to melting. The formation of hollow spherules, by rapid spin, necessarily implies pre-atmospheric rotations of several thousand radians s- 1. These particles are suggested to represent immature dust, recently released from parent bodies, in which rotations have not been slowed by magnetic damping...|$|R
40|$|The geochemical {{nature of}} the impactites from International Continental Scientific Drilling Project-El'gygytgyn lake drill core 1 C is {{compared}} with that of impact melt rock fragments collected near the western rim of the structure and literature data. Concentrations of major and trace elements, with special focus on siderophile metals Cr, Co, Ni, and the platinum group elements, and isotope ratios of osmium (Os), were determined to test the hypothesis of an ureilite impactor at El'gygytgyn. Least squares mixing calculations suggest that the upper volcanic succession of rhyolites, dacites, and andesites were the main contributors to the polymict impact breccias. Additions of 2 - 13. 5 vol% of basaltic inclusions recovered from drill core intervals between 391. 6 and 423. 0 mblf can almost entirely account for the compositional differences observed for the bottom of a reworked fallout deposit at 318. 9 mblf, a polymict impact breccia at 471. 4 mblf, and three impact melt rock fragments. However, the measured Os isotope ratios and slightly elevated PGE content (up to 0. 262 ng g(- 1) Ir) of certain impactite samples, for which the CI-normalized logarithmic PGE signature displays a relatively flat (i. e., chondritic) pattern, can only be explained by the incorporation of a small meteoritic contribution. This component is also required to explain the exceptionally high siderophile element contents and corresponding Ni/Cr, Ni/Co, and Cr/Co ratios of impact glass spherules and spherule fragments that were recovered from the reworked fallout deposits and from terrace outcrops of the Enmyvaam River approximately 10 km southeast of the crater center. Mixing calculations support the presence of approximately 0. 05 wt% and 0. 50 - 18 wt% of ordinary chondrite (possibly type-LL) in several impactites and in the <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules,</b> respectively. The heterogeneous distribution of the meteoritic component provides clues for emplacement mechanisms of the various impactite units...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> {{found in}} the lunar {{regolith}} {{can be used to}} investigate the volcanic and impact history of the Moon. Here we report the first study combining petrography with microbeam geochemical data for major-element, trace-element and Pb isotopic compositions of individual spherules that were separated from a sample of regolith collected at the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the Moon. Petrographic characteristics of 216 spherules were established by optical and electron microscopy. About half of these spherules show obvious evidence of formation by meteorite impacts into the lunar regolith, such as relict clasts, schlieren, vesicles, FeNi metal blebs, irregular shapes and heterogeneous nucleation textures. The remaining spherules have textures indicating rapid quenching of melt droplets, including clast-free glass and microcrystalline to vitrophyric textures. These were produced by either impact melting or volcanic fire fountaining. Chemical compositions of clast-poor spherules were determined by electron microprobe and laser ablation ICPMS, and the provenance of each spherule was classified as either feldspathic highlands, mare or mixed highlands-mare. Spherules with feldspathic highlands compositions are droplets of impact melt that provide a regional-scale sampling of regolith and rock compositions {{in the vicinity of the}} landing site. A group of picritic, high-TiO 2 mare spherules has a limited range of major and trace-element compositions similar to the famous Apollo 17 orange glass; these are likely to be volcanic in origin. A small number of mare spherules with very low Ti (VLT) and unusually aluminous compositions were also found. We tentatively conclude that the VLT spherules reflect igneous compositions, whereas the aluminous mare spherules are likely to be impact mixtures. We also conducted a reconnaissance LA-ICPMS study of Pb isotopic compositions and U-Th-Pb concentrations to investigate the feasibility of dating individual spherules. 207 Pb/ 206 Pb model ages and U-Th-Pb chemical ages of the picritic mare spherules are similar to those of the 3. 8 - 3. 5 Ga Apollo 17 mare basalts, consistent with an igneous origin for the glasses. In contrast, impact spherules have systematically younger chemical ages (≤ 2 Ga). About half of the impact spherules appear to be ≤ 500 Ma, consistent with the recent discovery of a young spike in the spherule age populations at other landing sites. The abundance of relatively young ages with a predominantly local provenance suggests that most of the impact spherules were produced by small impact events, perhaps related to craters ≤ 1 km in diameter...|$|R

It may be equivalent to sediment recovered from other sites containing beds with spikes of cosmic nuclides and charcoal indicating the presence of widespread fire, one of the signatures of the Black Mat conflagration that followed the proposed breakup of Comet Encke or an unknown asteroid over the Laurentide Icesheet at 12. 9 ka.

40|$|Howardite meteorites are polymict breccias {{composed}} {{mainly of}} eucritic and diogenitic material that likely originate {{from the surface}} of the Asteroid 4 Vesta. They can be separated into two subtypes: Regolithic, which represent the lithified remains of the active vestan regolith; Fragmental, which represent simpler polymict breccias. Amongst the regolithic features observed in the former, melt clasts are particularly striking for their appearance and compositional variability. They range from <b>glassy</b> <b>spherules</b> to finely crystalline (i. e., devitrified) clasts, and clasts containing only relict mineral grains to those containing only phenocrysts. Glasses can be separated into compositional sub-types including those with low FeO/MgO ratios (less than 5) -low alkali glasses, K-rich (K 2 O greater than 0. 2 wt. %), Na-rich (Na 2 O greater than 0. 6 wt. %) and CaO-rich, and those with high FeO/MgO ratios (greater than 10). There is also a distinction to be made between primary volcanic melt clasts and those produced by impacts. While suggested that a lack of chemical homogeneity among their studied melt clasts ruled out a primary volcanic origin, the low siderophile element contents observed in such clasts suggest less compositional influence from impactors than commonly assumed. Studying the chronology of the impact melt clasts in howardites can help us to better determine the timing of impact events on Vesta and the asteroid belt. In this research, we are launching an investigation into the petrology, composition (major/trace element and noble gas) and chronology of melt clasts in howardites. We have selected a set of howardites known to contain large quantities of melt clasts, and have begun the petrological and compositional studies of these materials. Once the melt clasts have been fully classified, we aim to perform chronological studies of individual clasts using both the Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 and Pb-Pb chronometers, as well as determine the noble gas components present. Of particular note, the study will take advantage of the laser ablation techniques associated with the noble gas facilities at ASU, which will allow high-resolution, in-situ analysis of individual clasts. The broader aim of this work is to ascertain whether the impact flux in the region of the asteroid belt was similar to that on the Moon. Our understanding of impact events in the inner Solar System relies heavily on our analyses of lunar meteorites and returned samples, and there is currently some debate regarding whether there was a "Lunar Cataclysm" event around approx. 3. 9 Ga, or the end of an epoch of "Late Heavy Bombardment" (LHB) at this time. New and more comprehensive constraints on howardite melt clast ages may help determine whether the asteroid belt experienced such a cataclysm or LHB...|$|R
