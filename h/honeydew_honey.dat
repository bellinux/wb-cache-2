40|$|Honey adulterations can {{be carried}} out by {{addition}} of inexpensive sugar syrups, such as high fructose com syrup (HFCS) and inverted syrup (IS). Carbohydrate composition of 20 honey samples (16 nectar and 4 <b>honeydew</b> <b>honeys)</b> and 6 syrups has been studied by GC and GC-MS in order to detect differences between both sample groups. The presence of difructose anhydrides (DFAs) in these syrups is described {{for the first time in}} this paper; their proportions were dependent on the syrup type considered. As these compounds were not detected in any of the 20 honey samples analyzed, their presence in honey is proposed as a marker of adulteration. Detection of honey adulteration with HFCS and IS requires a previous enrichment step to remove major sugars (monosaccharides) and to preconcentrate DFAs.

40|$|Honey {{is greatly}} {{appreciated}} by consumers {{not only for}} its nutritive properties and sweet taste, but also for its pleasant aroma. Different unifloral, multifloral and <b>honeydew</b> <b>honeys</b> are marketed nowadays, and their characterization for authentication purposes or to increase their added value represents a challenge for the analyst. Honey aroma is dependent on its volatile composition, which in turn is influenced by the nectar or honeydew collected by bees as well as by beekeeping practices, processing and storage conditions, etc. The high resolution and sensitivity provided by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) make of this technique the tool of choice for the analysis of the complex mixtures of volatiles of different functionality, and usually present at very low concentrations, in honey. However, GC-MS analysis of honey volatiles requires a previous step in which these compounds are extracted from non-volatile honey matrix. Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) {{has been shown to be}} a simple, rapid and affordable technique for the extraction and preconcentration of honey volatiles (1). Furthermore, the selectivity of SPME extraction can be modulated by the fiber coating selected (2). On the other hand, the development of non-separative approaches based on mass spectral fingerprints is recently gaining wide attention for the rapid and unbiased classification of food samples (3). However, up to date, they have scarcely been applied for the characterization of honey source (4). The objective of this work was to evaluate and compare the performance of two approaches for the characterization of honey source: (i) in the ‘conventional approach’, multivariate statistical analysis was applied to semiquantitative data gathered by SPME GC-MS. A total of 40 commercial honeys of 13 different sources were analyzed (1) using two different SPME fiber coatings (polyacrylate and carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane). (ii) In the ‘mass spectral fingerprint approach’, after corresponding data pretreatment (removal of interferences and normalization), chemometrics was applied to combined MS spectra of volatiles sampled by SPME. Classification of <b>honeydew</b> <b>honeys</b> and of several unifloral honeys (citrus, eucalyptus, rosemary and acacia) was possible by both approaches. However, mass to charge ratios and volatiles pointed out as markers of honey source in the first and second approaches, respectively, were only sometimes related. Similar conclusions were obtained irrespective of the SPME fiber coating considered. To conclude, the usefulness of both SPME GC-MS and SPME-MS approaches for the classification of honey source has been proved. References: (1) Soria AC, Martínez-Castro I, Sanz J. (2003).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} the determination of the total content of Cu, Pb and Zn by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry with atomization in an air-acetylene flame in Polish honeys samples. The research material was a <b>honeydew,</b> monofloral <b>honey</b> and buckwheat honey. For the mineralization of samples, the following solutions were applied:  1) HNO 3 (conc), 2) HNO 3 (conc) and H 2 O 2 (conc)  in the volume ratio equal to 4 : 1 and 3 : 1. On the basis of the results and recommended food standards the percentage of the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) in connection with the consumption of 100 g of product were estimated. To verify the results validation of analytical method used was carried out. It was included defining the following validation parameters values: the limit of detection and quantification; linearity and measurement range; repeatability and accuracy of the results. The contamination of the analyzed honeys by Pb is higher than the acceptable level of contamination of this element. The highest contents of Cu and Zn were characterized by monofloral honeys...|$|R
40|$|Thirty honey samples (18 monofloral, 6 multifloral and 6 honeydew) were {{collected}} directly from apiaries localized in the South-Eastern Poland. Monosaccharide profiles (glucose/fructose ratio) in honey were examined by HPLC method with ELSD-detection. The results {{were compared with}} other parameters used in honey sugar analysis, i. e. a level of reducing sugars measured by Lane-Eynon, sugar extract (refractometric), specific rotation angle and glucose content determined with Reflectoquant® test (Merck). Moreover, some physicochemical parameters such as: water content, free acids and HMF content by White method were tested. The content of monosaccharides determined by HPLC (as sum of glucose and fructose) and Lane-Eynon methods were compared (r= 0. 83) and changed from 68 % in rape honey to 78 % on average in goldenrod honey. All studied honeys showed the ratio of fructose/glucose above 1. 5. The measurement of the specific optical rotation allowed to distinguish nectar (-) and <b>honeydew</b> (+) <b>honey,</b> but due to the heterogeneity of the results, {{they could not be}} used for identification of the floral honeys. The results of reflectometric test for glucose level were positively correlated with values measured by HPLC method (r= 0. 73) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Honeydew, the sugary exudate of {{the scale}} insect Ultracoelostoma brittini, is an {{important}} food source in black beech (Nothofagus solandri var. solandri) forests in the South Island of New Zealand. Two {{of the most prominent}} foragers of <b>honeydew</b> are <b>honey</b> bees (Apis mellifera) and wasps (Vespula germanica and V. vulgaris). Observations in the field and using a captive bee hive were used to investigate competition between bees and wasps feeding on honeydew. In laboratory trials, interference competition was often strong, and many cases of aggression were noted. In the forest, there was invariably enough room on the trees for bees and wasps to feed while rarely encountering one another. Over the whole year, environmental variables (especially low temperatures and rain), were found to constrain honey bee foraging to a greater degree than competition with wasps. Because the competition that did occur was primarily exploitation competition, reciprocal effects were likely to be felt. At Coopers Creek, bees may be reducing wasp densities, compared with the situation in Nelson- Marlborough where commercial hives are scarce. It may be possible to reduce wasp densities locally by increasing the number of bee hives in an area...|$|R
