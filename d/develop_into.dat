5|$|Other merozoites <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are}} the precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|In the Iazyges' early {{relationship}} with Rome, {{they were used}} as a buffer state, being between the Romans and the Dacians.

Throughout this relationship, the Iazyges still continued their raids on Roman land, which often caused punitive expeditions to be made against them.|$|E

50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, {{the female}} gametophyte (sometimes {{referred to as}} the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> an embryo inside the ovule. The ovule in turn <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a seed and in many cases the plant ovary <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows into a seedling.|$|R

High-resolution and real-time AFM phase imaging enables us to observe the detailed growth process of lamellae. During the early stage of crystallization, embryos appear and disappear on the film surface. A stable embryo <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a single lamella, which <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a founding lamella. Then, the founding lamella <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a lamellar sheaf through branching and splaying.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100°E are officially {{named by the}} Japan Meteorological Agency when they become tropical storms. However, PAGASA also names tropical cyclones that occur or <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> tropical depressions within their self-defined area of responsibility between 5°N–25°N and 115°E-135°E. This often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two names.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the workers}} of more {{advanced}} social insects such as honeybees, bumblebee workers are fertile, and can lay unfertilised haploid eggs (with {{only a single}} set of chromosomes) that <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> viable male bumblebees.

5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E

5|$|A second, {{far smaller}} storm cell passed along a similar {{route to the}} first {{later in the evening}} of 14 April.

Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
