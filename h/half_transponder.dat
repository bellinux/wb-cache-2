5000|$|In <b>half</b> <b>transponder</b> mode, the {{frequency}} deviation of the composite baseband signal {{is reduced to}} 18 MHz to allow another signal in {{the other half of}} the 36 MHz transponder. This reduces the FM benefit somewhat, and the recovered SNRs are further reduced because the combined signal power must be [...] "backed off" [...] to avoid intermodulation distortion in the satellite transponder. A single FM signal is constant amplitude, so it can saturate a transponder without distortion.|$|E
