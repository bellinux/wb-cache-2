25|$|Vitamin A, or retinol, is {{the sole}} vitamin which is <b>embryotoxic</b> even in a {{therapeutic}} dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, the retinoic acid, {{plays an important role}} as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs. Its natural precursor, the β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophile vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamine A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women, and that the patient is aware of {{how important it is to}} prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamine A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as mental retardation.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{inhibitory}} {{effects in}} phosphatases, okadaic acid has shown promise {{in the world}} of medicine for numerous potential uses. During its initial discovery, okadaic acid, specifically the crude source extract, showed potent inhibition of cancer cells, and so initial interest in the family of molecules tended to center around that feature. However, it was shown that the more cytotoxic component of H. Okadai was actually a separate family of compounds, the Halichondrines, and as such research into the cytotoxicity of okadaic acid decreased. However, the unique function of okadaic acid upon cells maintained biological interest in the molecule. Okadaic acid has been shown to have neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and <b>embryotoxic</b> effects. Furthermore, in two-stage carcinogenesis of mouse skin, the molecule and its relatives have been shown to have tumor promoting effects.

Cadmium is known to be present in the environment due to industrial and consumer waste entering into aquatic and terrestrial systems, and has a very long half-life of around thirty years. It is also genotoxic, meaning it builds up in the kidneys and liver, thus accumulating in the food chain.

Sera from some rats immunized with laminin were <b>embryotoxic,</b> while others were not <b>embryotoxic.</b> Antilaminin antibody levels in these rats could not predict toxicity, however toxic sera was found to recognize different epitopes on laminin than the nontoxic sera. ^ As the monkeys in the original study had naturally occurring antibodies to laminin, the role of antilaminin autoantibodies in embryotoxicity was examined. Injection of mercuric chloride into Brown Norway rats {{has been found to}} induce autoimmune glomerulonephritis that produced autoantibodies to laminin. In the present study, sera from Brown Norway treated with mercuric chloride were tested in culture and were associated with embryotoxicity and embryolethality. Affinity purified antibodies from these rats were also found to cause embryotoxicity in a dose dependent manner. ^ Using laminin immunized monkey sera, the mechanisms of antilaminin antibody embryotoxicity was found to involve the antilaminin antibodies binding to the cell surfaces of the visceral yolk sac. This binding was found to cause reductions in the number of microvilli on the cell surfaces that in turn reduced the uptake of nutrients. Methionine supplementation was found to overcome the toxicity of sera from one monkey and not the other. This was linked to the level of antibody binding to the yolk sac. As epitope specificity of antilaminin antibodies were found to distinguish toxic and non-toxic sera, monkeys were immunized with four characterized laminin peptides, YIGSR, RGD, IKVAV and a peptide of no known function. Sera from the YIGSR and RGD immunized monkeys were <b>embryotoxic</b> and these monkeys could not reproduce successfully. Again toxicity was related not to antilaminin antibody levels but to yolk sac binding. This suggested that toxicity of antilaminin antibodies was related to the exposure of laminin epitopes in the yolk sac. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} thesis was {{to study}} gene expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation in embryonic stem cells and to establish molecular markers for <b>embryotoxic</b> substance effects after selection of appropriate candidate genes. The work {{was conducted on the}} basis of the Embryonic Stem Cell Test (EST), an alternative method to animal experiments, which is intended for the prediction of an <b>embryotoxic</b> potential of substances (Spielmann et al., 1997). The EST is based on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells of the mouse (line D 3). Their ability to form contracting cardiomyocytes within 10 days of development is used as a model of embryonic development. During the differentiation period the expression of 18 genes with a known in vivo function in early mesoderm or heart differentiation was studied by means of quantitative RT-PCR. This selection contained heart muscle specific genes of the contractile apparatus alpha-MHC, beta-MHC, MLC 1, MLC 2 v, alpha-Actin, alpha-Actinin and Troponin T, transcription factors of early mesodermal and heart development GATA- 4, Tbx 5, Hand 1 and 2, MesP 1 and 2, as well as myocardin, the cytokine cardiotrophin- 1, the growth factor cripto- 1 and, in addition, genes, which are not heart specific (Oct 4 and NF L). During the differentiation of D 3 cells to cardiomyocytes, the majority of gene specific transcripts was found in patterns that were in accordance with their expression in vivo. The expression of important transcription factors like MesP 1 and 2 as well as Hand 1 and 2 was determined during in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation in D 3 cells for the first time. In order to establish molecular markers for a prediction of <b>embryotoxic</b> effects on the level of gene expression, the genes MesP 1 and MLC 1 were chosen as test candidates, whose expression was determined after substance treatment at appropriate time points (MesP 1 on day 5; MLC 1 on day 7 and in addition on day 10). In substance tests with 11 substances with known <b>embryotoxic</b> potential in vivo and two substances without comprehensive in vivo data, it could be shown that the sensitivity of the molecular markers was comparable with the conventional microscopic endpoint in the majority of cases. An analysis of the results of the 11 known substances with all four endpoints using a mathematic model which was developed for the prediction of an <b>embryotoxic</b> potential (Genschow et al., 2002) lead in all but two single tests to the correct classification. Thus, out of the molecular markers that were established successfully, two lead to a correct prediction of the <b>embryotoxic</b> potential of the substances even earlier than the conventional endpoint. The results of the presented work contribute to understanding the succession of molecular events during in vitro differentiation of cardiomyocytes and, therefore, to improve the possibilities of the EST to be applied as a screening test for <b>embryotoxic</b> effects in early substance development. The results allow to shorten the test duration and with the use of molecular endpoints automation of parts of the test procedure becomes possible. Furthermore, the fact that an early mesodermal gene like MesP 1 allowed a correct <b>embryotoxic</b> prediction shows that the presented results can contribute to the selection of genes, which can be used as molecular markers for a wider choice of differentiation processes...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} indicates that several chemicals whose reduced metabolites are capable of undergoing redox cycling in biological systems also possess significant teratogenic properties when tested in vivo. We have initiated investigations {{to determine whether the}} <b>embryotoxic</b> effects of such chemicals could result from their redox cycling properties and whether redox cycling could be an important mechanism in chemical teratogenesis. In order to obviate the potentially confounding influences of maternal factors, our initial studies have been performed with a whole embryo culture system with redox cycling agents added directly to the culture medium. Several representative redox cycling agents including doxorubicin, paraquat, a series of nitroheterocycles, nitrosofluorene, and diethylstilbestrol (converted metabolically to redox cycling quinone/semiquinone radicals) have been investigated thus far. The nitroheterocycles which bear nitro groups with comparatively high redox potentials produced a striking, asymmetric defect involving primarily the right half of the prosencephalic and mesencephalic regions. The effect was exacerbated under conditions of low 02 tension. Accumulated data to date strongly suggest that reduction of the nitro group is an essential feature in the <b>embryotoxic</b> mechanism. Quinones (doxorubicin, paraquat) and compounds metabolically converted to quinones (diethylstilbestrol) appeared to produce <b>embryotoxic</b> effects via mechanisms not associated with redox cycling. Nitrosofluorene embryotoxicity was markedly exacerbated by changes in both intra- and extracellular glutathione levels, but definitive dependence on a radical-mediated effect or redox cycling was not demonstrated...|$|E
