50|$|A {{provost marshal}} is a title {{given to a}} person {{in charge of a}} group of {{military}} police (MP). The title originated with an older term for military police, provosts. While a provost marshal is now usually a senior commissioned officer, he/she may be a person of any rank, who commands any number of MPs; historically, the title was sometimes applied to civilian officials, especially under conditions of martial law, or when a military force had day-to-day responsibility for some or all aspects of civilian law enforcement (such as some British colonies). A Provost marshal may also oversee security <b>services,</b> <b>imprisonment,</b> fire/emergency <b>services</b> and ambulances.|$|R

5000|$|Leather's novels {{frequently}} include {{themes of}} crime, <b>imprisonment,</b> military <b>service,</b> and terrorism. Settings are typically London and the Far East. Leather writes different series in slightly different genres. The main character of one series, Dan 'Spider' Shepherd, {{is a former}} Special Air Service soldier who becomes an undercover policeman.

50|$|In December 1894, Nāwahī {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the Republic on charges of treason. He was acquitted and released, but died, on September 14, 1896, from {{tuberculosis}} contracted during his <b>imprisonment.</b> His funeral <b>services</b> in Honolulu and Hilo were attended by supporters and friends; even his former enemies {{and the government of}} the Republic acknowledged his important contributions as a Hawaiian patriot.|$|R
60|$|At {{that time}} the army {{was held in the}} {{greatest}} dislike by the English people. The nation had always been opposed to a standing force, and it was only now that the necessities of the country induced them to tolerate it. It was, however, recruited almost entirely from reckless and desperate men. Criminals were allowed to commute sentences of <b>imprisonment</b> for <b>service</b> in the army, and the gates of the prisons were also opened to insolvent debtors consenting to enlist. But all the efforts of the recruiting sergeants, aided by such measures as these, proved insufficient to attract a sufficient number of men to keep up the armies at the required strength.|$|R
50|$|The Penal Code (1965) {{does not}} {{specifically}} address domestic violence, which is prosecuted under the common assault {{provisions of the}} Code.

5000|$|Although the Bearden ruling {{required}} that the defendant in a case regarding not paying court fines can only be imprisoned if they [...] "willfully" [...] chose not to pay them, the Court did not define what [...] "willfully" [...] meant in this context. This has frequently led to judges having to determine whether someone who did not pay a fine was too poor to do so or not. Some attorneys with many poor clients {{have argued that the}} requirement in Bearden that judges consider a defendant's ability to pay is almost never enforced. In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Kevin Thompson, who had spent five days in a Georgia jail for not paying a traffic ticket, arguing that Bearden was intended to prevent just such situations from happening. Thompson's lawyer also claimed that the court did not consider alternatives to <b>imprisonment,</b> like community <b>service,</b> as required by Bearden.|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Bryan became good at preaching {{that a lot}} {{of people}} were showing up to his {{services}} in the village of Yamacraw. The white community did not like that there were a lot of african american people gathering for Bryan's services. The slave masters did not want their slaves listening to Bryan because they believe that he was plotting a rebellion. The slaves that did attend the services were harassed by whites. The slaves were whipped, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, and <b>imprisonment.</b> The church <b>services</b> were interrupted constantly by the whites. Bryan was accused for plotting of a rebellion so he was beaten and thrown in jail. Sampson was also thrown jail along with Bryan. Jonathan Bryan and other plant owners protested the arrest of Andrew Bryan. The case was analyzed by Justice of the Inferior Court of Chatham County and it resulted in Bryan and Samson being innocent and released. After they were released, Bryan went back preaching at Jonathan Bryan's barn from sunrise to sunset.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, {{the city}} of Chicago adopted an anti-loitering law (Chicago Municipal Code 8-4-015 (1992)) aimed at restricting gang related activity, {{especially}} violent crime and drug trafficking. The law, which defined loitering as [...] "remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose", gave police officers a right to disperse such persons and in case of disobedience, provided for a punishment by fine, <b>imprisonment</b> and/or community <b>service.</b> It was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court of the United States (Chicago v. Morales, [...] ) as unacceptably vague and not giving citizens clear guidelines on what the acceptable conduct was. In 2000, the city adopted a revised version of the ordinance, {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the unconstitutional elements. Loitering was then defined as [...] "remaining in any one place under circumstances that would warrant a reasonable person to believe that the purpose or effect of that behavior is to enable a criminal street gang to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities." ...|$|R
40|$|The Palestinian Authority {{is under}} {{obligation}} to observe {{international human rights}} standards relating to children {{in conflict with the}} law. However, the authority has done little to improve the juvenile justice system. Children are treated in accordance with rules that have been drafted to suit past generations. The system lacks resources, trained police, prosecutors, judges, and probation officers. Yet the environment to reform the system is enabling. There are foundations to set up modern alternatives to <b>imprisonment,</b> including community <b>service,</b> alternative families, and restorative justice. The main problem in Palestine is not the law, though important, but rather the allocation of resources and adoption of reform policies. Nothing in the law precludes the Ministry of Social Affairs opening new juvenile rehabilitation centres or to give more powers to probation officers. Nothing prevents the High Judicial Council setting up a specialised juvenile judiciary. The Attorney General can establish juvenile prosecution. The police could open specialised juvenile unites. Civil society organisations are able to provide legal aid and conduct training courses on restorative justice and on socio-psychological issues. Most reform steps can be taken on a functional basis through executive instructions from relevant official bodie...|$|R
40|$|Desde sua criação, os Juizados Especiais Criminais vêm sendo caracterizados como espaços institucionais marcados pela rápida distribuição de punições alheias ao cárcere, entre as quais se destacam a prestação de serviços à comunidade e as sanções monetárias. Essa agilidade apoia-se na utilização de acordos estabelecidos entre promotores e suspeitos de crimes reputados como leves. Este artigo descreve a etnografia desses acordos, selados em audiências nesses juizados, possibilitando a verificação dos significados específicos atribuídos a essas punições quando articuladas a um sistema de trocas cuja finalidade é evitar o processo judicial.   Since their {{creation}} the Brazilian Magistrates’ Court have been characterized as institutional spaces typi­fied by the swift distribution of punishments other than <b>imprisonment,</b> including community <b>service</b> and fines.

The article Management, Time, Work, and Suffering: The Economy of Pu­nitive Exchanges Based on an Ethnography of Magistrates’ Courts describes the ethnography of these agreements, made at hearings at these courts, enabling the specific meanings attributed to these punishments to be verified when engaged in an ex­change system that aims to avoid judicial proceedings.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyse}} the Indonesian Supreme Court (Mahkamah Agung) {{decisions}} to the defendants of substance misuse. The data {{were based on}} the Supreme Court decisions for substance misuse cases from 2001 - 2009, uploaded in putusan. mahkamahagung. or. id. The database consists of 191 cases involving 218 defendants. Logistic regression and Tobin’s logistic regression (Tobit) were used in this study to estimate the probability and the intensity of various disposals. This is inline with Becker (1968) argument that the optimal deterrence effect of a disposal arose from the probability of conviction and the intensity of punishment. 	 The types of punishment sentenced to defendants of substance misuse cases are vary, ranging from <b>imprisonment,</b> fines, community <b>service,</b> probation and even a capital punishment. The results from logistic regression analyses showed the social costs of substance misuse was used by the Supreme Court judges to consider the value of fines sentenced to offenders. the social cost that is inflicted by the defendant was only weighed in giving fines to the defendant. On the other hand, the results from Tobit regressions showed that the Supreme Court judges did not taken into consideration the social cost of substance misuse in determining the intensity of punishment sentenced to defendants. The explicit social cost caused by the defendants of the narcotics/psychotropics case was Rp 23. 7 billion (about US$ 2. 37 million), however the fines charged by the Supreme Court was only Rp 5. 5 billion (about US$ 550, 000). Further investigation showed that the defendants who were sentenced to pay fines by the District Courts has 51. 7 % more probability to be sentenced with imprisonment by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, results from Tobit regressions showed that the longer the imprisonment sentenced by the District Court, the more fines were sentenced to the defendants by the Supreme Court. ...|$|R
