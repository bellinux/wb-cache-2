25|$|<b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|For cyanide poisoning, a {{large amount}} of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> may be given {{intravenously}} and sometimes in combination with sodium thiosulfate. The mechanism of action is straightforward: the hydroxycobalamin hydroxide ligand is displaced by the toxic cyanide ion, and the resulting harmless B12 complex is excreted in urine. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved (in 2006) the use of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> for acute treatment of cyanide poisoning.|$|E

50|$|The {{literature}} {{data on the}} acute toxicity profile of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> show it is {{generally regarded as safe}} with local and systemic exposure. The ability of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> to rapidly scavenge and detoxify cyanide by chelation has resulted in several acute animal and human studies using systemic <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> doses at suprapharmacological doses as high as 140 mg/kg to support its use as an intravenous (IV) treatment for cyanide exposure. The US FDA at the end of 2006 approved the use <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> as an injection for the treatment of cyanide poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Cobalamins are {{characterized}} by a porphyrin-like corrin nucleus that contains a single cobalt atom bound to a benzimidazolyl nucleotide and a variable residue (R) group. The variable R group {{gives rise to the}} four most commonly known cobalamins: CNCbl, methylcobalamin, 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and OHCbl. In the serum, <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> and cyanocobalamin are believed to function as storage or transport forms of the molecule, whereas methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the active forms of the coenzyme required for cell growth and replication. Cyanocobalamin is usually converted to <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> in the serum, whereas <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is converted to either methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin. Cobalamins circulate bound to serum proteins called transcobalamins (TC) and haptocorrins. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> has a higher affinity to the TC II transport protein than cyanocobalamin, or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. From a biochemical point of view, two essential enzymatic reactions require vitamin B12 (cobalamin).|$|E

50|$|For most, the {{standard}} therapy {{for treatment of}} vitamin B12 deficiency has been intramuscular (IM) injections {{in the form of}} cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) or <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> (OHCbl). Cyanocobalamin is traditionally prescribed in the United States. Outside of the United States, <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is most generally used for vitamin B12 replacement therapy and is considered the “drug of choice” for vitamin B12 deficiency by the Martindale Extra Pharmacopoeia (Sweetman, 2002) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Drugs. This preference for <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> in many countries is due to its long retention in the body and the need for less-frequent IM injections in restoring vitamin B12 (cobalamin) serum levels. Furthermore, IM administration of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases; vitamin B12-deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia due to cyanide poisoning; and patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, a form {{of vitamin}} [...] called <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is often {{produced}} by bacteria and was then changed to cyanocobalamin during purification in activated charcoal columns after separation from the bacterial cultures. This change was not immediately realized when vitamin [...] was first extracted for characterization. Cyanide is naturally present in activated charcoal. <b>Hydroxocobalamin,</b> which has affinity for cyanide, {{picks it up and}} changes to cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is the form in most pharmaceutical preparations because adding cyanide stabilizes the molecule.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> acetate {{occurs as}} odorless, dark-red {{orthorhombic}} needles. The injection formulations appear as clear, dark-red solutions. It has a distribution coefficient of 1.133 × 10-5 and a pKa of 7.65.|$|E
5000|$|In pernicious anemia, autoantibodies {{directed}} against parietal cells or intrinsic factor cause {{a reduction in}} vitamin B12 absorption. It can be treated with injections of replacement vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin, <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> or cyanocobalamin).|$|E
50|$|Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), {{which is}} also known as {{cobamamide}} and dibencozide, is, along with methylcobalamin (MeCbl), one of the active forms of vitamin B12. It is available as a nutritional supplement, along with cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and <b>hydroxocobalamin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sodium thiosulfate {{has been}} {{considered}} as an empirical treatment for cyanide poisoning, along with <b>hydroxocobalamin.</b> It is most effective in a pre-hospital setting, since immediate administration by emergency personnel is necessary to reverse rapid intracellular hypoxia caused by the inhibition of cellular respiration, at complex IV.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxocobalamin,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin B12a and hydroxycobalamin, is vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat vitamin B12 deficiency including pernicious anemia. Other uses include cyanide poisoning, Leber's optic atrophy, and toxic amblyopia. It is given by injection into a muscle or vein.|$|E
50|$|If {{exposure}} is suspected, the {{person should be}} removed from the source of exposure and decontaminated. Treatment involves supportive care and giving the person 100% oxygen. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> (vitamin B12a) appears to be useful as an antidote and is generally first line. Sodium thiosulphate may also be given. Historically cyanide has been used for mass suicide and by the Nazis for genocide.|$|E
5000|$|A set of {{chemicals}} may be (but is not always) grouped under an alphabetized vitamin [...] "generic descriptor" [...] title, such as [...] "vitamin A". Other examples of vitamers include cyanocobalamin, <b>hydroxocobalamin,</b> methylcobalamin, and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (adenosylcobalamin—AdoB-12), {{which are all}} vitamers of B12, and thus all possess [...] "B12 activity". Another example is that both niacinamide and nicotinic acid (niacin) have vitamin B3 activity.|$|E

50|$|Side {{effects may}} include vomiting, joint pain, mood changes, psychosis, and ringing in the ears. Safety; however, {{has not been}} well studied. It is unclear if use in {{pregnancy}} is safe for the baby. Use {{at the same time}} in the same intravensous line as <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> is not recommended. In cyanide poisoning sodium nitrite creates methemoglobinemia which removes cyanide from mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate then binds with cyanide creating the nontoxic thiocyanate.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{standard}} cyanide antidote kit first uses a small inhaled dose of amyl nitrite, {{followed by}} intravenous sodium nitrite, followed by intravenous sodium thiosulfate. <b>Hydroxocobalamin</b> is newly approved in the US {{and is available}} in Cyanokit antidote kits. Sulfanegen TEA, which could be delivered to the body through an intra-muscular (IM) injection, detoxifies cyanide and converts the cyanide into thiocyanate, a less toxic substance. Alternative methods of treating cyanide intoxication are used in other countries.|$|E
5000|$|Due to its remote nature (approximately 197 km {{from the}} nearest town, Pickle Lake, Ontario) safety is a major priority. An air {{ambulance}} may take upwards of 2 or more hours to transport an injured worker to Thunder Bay, due to this time factor and the general health of the 300-500 workers at the site an Occupational Health Nurse is on site and trained {{in the treatment of}} any foreseen incident, such as the administration of sodium thiosulfate and <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> in the event of cyanide poisoning. In addition the mine was the first gold mine in Canada to sign the International Cyanide Management Code. All who may work in areas where contact with cyanide is a possibility are required to undergo treatment training for cyanide poisoning, due to the speed which cyanide can kill a victim prompt first aid treatment with amyl nitrite is essential until the victim can be treated with injections of sodium thiosulfate and <b>hydroxocobalamin.</b> The [...] "Musselwhite mine" [...] surface repair shops are also home to a tire cage large enough to handle the tires from the CAT 990 loader or any comparable large tire when maintenance is required on them.|$|E
50|$|In a newly {{diagnosed}} vitamin B12-deficient patient, normally defined as when serum levels {{are less than}} 200 pg/ml, daily IM injections of <b>hydroxocobalamin</b> up to 1,000 μg (1 mg) per day are given to replenish the body’s depleted cobalamin stores. In the presence of neurological symptoms, following daily treatment, injections up to weekly or biweekly are indicated for six months before initiating monthly IM injections. Once clinical improvement is confirmed, maintenance supplementation of B12 will generally be needed for life.|$|E
