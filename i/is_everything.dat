5|$|According to verse 18, she is venerated because Devi {{is eight}} {{attendant}} deities of Indra ("Vasus"); the eleven Rudras; and the twelve Adityas or sun gods representing each month of a year. She represents all gods who consume the Vedic ritual drink Soma {{or those who}} choose not to. She is also all the goblins, the demons, the evil beings, the ghosts, the super-human and the semi-divine, the planets, stars and all that shines in the sky, she is time and its divisions, she <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> that was, is and {{will be in the}} universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Evreinov {{argued that}} the role of theatre was to ape and mimick nature. In his estimation, theatre <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> around us. He pointed out that nature is full of {{theatrical}} conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence.|$|E

It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E

25|$|La danse (Bacchante) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54cm (28.75 by 21.25 in). The work represents a nude {{woman in a}} composition that contains {{a wide variety of}} exotic geometrized elements. Metzinger's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in Bacchante. His brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving rhythm to the overall work. The depth of field is flattened; the foreground blending in with background components. The subject matter is classical—reminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (an artist Metzinger greatly admired)—yet its treatment <b>is</b> <b>everything</b> but classical.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She <b>is</b> <b>{{everything}}</b> that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

We kind of spent a day saying, 'Can we do this? <b>Is</b> <b>everything</b> going to be okay?' And she was fine, so we figured that would be a fun, fraught thing to happen between Jack and his mom, especially right before Christmas." ...|$|E
