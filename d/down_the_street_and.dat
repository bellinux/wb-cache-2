A slum {{clearance}} scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents rehoused in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes.

Trainor was also an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier {{and a member of the}} Orange Order. A seriously wounded pensioner, Henry Miller (79) would die in hospital on 5 April.

500|$|Directed by both Usher {{and music}} video {{director}} Chris Robinson, [...] "My Boo" [...] clip was filmed in New York City. The storyline {{of the video}} {{is a reflection of}} the song's lyrics. The footage starts with Usher in a living room watching a video for [...] "Bad Girl", a song from Confessions. The [...] "Bad Girl" [...] intro features Usher singing the song in a club setting while admiring a scantily-dressed woman. He turns the set off and slumps down on the sofa before laying on it with his foot propped up. After a moment of silent, nostalgic reflection, he begins to sing the intro of [...] "My Boo". The video then shows him and Alicia Keys in their separate quarters, preparing to head out, while singing their part of the song. Usher eventually steps out on streets of New York; likewise, Keys is out in her car. She leaves the car and walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> the couple meet up in the middle of Times Square, cuddling each other and on the brink of kissing. The music video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine on September 16, 2004. It remained on the countdown for twenty-seven days, becoming the only Confession video to chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Want You" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, who previously directed Jackson's music videos for [...] "All for You" [...] and [...] "Just a Little While". It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out of my apartment building and walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood."

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish {{a little girl in}} the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was my message in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance." [...] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolises [...] "innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
500|$|Walden {{demanded that}} whoever was {{responsible}} be terminated; as a result, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, and Tuffy Phillips all were fired. [...] "That was a culmination of everything falling apart.... They were {{a symptom of}} the problem—not the problem itself," [...] said Perkins. The band again joined the Grateful Dead and the Band in July at Watkins Glen Speedway in New York's Finger Lakes region, for what was then deemed the largest rock concert ever. 150,000 tickets were sold, but the crowd expanded to nearly 600,000, causing it to be declared a disaster area. People abandoned their cars and walked up to ten miles to attend the concert. The jam between the three bands was later called [...] "garbage" [...] by Trucks, as all involved were under the influence of various substances, including alcohol, cocaine, and LSD. To promote the release of the album, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert program staged an episode set in Macon, taping performances from the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. Betts walked offstage midway through the performance, with Walden chasing him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> urging him to return. [...] "Walking off the stage was a first for me. It was like, 'Dude, what are you doing? We're all brothers here. If there's a problem, let's talk about it,'" [...] said Leavell.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios. It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers. The video ends as Brown spins, stops and looks off into the distance.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
