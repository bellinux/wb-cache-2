40|$|Production of {{vanillin}} {{from natural}} <b>green</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods {{was carried out}} by enzyme-assisted extraction combined with pre-freezing and thawing. In the first step the <b>green</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods were pre-frozen and then thawed to destroy cellular compartmentation. In the second step pectinase from Aspergillus niger was used to hydrolyze the pectin between the glucovanillin substrate and β-glucosidase. Four main variables, including enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time and pH, which were of significance for the vanillin content were studied and a central composite design (CCD) {{based on the results of}} a single-factor tests was used. Response surface methodology based on CCD was employed to optimize the combination of enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time, and pH for maximum vanillin production. This resulted in the optimal condition in regards of the enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time, and pH at 84. 2 mg, 49. 5 °C, 7. 1 h, and 4. 2, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the experimental yield of vanillin was 4. 63 % ± 0. 11 % (dwb), which was in good agreement with the value predicted by the model. Compared to the traditional curing process (1. 98 %) and viscozyme extract (2. 36 %), the optimized method for the vanillin production significantly increased the yield by 133. 85 % and 96 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans were {{subjected}} to the traditional curing process in Mexico. Odor-active potential from beans including 23 compounds was monitored through the analysis of both free and glucosidically bound volatiles. 8 of them were aliphatic aldehydes, acids, alcohol and ketone. 15 molecules were shikimate derivatives in which 13 were detected in glucosylated form. Some glucosides were efficiently hydrolyzed while some others partly {{or not at all}} after 90 days of curing. Moreover kinetics of hydrolysis of glucosides were not the same. A major part of glucovanillin was hydrolyzed at the first stages of curing while some other glucosides at the advanced stages. Data support hypothesis that hydrolysis of glucosides during curing is rather enzymatic origin than chemical one. Free shikimate derivatives or those liberated from glucosides are prone to chemical or enzymatic interconversions leading to a significant change in the aroma profile of cured vanilla.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{high prices}} for vanilla {{on the world}} market have led various countries to establish or revive vanilla production. Madagascar, the world s leading producer of vanilla (Vanilla fragrans), {{has not been able to}} contain the sky-rocketing prices, since the government liberalised the sector in 1995 and abolished fixed price levels. Now producers are in danger of losing part of their market share to competitor countries. At present, the country produces around 1, 200 MT of cured vanilla annually, while the total worldwide output of cured vanilla is around 2, 200 MT. Curing is a six-month process, during which the <b>green</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans are first exposed alternately to moist and dry heat for 20 days, after which the beans are slowly dried to enhance and bring out their well-known flavour in the familiar form of a vanilla stick. Vanilla fragrans is regarded to yield the best or Bourbon quality, which is preferred for foodstuffs, like ice, cakes, chocolate and drinks. Vanilla tahitensis (South Pacific), V. java (Indonesia) and V. pompona (West Indies), yield vanillas that are used for flavouring tobacco, soaps, perfumes and medicines. The average price for <b>green</b> <b>vanilla</b> in 2001 has been around 20 /kg, which in 2000 was 13 /kg and in 1999 only 4 /kg. Prices for cured vanilla amount to approximately t 160 /kg for 2002, so eight times more than green beans fetch. The steep price increase is also driving importers and processors to look for alternatives, both for the product as for the producers. Bioprocessing methods have been developed to harvest more fragrance per unit of cured vanilla and synthetic vanilla is being mixed with, or replacing natural vanilla. Nothing beats the real thing, though, and importers are actively looking for new producers. India and China have taken up vanilla production, but their first vanilla will not reach the market before 2003. Small wonder that last season vanilla growers in Tonga were surprised by eight visiting vanilla buyers, offering 22. 50 per green kilo. Tonga produces between 35 t and 40 t of bourbon vanilla annually.

40|$|Introduction. The {{traditional}} curing {{of vanilla}} pods includes "killing" and sweating steps when pods {{are exposed to}} heat (35 - 65 degrees C) for various lengths of time. Although {{it is known that}} liberation of vanillin and other phenolics from their non- aromatic glucosides is due to the action of an endogenous beta-glucosidase, its in vivo kinetics remained unknown. Materials and methods. Mature <b>green</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods were pretreated for 2 h at 50 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C, then stored for 118 days at 27 degrees C. Phenolic glucosides and their aglycons were extracted at regular intervals during the storage period and analyzed by HPLC. Results and discussion. All phenolic beta-glucosides were slowly hydrolyzed during the storage period with production of vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, and other unknown aglycons. Most of the beta-glucosidase was heat-denatured by the pretreatment, and analysis of its kinetic parameters showed that it adopts, in vivo, an allosteric mode of functioning with a lower affinity for glucovanillin than in vitro, where it behaves as a Michaelian enzyme. Conclusion. Extensive research is needed to confirm the allosteric mechanism of the vanilla beta-glucosidase in vivo...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide some {{recommendations}} for selecting a befitting tea and coffee to match chocolate with different cocoa contents. Three coffee samples (chocolate flavored, vanilla flavored and unflavored coffee), four tea samples (black tea, <b>green</b> tea, <b>vanilla</b> flavored tea and citrus flavored tea) and three chocolates (30 %, 70 %, and 99 % cocoa) were hedonically rated by eighty regular chocolate consumers. The beverages were then paired with each chocolate, and the consumers were asked to indicate the hedonic liking of the resulting pairings, and to indicate whether the chocolate or beverage flavor dominated the pairing flavor. This study showed that liking of chocolate and coffee pairings and chocolate and tea pairings significantly varied (p < 0. 001) across samples. Consumers preferred pairings with 30 % cocoa and 70 % cocoa chocolate to pairings with 99 % cocoa chocolate. Overall, coffee is significantly (p < 0. 001) preferred to tea as a chocolate partner. Chocolate and beverage pairing liking was biased by the liking of the beverage tasted alone, the liking of chocolate tasted alone, beverage type, chocolate type and the level of flavor match between chocolate and tea or coffee in a given pairing. When chocolate and beverage flavor balanced out in a given pairing, chocolate and coffee/tea pairings were significantly preferred by the consumers. A significant decrease in acceptance was observed when beverage or chocolate flavor dominated the flavor of the pairing, much more so when the chocolate flavor dominated the pairing flavor. However consumers don't enjoy any preferred chocolate with any preferred tea or coffee because some flavors match better than do others. Indeed, consumers formulate their hedonic responses taking into consideration what flavors go well together more than they rely exclusively on their hedonic judgments of the chocolates, the teas, and the coffees tasted alone...|$|R
40|$|Vanilla planifolia, a {{flowering}} epiphytic orchid, is {{the major}} natural source of vanilla flavour. Largely used in dairy products, beverages, bakeries and perfume, vanilla flavour is obtained after a long process: from eight to nine months after flower pollination, mature pods are harvested and then prepared during about one year in order to release the characteristic vanilla aroma. Nowadays, {{more than half of}} vanilla pods world production comes from Madagascar. To face the concurrence, a solution could be to develop higher quality pods. Selection of the most aromatic vanilla plant is then preferred. Nevertheless, amelioration program are facing up to a lack of knowledge in vanilla plant physiology.
