40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> {{such as the}} Internet and Computational Grids, {{have enabled}} a {{networked}} computing and communication environment. Although many organizations depend on network-centric information operations to support critical missions, existing <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> provide little guarantee of the dependability of network-centric computing and communication. This paper discusses some problems with the dependability of existing <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> such as stateless or centralized resource management. A Complex Adaptive Systems approach to dependability of futuristic <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is then presented with emphasis on the detection of emergent states at the regional and global levels of these infrastructures, and the self-synchronized control of such infrastructures in response to emergent states.

In {{this chapter}} {{we discuss the}} {{susceptibility}} of critical <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to computer-borne attacks and faults, mainly due to their largely computerized nature, and to the pervasive interconnection of systems all over the world. We discuss how {{to overcome these problems}} and achieve resilience of critical <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> through adequate architectural constructs. The architecture we propose is generic and may come to be useful as a reference for modern critical <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> We discuss four main aspects: trusted components which induce prevention; middleware devices that achieve runtime automatic tolerance and protection; trustworthiness monitoring mechanisms detecting and adapting to non-predicted situations; organization-level security policies and access control models capable of securing global information flows. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis {{is the concept of}} <b>{{information}}</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The term refers to a new class of information systems which have significant structural and functional differences compared with information systems that are theoretically modeled and practically developed in the context of typical organisational structures. <b>Information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> purpose lies beyond the boundaries of typical organizations. The term refers to installations that target maximally society and extend to a global scale. Structuration refers to a design and transfrmation procedure that is shaped by the interaction of existing structures with human action in a context defined by organisational and social together with technologiacal factors. The research area that the thesis addresses is this of information systems, in which it contributes through: a) the proposal of a framework for the study of transformation in organisational environment together with a categorisation of information systems b) the development of the notion of <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> with regard to their structure, functioning and evolution together with their relation to the organisational environment c) the presentation of applications which demonstrate the transformation taking place in information systems along with the increasing role of <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in their development, such as middleware services, distance learning systems and distributed information management systems. ...|$|R
