40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emissions {{targets are}} encouraging vehicle manufacturers to prioritise reduction of vehicle mass. The falling cost of carbon fibre is increasing {{the viability of}} lightweight carbon-based body panel systems across {{a broad range of}} production volumes. In the present work an automated process has been developed for the manufacture of random fibre preforms at medium volume production levels (30 - 50, 000 ppa). This thesis seeks to understand the influence of key microstructural parameters on the mechanical and physical properties of carbon fibre laminates produced by directed fibre preforming. The principal parameters studied are fibre length, tow <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> and laminate thickness. A statistical process simulation has been developed to predict preform density variation and the results are compared with experimental tensile properties. Experimental studies have shown that there is a notable reduction in areal density variation and consequently an increase in tensile properties with shorter fibres (115 mm to 6 mm) and thicker laminates (1. 5 mm to 4 mm for a constant volume fraction). Shorter lengths improved preform coverage and gave higher tensile strength, whilst thicker laminates reduced the presence of unreinforced areas which cause stress concentrations. Tow filamentisation has been induced by pneumatic means to reduce the mean <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> and maximise the mechanical performance when using inexpensive, 24 K bundles. By maximising the level of filamentisation both stiffness and strength can be increased by 20 % and 45 % respectively. An analytical stiffness model is presented to predict the effect of tow <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> on the in-plane elastic constants. <b>Filament</b> <b>count</b> and out-of-plane fibre orientation distributions are determined from optical microscopy and are incorporated into a multi-level Mori-Tanaka based model. Predictions are within 8 % of the experimental data for laminates containing large fibre bundles and 10 % for laminates with highly filamentised bundles. An expression for critical bundle length has been developed for more accurate strength prediction, {{based on the number of}} filaments within the bundle. Experimental results confirm that the critical tow length is proportional to the tow <b>filament</b> <b>count.</b> Directed fibre preforming has been benchmarked against other competing processes in respect of mechanical properties, weight saving potential and cost. A full-scale demonstrator component has been manufactured using a variety of carbon composite solutions, which can all provide 40 to 50 % weight saving for an equivalent bending stiffness to steel and greatly improved dent resistance. Directed fibre preforming has shown great promise for both semi-structural and structural components for medium volume applications, particularly when aligned fibres are introduced. The results from this work can be directly scaled for industrial application to provide a cost effective, lightweight alternative to steel.

40|$|Emerging {{concepts}} for on-chip biotechnologies aim {{to replace}} microfluidic flow by active, molecular-motor driven transport of cytoskeletal filaments, including applications in bio-simulation, biocomputation, diagnostics, and drug screening. Many of these applications require reliable detection, with minimal data acquisition, of filaments at many, local checkpoints in a device {{consisting of a}} potentially complex network of channels that guide filament motion. Here we develop such a detection system using actomyosin motility. Detection points consist of pairs of gold lines running perpendicular to nanochannels that guide motion of fluorescent actin filaments. Fluorescence interference contrast (FLIC) is used to locally enhance the signal at the gold lines. A cross-correlation method is used to suppress errors, allowing reliable detection of single or multiple filaments. Optimal device design parameters are discussed.

Thinner rovings are needed in sensor applications to raise the electrical resistance of the carbon fibre bundle used as strain sensor. Rovings with a lower <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> cannot be delivered by carbon fibre producers. A splitting technology is therefore needed. A continuous bundle splitting technique was developed. It uses mechanical means, liquid flow and variations in winding force and speed to separate the filaments. The impact of winding parameters and of the liquid flow on the splitting result was quantified in experiments with the developed splitting system. An automatic and continuous splitting of carbon fibre rovings was realised. Smaller bundles of carbon fibre filaments can be provided.

The volume fraction of SiC fiber and surface roughness of the composite layer affect mechanical and corrosion properties of the cladding tube. In this study, various types of SiC fiber preforms with tubular shapes were fabricated by a filament winding method using two types of Tyranno SA 3 grade SiC fibers with 800 filaments/yarn and 1600 filaments/yarn.

The model generates realistic random fibre architectures containing high <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> bundles (> 3 k) and high (~ 50 %) fibre volume fractions. Fibre bundles are modelled as thin shells using a multi-dimension modelling strategy, in which fibre bundles are distributed and compacted to simulate pressure being applied from a matched mould tool. FE simulations are performed to benchmark the in-plane mechanical properties obtained from the numerical model against experimental data, with a detailed study presented to evaluate the tensile properties at various fibre volume fractions and specimen thicknesses. Tensile modulus predictions are in close agreement (less than 5 % error) with experimental data at volume fractions below 45 %. Ultimate tensile strength predictions are within 4. 2 % of the experimental data at volume fractions between 40 %- 55 %.

We have incorporated it into a 2 D, stochastic computer model to study lamellipodia via the self-organization of filament orientation patterns. Essential dendritic-nucleation submodels were incorporated, including discretized actin monomer diffusion, Monte-Carlo filament kinetics, and flexible filament and plasma membrane mechanics. Model parameters were estimated from the literature and simulation, providing values for {{the extent of the}} leading edge-branching/capping-protective zone (5. 4 nm) and the autocatalytic branch rate (0. 43 /sec). For a given set of parameters, the system evolved to a steady-state <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> and velocity, at which total branching and capping rates were equal only for specific orientations; net capping eliminated others. The standard parameter set evoked a sharp preference for the ± 35 degree filaments seen in lamellipodial electron micrographs, requiring ≈ 12 generations of successive branching to adapt to a 15 degree change in protrusion direction. This pattern was robust with respect to membrane surface and bending energies and to actin concentrations but required protection from capping at the leading edge and branching angles > 60 degrees.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the actin cytoskeleton in prefusion aligning myoblasts {{is likely to be}} important for their shape and interaction. We investigated actin filament organization and polarity by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in these cells. About 84 % of the <b>filaments</b> <b>counted</b> were either found in a subplasmalemma sheet up to 0. 5 µm thick that was aligned with the long axis of the cell, or in protrusions. The remaining filaments were found in the cytoplasm, where they were randomly orientated and not organized into bundles. The polarity of the subplasmalemma filaments changed progressively {{from one end of the}} cell to the other. At the ends of the cells and in protrusions, the majority of filaments were organized such that their barbed ends faced the tip of the protrusion. We did not find any actin filament bundles or stress fibres in these cells. Time-lapse phase microscopy demonstrated that aligned cells were still actively migrating at the time of our TEM observations, and their direction of movement was restricted to the long axis of the cell group. The ability of these cells to locomote actively in the absence of actin filament bundles suggests that in these cells the subplasmalemma actin sheet contributes not only to cell shape but also to cell locomotion...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{composite}} material produced using a textile reinforcement depends largely {{on the way the}} textile deforms during processing. To ensure the production of high quality parts and minimise costs in designing such parts it is necessary to develop methods to predict the deformations of textiles. This thesis employs a multi scale modelling approach in predicting mechanical properties of textile fabrics. The three scales involved are the microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic. This thesis concentrates on the micro and mesoscopic scales leading to results applicable to the macroscopic scale. At the microscopic scale fibres are modelled as individual entities and the interactions between these entities are modelled. In compaction of yarns, the contact between fibres and bending resulting from these contacts governs the force response. A numerical model is developed to simulate this behaviour and results are validated against experimental studies found in the literature. The numerical model is extended to the mesoscopic scale where the shear of a plain woven fabric consisting of low <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> yarns is modelled. At the mesoscopic scale {{a large part of the}} work consists of characterising the geometry of textile fabrics. New and existing algorithms are combined together to form a consistent modelling approach. This work was performed in conjunction with the development of a software package named TexGen where these algorithms are implemented. The geometric models created by TexGen are then used to predict mechanical properties of textile unit cells using a finite element method which takes yarn properties as an input. Validation is performed for a series of woven fabrics subjected to compression and in-plane shear. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in using discontinuous carbon fibre composites for semi-structural applications within the automotive industry. The main advantages of discontinuous fibres are low material costs, low wastage and low touch labour compared with processes using carbon fibre textiles. Directed Carbon Fibre Preforming (DCFP) is an automated process for producing complex 3 D preforms for liquid moulding. DCFP offers the potential for producing highly optimised structures, with local control over tow size, fibre length and volume fraction within the component. The execution of this is challenging however, as confidence in the current library of material properties is low and existing structural optimisation packages only consider a very limited number of design variables, which are restricted to more conventional composite materials. This thesis aims to establish a structural design tool to exploit the design freedom offered by the DCFP process. A large number of parameters associated with the fibre architecture can be controlled to meet a range of design criterions such as performance, weight and cost. The optimisation tool is capable of generating locally varied fibre areal mass and thickness maps that are suitable for manufacture by the robot controlled process. The developed model adopts a multi-scaled finite element approach. Meso-scale simulations are performed to establish size effects in discontinuous fibre composites, to quantify the level of stochastic variability and to determine the representative volume element for a given fibre architecture. A DCFP material database is generated to facilitate macro-scale modelling at the component level. The macro-scale model iteratively redistributes material in order to minimise the total strain energy of the model under prescribed loading conditions. The optimised model is segmented into areas of uniform areal mass, where the zone geometries are tailored to achieve representative material properties according to the meso-scale results, whilst ensuring the design is fit for manufacture. An automotive spare wheel well has been chosen as a demonstrator component, enabling two DCFP architectures to be compared against a continuous glass/carbon fibre NCF design. The first case offers a high performance (high specific stiffness) solution and the second offers a low cost option using high <b>filament</b> <b>count</b> tows. Following optimisation, results suggest that a 3 K 25 mm fibre length DCFP option can achieve a specific stiffness 52...|$|E

Since rotifers {{play an important role in}} the carbon transfer between the microbial loop and higher trophic levels, these observations confirm the role of viruses in channeling carbon through food webs. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the DGGE profiles showed large changes in the structures of both the bacterial and eukaryotic communities at the time of lysis.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Biological Sciences) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Foaming of {{activated}} sludge during wastewater treatment can compromise {{the quality of}} treated wastewater (effluent) and create operational difficulties. The presence of high concentrations of mycolic acid-containing bacteria (mycolata) {{has been linked to}} foam production. Specifically, the nocardioform group of mycolata is often used as an indicator of bacterial foaming potential during secondary treatment in the {{activated sludge}} process, due to their role in foaming and their ease of enumeration. One major goal of nocardioform enumeration is to discover the threshold at which higher nocardioform concentrations will likely result in foaming. Such threshold values can potentially provide an important tool for wastewater treatment plant operators to predict and manage foaming. The purpose of my study was to help treatment plant staff control activated sludge foaming in the most efficient manner possible by comparing the accuracy and precision of four nocardioform counting methods to determine which method best predicts foaming. The second part of my {{study was to determine the}} nocardioform concentration threshold for foaming of activated sludge at Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP). Four types of nocardioform counts were performed: total and dispersed <b>filament</b> intersection <b>counts</b> and total and dispersed <b>filament</b> length <b>counts.</b> These counts were performed on Gram-stained slides under 1000 X magnification using an eyepiece reticule (grid) of a light microscope. The accuracy of each counting method in predicting foaming was assessed through correlation with mixed liquor foam measures. Two independent measures of foam severity were used during this study: (1) foam potential tests conducted in the laboratory and (2) observations of foam coverage over one secondary sedimentation tank. Laboratory foaming tests involved the bubbling of air through samples of activated sludge and measuring the resulting foam height and percent collapse of foam (in the absence of aeration). Precision of the nocardioform counting methods was compared by calculating the relative standard deviation (RSD) of four pseudoreplicate strip counts per method each day, followed by Friedman???s test of RSD mean ranks to test for statistically significant differences in the means. The nocardioform concentration threshold for foaming was calculated for total filament intersections/g volatile suspended solids (VSS). In order to confirm and explain the nocardioform count results, isolation and identification of nocardioforms from samples of activated sludge used for enumeration were attempted during both years of my study via culturing and 16 s rDNA sequencing. The majority of my study was conducted at SRWTP over the course of two nocardioform blooms (late summer and fall of 2009 and 2010). All four counting methods showed relatively weak correlations with the mixed liquor foaming measures used during my study, likely due to the contributions to foaming made by non-nocardioform mycolata and possibly surfactants during that time. The accidental isolation of Mycobacterium on two separate occasions during my study supports the notion of non-nocardioform mycolata contributing to activated sludge foaming at SRWTP. When foam stability was used as the criterion for defining the foaming threshold of mixed liquor, the corresponding nocardioform abundance fell into the range historically associated with foaming at SRWTP (1 x 106 total intersections/g VSS). The results of my study indicate that total nocardioform intersection counts most accurately predict activated sludge foaming, compared to the other three counting methods examined. Nocardioform length counts have better precision, but are less accurate at predicting foaming compared to total intersection counts. Biological Science...|$|R

In order to understand how fishes thrive in persistently low oxygen, 10 species of benthic fishes were sampled from Monterey Canyon, California U. S. A., which features a prominent OMZ. Fish adaptation to low oxygen was assessed through observations of oxygen demand (metabolic measurements, Vmax) and oxygen supply (gill surface area). Six species commonly found in the OMZ were compared to four others that were restricted to waters above or below the OMZ. Comparisons were tested within three orders to minimize phylogenetic effects. The six OMZ inhabiting species had different methods of coping with low oxygen. Proximate metabolism showed no distinct trend toward aerobic suppression or heightened reliance on anaerobic metabolism as might be expected in areas of low oxygen but there was a wide range of enzyme activities reflecting differences in activity amongst the fishes. Flatfishes had the lowest enzyme activities but demonstrated no differences in metabolism with habitat type, yet the OMZ-dwelling Microstomus pacificus has 1. 8 - 3 times larger gill surfaces than similarly sized flatfishes from higher oxygen waters. In scorpaeniform fishes, high aerobic metabolism was accompanied by large gill surface areas in two routine swimming OMZ-dwelling species (Anoplopoma fimbria, Careproctus melanurus), while low aerobic metabolism and small gills were observed in the sedentary Sebastolobus species. In gadiform fishes, no differences were measured in enzyme activity levels, but larger gill surfaces were observed in OMZ-dwelling Nezumia liolepis. Additionally, how each group attains larger gill surface area is highly divergent, with differences in primary <b>filaments</b> (lengths, <b>counts)</b> and secondary lamellae (bilateral area, density), suggesting no clear convergent trend across taxa and that compensation can occur many ways in gill architecture. In light of recent OMZ expansion, several species studied may have to shallow their vertical distributions. On the other hand, some species are OMZ specialists and will likely experience range expansion in the future...|$|R
