50|$|An {{encumbrance}} {{is a right}} to, interest in, {{or legal}} liability on real property that does not prohibit passing title to the property but that diminishes its value. Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (ex: liens) or non-financial (ex: easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (ex: lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the <b>encumbered</b> <b>property</b> (ex: restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (e.g. easements, wayleaves, real covenants, profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights. Also, those considered as potentially making the title defeasible are encumbrances, e.g. charging orders, building orders and structure alteration. Encumbrance: charge upon or claim against land arising out of private grant or a contract.|$|E

Part I explores the divergence between the former liability assumption rules and the 2 ̆ 2 economic benefit 2 ̆ 2 doctrine of the section 1001 regulations. Part II focuses on the technical definition of assumption of recourse and nonrecourse liabilities under amended section 357 (d). Part III examines the corollary basis provisions of section 362, as modified to reflect the section 357 (d) liability assumption rules. Part IV argues that by logical extension the amended liability assumption rules could also apply to corporate distributions of <b>encumbered</b> <b>property,</b> an area overlooked by Congress. The conclusion suggests that Congress should exercise caution in extending section 357 (d) principles and reconsider the approach of ad hoc anti-abuse measures...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} stress and economic difficulties which characterized {{sectors of the}} agriculture industry during the 1980 s may continue to trouble some producers into the 1990 s {{as a result of}} drought and international competition. This report explains legal alternatives available to creditors for using a borrower's personal property to satisfy debt secured with personal property as well as unsecured debt. A debt is secured when a creditor has a lien; that is, the legal right to seize and use some of the borrower's property to pay an obligation. An unsecured debt is not accompanied with a legal right entitling the creditor to seize some of the borrower's property if the obligation is not paid. Instead, a creditor must convince a court that an amount is owed, but unpaid. The creditor will then proceed to collect payment as prescribed by statute and the court. The two most common means for a creditor to acquire a lien are 1) for the borrower to voluntarily grant a lien (a voluntary lien), and 2 } for the creditor to acquire a lien according to statutory law and without the borrower's consent. This second category of liens {{is often referred to as}} statutory, involuntarily, or nonconsensual liens. The most common statutory liens that apply to agriculture in North Dakota are the agricultural supplier's lien, agricultural processor's lien, and agister's lien (which encumbers livestock being kept or fed for their owner). The typical voluntary lien to encumber personal property is a security interest which empowers creditors to repossess the <b>encumbered</b> <b>property</b> as long as there is no breach of the peace. The alternative for creditors is to rely on the judicial proceeding of claim and delivery to seize the property. The law specifies limitations as well as protection for debtors. For example, a debtor is not relieved of an obligation even though the debtor's assets are not sufficient to pay the obligation. Likewise, a debtor cannot give away property to frustrate a creditor's collection attempts. However, a debtor is allowed to retain exempt assets; that is, those items state statutory law specifies as beyond the reach of creditors. Exempt personal property includes the family's clothing; one year's supply of provisions for the family (including fuel); a trailer, mobile home, or $ 7, 500 (substitute for a homestead); property valued between $ 5, 000 and $ 8, 000 ($ 2, 500 for a single person); a vehicle up to $ 1, 200 in value; and certain pensions, annuities, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and limited payments from specified pension programs (such as social security). Financial disputes are not limited to debtors and creditors. Creditors also compete with each other to collect their obligation from the borrower's assets. Such conflicts are resolved according to the priority of the creditors. Few financial disputes will be litigated; instead, most culminate with the parties negotiating a settlement that is preferrable to litigation. The parties must fully understand their legal rights and the likely result of litigating (including the cost and time necessary to litigate), however, in order to recognize an acceptable settlement.

[...] In 1850, however, the California State Legislature enacted property laws that expressly undermined certain aspects of the constitutional guarantee.

40|$|The 1991 North Dakota Legislature {{extensively}} considered economic development. Growing North Dakota, {{perhaps one}} of the most comprehensive proposals, was not adopted until near the end of the session. This program encourages diversification and industrialization of North Dakota agriculture, as well as provides continued funding for several agricultural programs, including the beginning farmer program. The legislators acted to protect groundwater resources and established a Northwestern Area Water Authority. Water permit application fees were increased by 100 % for both irrigation and livestock uses. The recent drought and need for water for livestock culminated in a livestock water assistance program. A grasshopper pest control bill allows township governments to spray ditches after notifying the landowner. Other legislation mandates that landowners pay 20 % of the cost for noxious weed control on their land. The legislature also enacted a pilot disposal program for pesticide containers. Several bills eased the procedure for creditors to <b>encumber</b> <b>property.</b> Agricultural suppliers and machinery repairmen will have more time in which to file a lien against the property. Borrowers no longer need to sign a waiver of the homestead exemption. A computerized central filing system was established for agricultural commodity liens so farm product buyers and subsequent creditors can be better informed of encumbrances. A debtor whose real estate mortgage is being foreclosed will have 10 (rather than 15) business days before the sale to designate a homestead exemption. Oilseed and edible bean growers who sell their commodities out of state will have to pay into the promotion fund. The definition of handler and processor for both products was expanded to include out-of-state elevators and warehouses.

40|$|Conservation {{easements}} are a tool landowners can use {{to protect}} their land and preserve it for generations to come. Given the new emphasis society places on preserving the environment, many states have enacted some form of a conservation easement program where landowners who <b>encumber</b> their <b>property</b> with a conservation easement can receive a benefit for doing so. Wisconsin and Virginia are two states {{with this type of}} program. Wisconsin’s conservation easement program allows a landowner to donate his land and the state pays him the difference in the market value. Virginia’s program, on the other hand, allows a landowner to donate a conservation easement with the option of receiving a transferable tax credit in exchange for the donation.

Randolph, who had always had a temper, became increasingly angry toward his wife's father, his sons, and Martha herself, feeling that they did not do enough to save Edgehill but focused on saving Thomas Jefferson's estate, Monticello, instead. Monticello was also in danger of being sold due to debts and the poor economy, but most members of the family believed that it would provide a better chance for them than would the more heavily <b>encumbered</b> Edgehill <b>property.</b> At times Randolph became irrational, and his angry outbursts caused all his adult children to distance themselves from him.
