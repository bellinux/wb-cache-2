40|$|Introduction The World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) (FAO 1998) is the internationallyaccepted soil {{classification}} system, {{endorsed by the}} International Union of Soil Science (IUSS), and hence by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It is intended for correlation of soil individuals {{as defined by the}} pedon concept, and is ideally suited to discussing world soils, their major properties and genesis (Driessen et aL 2001). It is not intended for the large-scale mapping necessary in urban areas. The WRB is a twolevel classification: 30 reference groups which <b>have</b> <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in terms of pedogenesis, geography, and use potential. Groups may be defined based mainly on substrate (e. g. Arenosols, Andosols, Leptosols) or on pedogenesis (e. g. Mollisols). They are further divided by a long list of qualifters: strong expression, intergrades, and weak expression. As many qualifters as apply to a soil may be used.

40|$|Concurrent {{constraint}} {{programming is}} classically based on asynchronous communication via a shared store. Synchrony {{can be achieved}} by forcing concurrently running ask and tell primitives to synchronise on "new common information". This paper outlines this framework, called Scc, and develops an algebraic semantics for it. The Scc framework is shown to share similarities with both the traditional concurrent constraint setting and algebraic languages like CCS but also to <b>have</b> <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> which requires the use of new techniques in formulating the algebraic semantics. Among these are the introduction of an auxiliary communication operator to handle the treatment of synchrony and the extension of the concept of cylindric algebras by allowing the hiding of the empty set of variables in order to permit local computations. More importantly, new axioms have been introduced to describe our variants of the tell and ask primitives. The algebraic semantics is proved to be sound and complete [...] ...|$|E

The LORA process, outlined in the new Military Standard (MIL-STD) 1390 D, is required to be accomplished in each DoD weapon system acquisition program. The Standard outlines 13 different service peculiar models. The Joint V- 22 Program must determine an effective LORA methodology that appropriately considers Service unique requirements while limiting the need to run both the NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIRSYSCOM) Model III and the Air Force RLA methods of LORA.

40|$|Background: {{familial}} {{factors are}} clearly {{associated with an}} increased risk of developing late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, there is emerging evidence to suggest that familial factors may also influence clinical phenotype. To date, most studies have focussed on familial influences upon age of onset or duration of illness and few studies have compared the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms between familial and sporadic LOAD. Objective: to describe the clinical phenotype, with an emphasis on non-cognitive symptoms, of patients with LOAD and to explore familial differences. Method: 374 patients with LOAD were recruited from the community based Camberwell Dementia Case Register and a comparison made of the clinical phenotype of patients with and without a first degree family history of dementia. Results: a first degree family history of dementia was found in 27 % of fully ascertained cases. An earlier age of onset was found in familial cases (77. 2 years compared to 78. 3 years, p < 0. 05). However, no other differences in clinical phenotype, including the rate of cognitive decline, duration or the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms, were found between familial and sporadic cases. Conclusions: apart from an earlier age of onset, patients with familial LOAD, as a group, do not <b>have</b> <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in their clinical phenotype compared to patients with sporadic LOAD...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTAlthough human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and 2 (HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2) {{share similar}} genetic organization, they <b>have</b> <b>major</b> <b>differences</b> in their {{pathogenesis}} and disease manifestation. HTLV- 1 {{is capable of}} transforming T lymphocytes in infected patients and subsequently leads to adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) whereas HTLV- 2 is not clearly associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. Numerous studies have provided accumulating evidence on {{the involvement of the}} viral transactivators Tax- 1 versus Tax- 2 in T cell transformation. Tax- 1 is a potent transcriptional activator of both viral and cellular genes. Tax- 1 posttranslational modifications and specifically ubiquitylation and SUMOylation have been implicated in NF-кB activation and may contribute to its transformation capacity. Although Tax- 2 has similar protein structure compared to Tax- 1, the two proteins display differences both in their protein-protein interaction and activation of signal transduction pathways. Recent studies on Tax- 2 have suggested ubiquitylation and SUMOylation independent mechanisms of NF-кB activation. In this present review, structural and functional differences between Tax- 1 and Tax- 2 will be summarized. Specifically, we will address their subcellular localization, nuclear trafficking and their effect on cellular regulatory proteins. A special attention will be given to Tax- 1 /Tax- 2 post-translational modification such as ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, NF-кB activation and protein-protein interactions involved in oncogenecity both in vivo and in vitro...|$|E
