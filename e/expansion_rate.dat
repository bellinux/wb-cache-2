5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the <b>expansion</b> <b>rate.</b> Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for conservation programmes to make quantitative predictions of biodiversity responses to changed environments. Such predictions will be particularly important to promote species recovery in fragmented landscapes, and to understand and facilitate distribution responses to climate change. Here, we model <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> of a test species (a rare butterfly, Hesperia comma) in five landscapes over 18 years (generations), using a metapopulation model (the incidence function model). <b>Expansion</b> <b>rates</b> increased with the area, quality and proximity of habitat patches available for colonization, with predicted <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> closely matching observed rates in test landscapes. Habitat fragmentation constrained expansion, but in a predictable way, suggesting that it will prove feasible both to understand variation in <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> and to develop conservation programmes to increase <b>rates</b> of range <b>expansion</b> in such species...|$|R

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E

40|$|Ongoing and {{predicted}} global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic {{perspective on the}} so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range <b>expansion</b> <b>rates.</b> We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range <b>expansion</b> <b>rates,</b> consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance <b>expansion</b> <b>rates.</b> Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce <b>expansion</b> <b>rates.</b> Overall, {{it is clear that}} interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species...|$|R
40|$|The American {{chestnut}} tree (Castanea dentata) {{has been plagued}} by the fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica. While the primary biological control treatment has relied upon the use of hypovirus, a mycovirus that reduces the virulence of C. parasitica, here the potential for a Streptomyces inoculum as a biological control is explored. Two Wisconsin stands of infected chestnut in Galesville and Rockland were inoculated with hypovirus and Streptomyces using a randomized block design. At these stands the Streptomyces treatment reduced canker length <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> more than the hypovirus treatments and control. The Streptomyces treatment had significantly lower canker width <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> compared to the control. In addition to having reduced canker <b>expansion</b> <b>rates,</b> the trees inoculated with Streptomyces had the lowest mortality rate. The diversity of the fungus was low at the study sites and consisted of only two known vegetative compatibility types at each stand. This low level of diversity made it ideal for hypovirus dispersal, and for limiting canker <b>expansion</b> <b>rates.</b> This research supports the hypothesis that Streptomyces treatment is an effective alternative to hypovirus treatment that may prove beneficial in areas where hypovirus efforts have failed...|$|R

25|$|Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: {{its high}} {{moisture}} content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels {{with a high}} moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally {{in the range of}} 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.|$|E

40|$|Marginal likelihoods for {{the cosmic}} <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> are {{evaluated}} using the `Constitution' data of 397 supernovas, thereby updating {{the results in}} some previous works. Even when beginning with a very strong prior probability that favors an accelerated expansion, we obtain a marginal likelihood for the deceleration parameter q_ 0 peaked around zero in the spatially flat case. It is {{also found that the}} new data significantly constrains the cosmographic <b>expansion</b> <b>rates,</b> when compared to the previous analyses. These results may strongly depend on the Gaussian prior probability distribution chosen for the Hubble parameter represented by h, with h= 0. 68 ± 0. 06. This and similar priors for other <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> were deduced from previous data.

25|$|The {{size of the}} throat, mouth, {{the length}} of the horn, as well as the area <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> along it must be {{carefully}} chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner {{as an extension of the}} horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.|$|E

Olds' next assignment was to the Plans Division of the Office of Chief of the Air Corps on January 5, 1940, working for Spaatz, who had been promoted to brigadier general. Olds advanced to colonel on October 16, 1940. While working in the Plans Division, he received a suggestion from Nancy Love, a woman aviator (and wife of an Air Corps Reserve friend, 1st Lt. Robert Love), that he give serious consideration of the use of women pilots to ferry new aircraft from the factory in case of war. Olds replied by asking her to provide him with a list of women pilots with commercial pilot ratings.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1940 s, the {{distributions}} of several butterfly {{species have been}} expanding in northern Europe, probably in response to climate warming.

Observed and simulated <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> were in very close agreement but were 42 %– 45 % slower in an area that had 24 % less woodland. Unlike P. aegeria, the majority of butterfly species are not currently expanding, almost certainly because of lack of suitable habitat.

A combination of two techniques, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Pulsed Shadowgraphy (PS), was used to collect images for further treatment in order to characterize the liquid flow pattern {{in front of the}} bubble and the bubble shape. Processing the images acquired with pulsed illumination from behind the bubble it was possible to define with precision the bubble shape at different stages when it was expanding. The operation conditions used allowed a wide range of volume <b>expansion</b> <b>rates</b> (0 to 28. 5 × 10 - 6 m 3 /s) with a significant effect on the Taylor bubble velocity; increases in bubble velocity up to 21 % were observed relatively to constant volume system condition.

The flange at the mouth solved some remaining problems with lobing at higher frequencies. Don Keele specified in one version of his design a wider horizontal flare for pattern control appropriate to public address purposes.

2500|$|Some {{parts of}} the Universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big Bang to have {{had enough time to}} reach Earth, so these {{portions}} of the Universe lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to Hubble's law, regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light (special relativity prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see uses of the proper distance for a discussion) and furthermore the <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> appears to be accelerating due to dark energy. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging cosmological constant), so that the <b>expansion</b> <b>rate</b> of the Universe continues to accelerate, there is a [...] "future visibility limit" [...] beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe {{at any time in the}} infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually). This future visibility limit is calculated at a comoving distance of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light years), assuming the Universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36. = 2.36.|$|E
