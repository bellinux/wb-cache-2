40|$|Abstract: Salto de San Fernando” {{hydropower}} plant is placed at River Tormes, just upstream of Santa Teresa reservoir (Salamanca, Spain). The dam is 13 m high {{and it has}} a pool and weir with bottom orifice fish ladder to let potamodromous fish (Iberian barbel – Luciobarbus bocagei–, Nothern straightmouth nase –Pseudochondrostoma duriense– and brown trout –Salmo trutta–) overcome the obstacle. This fish ladder is being monitored since 2012 : daily trapping and counting fish that reach the last pool; fish passage video recording through orifices and spillways; tagging <b>fish</b> (<b>PIT,</b> Tbar and others) and studying passage metrics (location, entrance, passage time, performance). Results have been analyzed as a function of physical –discharge, temperature, atmospheric pressure– and biological variables –species, sex, size, competition–. Downstream migration is also analyzed to locate fish routes and understand fish behavior. After every research, passage improvement options are detected, accomplished and assessed on next migration season. At this moment, this overall approach has quintupled fish ladder efficiency and it offers lot of information about Iberian fish behavior and their preference under different hydraulic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of intramuscular tagging with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) on the basic condition and hematological and biochemical indexes of the blood plasma of juvenile European perch (initial body weight of approximately 80 g). Throughout the observation period, i. e., for 42 days following PIT implantation, the procedure was not noted to have had a negative impact on fish growth, condition, or feed conversion ratio. The blood plasma biochemical indicators analyzed did not differ statistically significantly between the <b>fish</b> tagged with <b>PIT</b> and the untagged control group. No significant impact from this procedure was noted in the hematological indexes tested. Only with regard to the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) parameter was the value significantly lower in the <b>fish</b> tagged with <b>PIT</b> than in the control group (P ≤ 0. 05). The difference determined was 1. 40 pg (28. 78 vs. 30. 18). The MCH level in the <b>fish</b> tagged with <b>PIT</b> most probably was within the norm for this species.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to monitor movement and spawning activity of burbot Lota lota in the Kootenai River, Idaho and British Columbia, Canada during the winter of 2003 - 2004. Due to low precipitation and snow pack, as well as low levels of Lake Koocanusa, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers refrained from releasing discharges > 113 m{sup 3 }/s from Libby Dam for most of the winter. This situation provided suitable conditions for burbot migration and spawning in the mainstem river. Hoop nets captured 19 burbot, which ranged from 447 mm to 760 mm TL (mean = 630 mm) and weighed from 420 g to 4, 032 g (mean = 1, 937 g) with a mean W{sub r} of 99. One burbot (burbot 214) was captured for the fifth time since its first capture in 2000, and each capture was near Ambush Rock (rkm 244. 4 - 244. 8). Eleven burbot were tagged with five-month duration external sonic transmitters, and a 12 th burbot, tagged with a 14 -month transmitter, has been monitored since 2001. During the post-spawn period, three sonic-tagged burbot exhibited downstream and sedentary movement patterns, while five remained at Ambush Rock. Concentrations of tagged burbot near Ambush Rock (rkm 244. 5) during January and February 2004 (eight tagged fish) may suggest that this area is critical spawning habitat. The appearance of burbot at Ambush Rock during the spawning period and upstream movements of tagged <b>fish</b> (<b>PIT</b> and sonic tagged) in previous years during the low discharges help validate results suggesting that discharges < 113 m{sup 3 }/s will permit burbot migration and may increase spawning habitat.

40|$|In 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service {{completed}} the sixteenth {{year of a}} study to estimate survival and travel time of juvenile salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. passing through dams and reservoirs on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. All estimates were derived from detections of fish tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. We PIT tagged and released a total of 18, 565 hatchery steelhead O. mykiss, 15, 991 wild steelhead, and 9, 714 wild yearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha at Lower Granite Dam in the Snake River. In addition, we utilized <b>fish</b> <b>PIT</b> tagged by other agencies at traps and hatcheries upstream from the hydropower system and at sites within the hydropower system in both the Snake and Columbia Rivers. These included 122, 061 yearling Chinook salmon tagged at Lower Granite Dam for evaluation of latent mortality related to passage through Snake River dams. PIT-tagged smolts were detected at interrogation facilities at Lower Granite, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Ice Harbor, McNary, John Day, and Bonneville Dams and in the PIT-tag detector trawl operated in the Columbia River estuary. Survival estimates were calculated using a statistical model for tag-recapture data from single release groups (the single-release model). Primary research objectives in 2008 were to: (1) estimate reach survival and travel time in the Snake and Columbia Rivers throughout the migration period of yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead, (2) evaluate relationships between survival estimates and migration conditions, and (3) evaluate the survival estimation models under prevailing conditions. This report provides reach survival and travel time estimates for 2008 for PIT-tagged yearling Chinook salmon (hatchery and wild), hatchery sockeye salmon O. nerka, hatchery coho salmon O. kisutch, and steelhead (hatchery and wild) in the Snake and Columbia Rivers.

We measured movement in a small headwater stream using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and stationary antennas to record time and date of movement. <b>Fish</b> with <b>PIT</b> tags were detected by transceivers and stationary antennas in the stream. The date and time of detection at an antenna were matched with stream discharge (m 3 /s) at the same date and time. Most Dolly Varden moved upstream during late summer and early fall. Most cutthroat trout movement was in May, and movement declined through the summer. Few fish moved during the winter. Most fish moved within a narrow discharge range, with a few moving at higher discharges. More than 97 % of fish from both species were detected as moving upstream at discharges below the 5 % exceedance level during the 4 -year period of discharge measurements.

40|$|The native Colorado River Basin ichthyofauna {{represents}} one of the most imperiled fish assemblages in the world. Habitat alteration, water development, fragmentation, and interactions with non-native species have led to severe declines in both distribution and abundance of many endemic fishes. The bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus), flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) and roundtail chub (Gila robusta) are species native to the Colorado River Basin which have experienced severe declines in abundance and distribution and thus, placement on the Utah Sensitive Species List. However, all three species are found in the San Rafael River in southern Utah, providing an area of high conservation priority. Our goal is to estimate vital rates, migration patterns, and habitat requirements for each species and life stage, the critical components for completing robust population viability analyses and to evaluate management options. In 2007, we sampled fish from 22 systematically selected (random seed) 300 -m stream reaches. All fish were weighed, measured, and released. Target species were PIT tagged. Habitat parameters were recorded in each sampled reach. Although non-native fish comprised the majority of our catch, 20 native <b>fish</b> were <b>PIT</b> tagged, including flannelmouth sucker and roundtail chub of multiple age classes, along with a pair of adult bluehead sucker. Age- 0 flannelmouth sucker distribution showed a strong correlation with backwater habitat.

The second study identified the most suitable media for refrigeration during live storage and transport to address concerns with skin and meat integrity prior to processing. The third study focused on principles of aquaculture by examining growth, and lipid class and fatty acid profiles of muscle and gonad tissues of sea cucumbers fed with either diatoms or <b>fish</b> eggs.

Finally, while sea cucumbers were able to feed on live diatoms (Chaetoceros muelleri) as well as commercial fish eggs, the latter diet yielded greater body length increment, specific growth rate and ratio of essential DHA:EPA in gonadal tissues. In contrast, sea cucumbers fed with diatoms exhibited the highest ratio of the essential fatty acids ARA to EPA in muscle tissues.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2014 The Shasta River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} tributaries of the Klamath River for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). There are two primary spawning and juvenile rearing areas for Chinook salmon in the Shasta: the lower basin canyon, and the Shasta-Big Springs complex of the upper basin. These two areas of the basin are characterized by dramatically different in-stream habitats. This project evaluated differences in growth, residence time, and size at outmigration between these two critical salmonid habitat areas in the Shasta River using a combination of mark-recapture field studies and otolith strontium isotope ratio analysis of new and archived samples. In spring 2012 and 2013, during the primary rearing time for juvenile Chinook salmon in the Shasta River, three groups of <b>fish</b> were <b>PIT</b> tagged: (1) <b>fish</b> caught, tagged, and released in the upper basin; (2) fish caught at the lower basin, tagged and transplanted to the upper basin; and (3) fish caught, tagged, and released in the lower basin. Results indicate significant differences in residence time (defined as tagging date to date of outmigration), growth, and outmigration size between fish in the upper and lower basin, regardless of whether fish were originally caught in the upper basin or transplanted there. Several tagged fish residing in the Shasta-Big Springs complex displayed upstream movement and long residency times more similar to river-type Chinook salmon, than to ocean-type juveniles. Strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in stream water collected in March 2012 and 2013 were measured to be 0. 704 (precision of 0. 000031) and 0. 706 (precision of 0. 000019) for the upper basin and the lower basin respectively. Juvenile Chinook salmon that reared in the lower or upper basin are identifiable by the distinct differences in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr incorporated into the juvenile region of the otoliths. This creates a unique opportunity to determine the relative contribution of the two rearing areas to juvenile Chinook salmon production and, potentially, adult returns via analysis of juvenile and adult otoliths. Overall, I found consistent difference in the duration of residence, growth, and outmigration size between juvenile Chinook salmon that reared in the upper or lower Shasta River basin, irrespective of the location from which fish were initially sampled. Life history differences reflected differences in habitat conditions between the upper and lower basin. Additionally, this project demonstrated the potential use of otolith isotope analysis to identify the rearing location of juvenile Chinook salmon, which may affect marine survival and adult returns...|$|R

Although upstream migration in near-natural bypasses was often documented {{little is known about}} their use for downstream migrating fish. We studied two near-natural bypass channels: a 90 m long bypass at a small hydropower plant (Birs River) and a 1200 m long at a big hydropower plant (Aare River). To detect <b>fish</b> migration, we <b>PIT</b> tagged <b>fish.</b> Antennas were installed at the lower and upper end of the bypasses. 451 individuals were tagged in a bypass channel of the Aare River and 561 individuals in the Birs River. Movements were recorded between 125 - 140 days. Groups of translocated fishes were released upstream of the power plants in order to document downstream migrations through the bypass. The bypass in the Aare River was rich in fish species (22 species). Mainly barbels and chubs were studied. Chubs mainly migrated downstream (day and night), whereas barbels preferred to migrate at night in both directions. The migrating barbels were significantly bigger than resident barbels. 14 % of the translocated fish returned into the bypass (half of them through the upper antenna). In the bypass of the Birs River we could show that the direction of migration depends on the fish length. Small brown trout were resident or migrated downstream, whereas bigger trout migrated upstream. Out of the 215 translocated brown trout only 3 % entered the bypass from the upstream direction. Our studies documented the importance of the bypass systems as compensatory habitat, and as migration corridor for upstream migrating fish. But near-natural bypass channels only had a marginal importance as a corridor for downstream migrating fish...|$|R

Mean juvenile Coho Salmon density in summer and fall increased eightfold from 0. 04 to 0. 32 and from 0. 08 to 0. 68 fish/m 2, respectively, approaching levels seen in established populations, but did not explain variation in trout growth, movement, or survival. Summer growth of trout parr and fry were both negatively correlated with the density of conspecifics but were positively correlated with total salmonid density. Additionally, trout parr growth was positively correlated with stream discharge, whereas trout fry growth was negatively correlated with initial size and declined {{during the course of the}} study. However, abiotic and biotic explanatory variables accounted for little of the variation in trout growth, movement, and survival, suggesting that a great deal of individual variation exists. Overall, trout were largely unaffected by Coho Salmon colonists despite large increases in juvenile Coho Salmon density, though this may change if salmon populations continue to grow...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Pacific halibut has {{supported}} a major commercial fishery on the West {{coast of the}} United States for over 100 years. In the past, the halibut fishery was managed by a policy of open access which led to an overcapitalized fishery and raised concerns about overfishing, fishing safety, and deteriorating product quality. In order to address these problems, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council implemented an individual transferable quota program for the halibut fishery in the Spring of 1995. The new quota regulations will provide some benefit to the severely overcapitalized halibut fishery. However, the ITQ program may threaten resource sustainability by providing fishermen with an incentive to exceed their quota and high grade their catch. In addition, the quota consolidation, job loss, and costs that will result from the new system will raise several ethical concerns regarding the ideas of social equity, efficiency, and stewardship. Based on traditional conservation ethics {{as well as more}} modern ideas, the envirocentric ethical approach to quota management can be used to address some of these environmental and ethical problems. Fishing quotas have had an interesting political history which has been evolving for the past 20 years. The quota issue spurred intense debate in Congress during the reauthorization of the Magnuson Act in 1996 and divided the <b>fishing</b> industry while <b>pitting</b> environmental groups against each other. With the Magnuson Act being amended, environmental groups were able to lobby Congress to include in the rewrite a 4 -year moratorium on new quota programs. The NPFMC did a commendable job with an overwhelming task by creating an ITQ plan which {{could be used as a}} prototype for future quota management. Although the halibut system adequately addresses several difficult issues, it will also produce its own problems, the full extent of which may not be realized for years to come. This research suggests that not only do ITQs provide some benefits, but also that much caution should be exhibited when allocating fishery resources in this manner...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{patterns}} can {{be flexible}} for generalists, which {{benefit from a}} wide range of food resources [...] Optimal diet theory suggests a selected foraging strategy should maximise energetic income. Therefore, a prey type with less energetic value than its energetic return of the capture success is bound to be dropped. Learning improves prey cognition and handling efficiency of the individual and can alter the ratio of gains to costs related with foraging on previously consumed prey. If the uptake of food resources in a specific habitat is linked to a certain habitat-specific predation risk, a trade-off exists between foraging and predator avoidance that may severely affect behaviour and activity levels. Juvenile fish need habitats with high structural complexity as feeding grounds as well as a refuge against predators. Non-natural water bodies often differ immensely from natural lakes and most important repeatedly lack structural diversity in the littoral area. At steep banks lacking structural diversity, planted floatable textile mats may be thus an alternative to establish littoral elements to minimise structural deficiencies. The objective of this study was to analyse the functionality of such plant islands for the invertebrate fauna and the juvenile fish community. This study showed that artificial plant islands can enhance structural heterogeneity and food supply, therefore being beneficial for recruitment of juvenile <b>fish</b> in gravel <b>pit</b> lakes, when densely vegetated and connectivity between shoreline and the islands� root cavities is provided. As foraging behaviour and predator avoidance are dependent on size, two size classes of YOY perch were analysed in tank experiments, using a passive integrated transponder system. The fish were able to increase their potential food intake by entering a compartment in which small cyprinids were provided as prey fishes, but where also a predator (pike) was present. When prey fish were present, the large YOY perch significantly increased the activity level in the test tank while the small size class perch did not. Activity periods of small perch shifted to daylight under the threat of predation while large perch were more active during the twilight periods. These results provide evidence that small and large size YOY perch adjusted the trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance in dependence to size. To gain better understanding on the effect experience has on the behavioural consequences of food selection YOY perch were trained on different food resources. These trained perch and untrained specimen from the field were offered a fixed concentration of zooplankton with different levels of fish or a novel food resource, Limnomysis benedenii. The latter was selected only at high energetic values. Although fish was the preferred prey for all groups of YOY perch, only trained perch (piscivorous and planktivorous) positively selected fish at all energetic values offered. Not only experience in food resources, but also previously experienced predation pressure influenced perch behaviour. YOY perch exhibit a complex mode of behaviour with regards to feeding behaviour allowing them to change strategies when necessary. To conduct studies concerning the ecology of fish population it is essential to get fish samples which truly reflect the population structure. Capture success of different fishing techniques depends mainly on the activity of individuals, their abundance and the habitat where each method is applied. In shallow experimental ponds and gravel pit lakes the capture success of multi-mesh gillnetting and electrofishing was examined. Additionally, in the deep gravel <b>pit</b> lakes bongo-net <b>fishing</b> was used in spring to monitor perch larvae in the pelagic zone after hatching. The three methods were compared and recommendations how to improve fish stock assessment were given. It is then important to preserve and store caught fish as it is often not possible to analyse individuals in the field. In this study, juvenile perch were measured and frozen at - 20 °C, preserved in 70 % ethanol or 4 % formalin and remeasured after 24 h, 3 days, 7 days and then on a weekly basis for eight weeks. Ethanol strongly decreased length and weight of preserved perch. Formalin preservation also led to comparable length reduction but increased the weight of preserved perch. In contrast, frozen perch showed less shrinkage and only moderate weight loss. In the morphometric analysis also freezing clearly revealed the lowest shape differences compared to fresh fish. Hence, freezing is recommended as the most preferable preservation method, especially in multi-disciplinary studies on fish ecology...|$|R
