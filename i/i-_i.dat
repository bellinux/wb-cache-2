After a review of the realization methods in the underwater acoustic context, it is shown that the Optimal Realization Method is very well suited to the wideband analysis, thanks to the rational modelling.

It is important to note that this method uses no a priori assumption about source locations or source models.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{were used}} to discern critical amino acid residues for {{the function of the}} <b>I-</b> Ceu <b>I</b> homing endonuclease: sequence comparison of subfamilies of homologous proteins and genetic selection. The first approach revealed residues potentially involved in catalysis and DNA recognition. Because <b>I-</b> Ceu <b>I</b> is lethal in Escherichia coli, enzyme variants not perturbing cell viability were readily selected from an expression library. A collection of 49 variants with single amino acid substitutions at 37 positions was assembled. Most of these positions are clustered within or around the LAGLI-DADG dodecapeptide and the TQH sequence, two motifs found in all protein subfamilies examined. The Km and kcat values of the wild-type and nine variant enzymes synthesized in vitro were determined. Three variants, including one showing a substitution of the glutamine residue in the TQH motif, revealed no detectable endonuclease activity; five others showed reduced activity compared to the wild-type enzyme; whereas the remaining variant cleaved the top strand about three times more efficiently than the wild-type.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} gene replacement method, {{based on the}} recombination and repair activities of the cell, was developed. The method permits the targeted construction of markerless deletions, insertions and point mutations in the Escherichia coli chromosome. A suicide plasmid, carrying the mutant allele and the recognition site of meganuclease <b>I-</b> Sce <b>I,</b> is inserted into the genome by homologous recombination between the mutant and the wild-type (wt) alleles. Resolution of this cointegrate by intramolecular recombination of the allele pair results in either a mutant or a wt chromosome which can be distinguished by allele-specific PCR screening. The resolution process is stimulated by introducing a unique double-strand break (DSB) into the chromosome at the <b>I-</b> Sce <b>I</b> site. Cleavage by the nuclease not only enhances the frequency of resolution by two to three orders of magnitude, but also selects for the resolved products.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A factor {{analysis}} of 51 grab samples from the east-central Bering Sea con-tinental shelf identified three factors that account for 88 % {{of the variation in}} the relative amounts of the nine major heavy mineral groups that were used as variables.

The occurrences and textural associations of Factor <b>I-</b> <b>I</b> I I sediments indicate that the relative fractions of the characteristic minerals have been largely determined by sorting; proximity of source is more important along the Alaskan mainland.

40|$|Just {{a couple}} of {{transition}} metal complexes of the familiar triiodide anion are known. To investigate the bonding in these, as well as isomeric possibilities, we examined theoretically adducts of I 3 - with model organometallic fragments, [Cr(CO) 5] and [Mn(CO) 5]+. Bonding energy computations were augmented by a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) perturbation theory analysis and Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA). The bonding between I 3 - and the organometallic fragment is substantial, especially for the electrostatically driven anion-cation case. "End-on" coordination is favored by 5 - 13 kcal/mol over "side-on" (to the central I of I 3 -), with a ∼ 10 kcal/mol barrier for isomerization. A developing asymmetry in the I-I bonding of "end-on" coordinated I 3 - led us to consider in some detail the obvious fragmentation to a coordinated <b>I-</b> and free <b>I</b> 2.

Bare NiO films were tested also as photocathodes of nonsensitized p-DSCs. The ex situ XPS analysis of I 4 d ionization region of both reference and electrochemically treated NiO films showed that the presence of native and electrochemically generated Ni 3 + and Ni 4 + centers induces fast adsorption/desorption of I- ions and catalyzes their oxidation to I 3 - ions.
