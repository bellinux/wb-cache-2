While synthetic ion channel research attempts to prepare compounds that show conductance via a <b>defined</b> <b>path,</b> the elucidation of mechanism is difficult and seldom unambiguous. The two main methods of characterization both have their drawbacks, and as a consequence, often function is defined but mechanism presumed.|$|E

Each bud is an aggregate {{of a few}} dozen cells, {{and the way it}} gets to its final place is the first peculiarity of doliolid reproduction. Buds are immobile, but are actively carried by special mobile cells, called phorocytes, which literally means [...] "carrier cells", shaped like amoebae.

This open-state current, originating and amplified from a single-molecule event, is typically {{on the order of}} pA to nA, with time-resolution of approx. millisecond.

There are two parts of egocentric navigation that are evaluated, route-based navigation, a clearly <b>defined</b> <b>path</b> through an environment. The other part is path integrated navigation, the ability to take a different and more direct path to a starting location than the outbound path. Egocentric navigation is evaluated by observing the subjects and recording how many times the subject crosses a predetermined line at each T-intersection with their head and forepaws, indicating they are going in the wrong direction, or in other words, they are lost.|$|E

50|$|PDE {{occurs when}} the path defined in the RNAV system does not {{correspond}} to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. Use of an RNAV system for navigation presupposes that a <b>defined</b> <b>path</b> representing the intended track is loaded into the navigation database. A consistent, repeatable path cannot be defined for a turn that allows for a fly-by turn at a waypoint (because nearness to waypoint and wind vector may not be repeatable), requires a fly-over of a waypoint (because wind vector may not be repeatable), or {{occurs when the}} aircraft reaches a target altitude (because target altitude is dependent on engine thrust and aircraft weight). In these cases, the navigation database contains a point-to-point desired flight path, but cannot account for the RNAV system defining a fly-by or fly-over path and performing a maneuver. A meaningful PDE and FTE cannot be established without a defining path, resulting in variability in the turn. Also, a deterministic, repeatable path cannot be defined for paths based on heading and the resulting path variability is accommodated in the route design.|$|E
