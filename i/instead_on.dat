5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best.

5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus <b>instead</b> <b>on</b> the description of observable behavior.|$|E

His decision not to attend {{the opening ceremony}} was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.|$|E

In 1964 he was chosen as head of the Department of Military History. He also worked as a lecturer at UI.|$|E

Seeing the Spitfire, it turned in for an attack; Johnson took cover under his fighter while the airfield defences shot down the 109. On 16 April 1945 Johnson's Wing moved to RAF Celle in Germany.|$|E
