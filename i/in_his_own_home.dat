5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

De Morgan believed that his career as a scientist might have been affected if he had revealed his interest in the study of spiritualism so he helped to publish the book anonymously.

25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> and for his own use. At the same time, Justice Brennan was wavering on affirming based {{on the presence of}} non-infringing uses of the technology—but Brennan was not prepared to say that making home copies for repeated personal use did not constitute an infringement. Justice White, noting Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need not be resolved, because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of the technology that enabled them.|$|E

25|$|The Trinity Church {{congregation}} {{was established}} by Henry Trigg, a practising Congregationalist, who arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1829. Trigg initially attended the first Anglican Church, {{where he was a}} choirmaster. He later joined the Wesleyans, but from 1843 he held prayer meetings in the Congregational tradition <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> In 1845 a number of the Congregationalists met to discuss the building of a chapel, and a £3 subscription was agreed upon. Following this a site in William Street was obtained and on 6 September 1846 the first Congregational Chapel was opened. Within twelve months the building was enlarged to seat nearly 200 people. In the following six years, Trigg conducted all the services until, in 1852, the London Missionary Society sent out the Reverend James Leonard to be the first ordained Congregational minister. Leonard only stayed for three years before leaving the congregation in 1855. In 1858 the Congregational Church closed until the early 1860s, when Trigg set about reviving the cause. In October 1862 the Reverend James Innes became pastor of the Perth congregation.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} up his {{university}} place Coates sailed to New South Wales in 1864 {{and became an}} assistant master at the newly founded Newington College, Sydney. In 1873 he moved to Fort Street School and after serving in schools at West Maitland and William Street, Sydney he became headmaster of Fort Street in 1876. He served only six months at Fort Street before briefly visiting England and in 1877 succeeding Dr Michael Howe as headmaster of Newington. During his six years there the college moved in 1880 from Silverwater to Stanmore and enrolments trebled. Under Coates's guidance the college established a high reputation for sport and for scholarship. He was the first captain in its cadet corps, and it is claimed that in 1869 Newington became the first Australian school to play Rugby union. Coates played in both the Rugby and cricket teams and was an important influence on two Old Newingtonians who were early members of the Australian cricket team - Tom Garrett and Edwin Evans. In September 1883 he successfully applied for the headmastership of the newly founded Sydney Boys' High School. Of the six public high schools begun in 1883 only three survived their early years, {{and the success of}} Sydney Boys' High School was due in large measure to Coates's dedication, leadership and inspiration. Several country boys were able to attend the school only because he took them as boarders <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> Despite a reputation as a stern disciplinarian he was highly esteemed and respected by his pupils, who responded to his deep knowledge of boys and to his rare gift for teaching. In 1892 High moved from Elizabeth Street, Sydney to a new site at Ultimo. Coates retired in June 1896 and after two severe strokes died at his home in Paddington.|$|E
