5000|$|... cAMP and cGMP mediate several {{cellular}} responses such as acrosomal exocytosis, or {{the fusion}} of the male sperm to the female egg, and chemotaxis. In the sea urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, speract, a short peptide, was studied. Speract activates a receptor-type guanylate cyclase (GC) and stimulates a rise in intracellular cGMP concentrations. Speract also increases the concentration of calcium. Although there {{has yet to be}} any establishment of a direct causal relationship, the previously mentioned observations suggest that cGMP activates calcium conductance. CNG channels are prime candidates for the calcium-entry pathway, due to their high calcium permeability. CNG channels have yet to be detected by <b>homology</b> <b>screening.</b> In mammals, the testicular CNG channel subunits that are expressed are A3, B1, and B3. Heterologous expression of the A3 subunit was cloned from testis and produced channels that were cGMP sensitive and selective. It is possible that these channels are involved in a cGMP-stimulated calcium flux into the sperm. However a more extensive characterization of the channel has not been accomplished due to the low success rate of detecting channel activity. Since A3 subunit knockout mice are fertile, CNG channels could be involved in some form of motility control and even in chemotactic swimming behavior or in the acrosomal exocytosis. However, a receptor-type GC in mammalian sperm has yet to be identified. Mouse sperm express other channels such as CatSper1. Male sterility can be accomplished by disrupting the CatSper1 gene; additionally, the cAMP-induced calcium influx is abolished in mutant mice. Although CatSper need additional subunits to become functional, they are unrelated to CNG channels because CatSper lacks a cAMP/cGMP-binding site. It is possible that CNG and CatSper subunits assemble to form calcium-permeable and cyclic nucleotide-sensitive ion channels.|$|E
5000|$|Functional or <b>homology</b> <b>screening</b> {{strategies}} {{have been used}} to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific phenotypes that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify conserved sequences that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules. Functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an agar plate. Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search genes with specific functions. These led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, the Schipper group identified three eDNA derived AHL lactonases that inhibit biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays. However, these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system. In contrast, homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously. The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, Banik et al. screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin-like glycopeptide antibiotics and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters. In addition, an in silico examination from the Global Ocean Metagenomic Survey found 20 new lantibiotic cyclases. [...] There are challenges to metagenomic approaches to discover new biologically active molecules. Only 40% of enzymatic activities present in a sample can be expressed in E. coli.. In addition, the purification and isolation of eDNA is essential but difficult when the sources of obtained samples are poorly understood. However, collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including bacterial genetics, molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, robots, synthetic biology, and chemistry can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an assay for intermolecular crossing over between circular plasmids carrying variable amounts of <b>homology.</b> <b>Screens</b> of Escherichia coli mutants demonstrated that known recombination functions can only partially account for the observed recombination. Recombination rates increased three to four orders of magnitude as homology rose from 25 to 411 bp. Loss of recA blocked most recombination; however, RecA-independent crossing over predominated at 25 bp and could be detected at all homology lengths. Products of recA-independent recombination were reciprocal in nature. This suggests that RecA-independent recombination may involve a true break-and-join mechanism, but the genetic basis for this mechanism remains unknown. RecA-dependent crossing over occurred primarily by the RecF pathway but considerable recombination occurred independent of both RecF and RecBCD. In many respects, the genetic dependence of RecA-dependent crossing over resembled that reported for single-strand gap repair. Surprisingly, ruvC mutants, in both recA(+) and recA mutant backgrounds, scored as hyperrecombinational. This may occur because RuvC preferentially resolves Holliday junction intermediates, critical to both RecA-dependent and RecA-independent mechanisms, to the noncrossover configuration. Levels of crossing over were increased by defects in DnaB helicase and by oxidative damage, showing that damaged DNA or stalled replication can initiate genetic recombination...|$|R
40|$|Leukodystrophies are {{hereditary}} central {{white matter}} disorders caused by oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Recent clinical trials {{for some of}} these devastating neurological conditions have employed an ex vivo gene therapy approach that showed improved endpoints because cross-correction of affected myelin-forming cells occurred following secretion of therapeutic proteins by transduced autologous grafts. However, direct gene transfer to oligodendrocytes is required for the majority of leukodystrophies with underlying mutations in genes encoding non-secreted oligodendroglial proteins. Recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are versatile tools for gene transfer to the central nervous system and proof-of-concept studies in rodents have shown that the use of cellular promoters is sufficient to target AAV-mediated transgene expression to glia. The potential of this strategy has not been exploited. The major caveat of the AAV system is its limited packaging capacity of ~ 5 kb, providing the rationale for identifying small yet selective recombinant promoters. Here, we characterize the human myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) promoter for reliable targeting of AAV-mediated transgene expression to oligodendrocytes in vivo. A <b>homology</b> <b>screen</b> revealed highly conserved genomic regions among mammalian species upstream of the transcription start site. Recombinant AAV expression cassettes carrying the cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by truncated versions of the recombinant MAG promoter (2. 2 kb, 1. 5 kb and 0. 3 kb in size) were packaged as cy 5 vectors and delivered into the dorsal striatum of mice. At three weeks post-injection, oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes expressing the reporter were quantified by immunohistochemical staining. Our results revealed that both 2. 2 kb and 1. 5 kb MAG promoters targeted more than 95 % of transgene expression to oligodendrocytes. Even the short 0. 3 kb fragment conveyed high oligodendroglial specific transgene expression (> 90 %) in vivo. Moreover, cy 5 -MAG 2. 2 -GFP delivery to the neonate CNS resulted in selective GFP expression in oligodendrocytes for at least eight months. Broadly, the characterization of the extremely short yet oligodendrocyte-specific human MAG promoter may facilitate modelling neurological diseases caused by oligodendrocyte pathology and has translational relevance for leukodystrophy gene therapy...|$|R

40|$|The {{balance of}} {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation {{in the cell}} is maintained by the opposing actions of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Investigation into tyrosine phosphorylation was initially focused on the action of PTKs. However, research {{over the past decade}} has revealed that PTPs also {{play a key role in}} signal transduction. The multi-protein complexes that constitute the cell-cell adhesions in endothelial and epithelial tissues are dynamically restructured in response to extracellular and intracellular signalling. Tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of both adherens junctions and tight junctions. Inhibitors of PTPs have been shown to disrupt cell-cell adhesions indicating that PTPs are important in maintaining adhesion integrity. The maintenance of a selectively permeable barrier is an essential function of endothelial cells, which are the cells that line the lumen of blood vessels. Therefore, it is important to understand the normal functioning of the proteins in the cell-cell adhesion complexes. The aims of this research were to ascertain which members of the PTP family are expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to characterise a PTP that may potentially be involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesions. A <b>homology</b> <b>screen</b> identified a cytosolic phosphatase, PTP-Pez, to be highly expressed in HUVEC. The presence of the protein-protein interaction FERM domain (band 4. 1, ezrin, radixin and moesin) at the N-terminus of Pez predicted its localisation to the plasma membrane. Specific antibodies showed that in confluent monolayers Pez is cytoplasmic and concentrated at intercellular junctions but the protein is nuclear in sub-confluent cells. The adherens junction protein β-catenin and the tight junction protein occludin were both identified as potential substrates of Pez using a "substrate-trapping" approach. Data showing that Pez bound to and dephosphorylated β-catenin in vivo further substantiated this. A truncated form of Pez lacking the catalytic domain acted as a dominant negative mutant inhibiting the dephosphorylation of its substrates at intercellular junctions and enhancing cell motility. Canine epithelial cells overexpressing Pez underwent an apparent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process typified by downregulation of cell-cell contacts. These findings indicate that Pez plays a role in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Dept. of Medicine, 200...|$|R

In Bacillus subtilis, {{a family of four}} anti-terminator proteins controls the expression of genes for the utilisation of alternative sugars. These regulatory systems contain the anti-terminator proteins and a RNA structure, the RNA anti-terminator (RAT) that is bound by the anti-terminator proteins. We have studied three of these proteins (SacT, SacY, and LicT) to understand how they can transmit a specific signal in spite of their strong structural <b>homology.</b> A <b>screen</b> for random mutations that render SacT capable to bind a RNA structure recognized by LicT only revealed a substitution (P 26 S) at one of the few non-conserved residues that are in contact with the RNA. We have randomly modified this position in SacT together with another non-conserved RNA-contacting residue (Q 31). Surprisingly, the mutant proteins could bind all RAT structures that are present in B. subtilis. In a complementary approach, reciprocal amino acid exchanges have been introduced in LicT and SacY at non-conserved positions of the RNA-binding site. This analysis revealed the key role of an arginine side-chain for both the high affinity and specificity of LicT for its cognate RAT. Introduction of this Arg at the equivalent position of SacY (A 26) increased the RNA binding in vitro but also resulted in a relaxed specificity.

When transiently expressed in COS- 7 cells this receptor did not bind any of the typical μ, δ or κ opioid receptor ligands with high affinity. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that LC 132 mRNA is highly expressed in several rat brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, subfornical organ, habenula, hypothalamus, central gray, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Based on this distribution and its high homology with the μ, δ and κ opioid receptors, it is proposed that LC 132 is a new member of the opioid receptor family that is involved in analgesia {{and the perception of}} pain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{isolated}} splice {{variants of}} the AMIH cDNA {{by means of}} polymerase chain reaction and <b>homology</b> <b>screening.</b> Splicing at one site generates at least four different channel transcripts (AMIH, AMIHL, AMIHM and AMIHT), which code for ion-channel proteins that vary in the interloop regions between the membrane-spanning domains S 4 and S 5. HEK 293 cells in which the AMIHL splice variants were functionally expressed generated currents that were activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Compared to AMIH, AMIHL cells showed pronounced differences in the voltage dependency of activation: the incorporation of 32 extra amino acids between S 4 and S 5 shifts the activation curve by + 25 mV. Intracellular cAMP made the current-activation potential still less negative and accelerated the activation more effectively than it does in AMIH cells. In vertebrates, functional diversity of Ih-channels is generated by four different genes. In Apis mellifera, splice variants coded by the single gene AMIH could generate a similar diversity...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus licheniformis l-arabinose {{isomerase}} (l-AI) {{is distinguished}} from other l-AIs by its {{high degree of}} substrate specificity for l-arabinose and its high turnover rate. A systematic strategy that included a sequence alignment-based first screening of residues and a <b>homology</b> model-based second <b>screening,</b> followed by site-directed mutagenesis to alter individual screened residues, was used to study the molecular determinants for the catalytic efficiency of B. licheniformis l-AI. One conserved amino acid, Y 333, in the substrate binding pocket of the wild-type B. licheniformis l-AI was identified as an important residue affecting the catalytic efficiency of B. licheniformis l-AI. Further insights into the function of residue Y 333 were obtained by replacing it with other aromatic, nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids or polar amino acids. Replacing Y 333 with the aromatic amino acid Phe did not alter catalytic efficiency toward l-arabinose. In contrast, the activities of mutants containing a hydrophobic amino acid (Ala, Val, or Leu) at position 333 decreased as {{the size of the}} hydrophobic side chain of the amino acid decreased. However, mutants containing hydrophilic and charged amino acids, such as Asp, Glu, and Lys, showed almost no activity with l-arabinose. These data and a molecular dynamics simulation suggest that Y 333 is involved in the catalytic efficiency of B. licheniformis l-AI...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to identify the novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on porcine follicle stimulating hormone b subunit (FSH b) genes. Moreover, their association with litter size traits in commercial pigs will be analyzed. 1, 155 Large White x Landrace crossbred sows were bled and DNA was extracted. The records included total number of piglet born (TNB), number of piglet born alive (NBA), number of piglets stillbirth (SB) and number of piglets mummified (MM). The known sequence of porcine FSH b (GenBank accession no. D 00621. 1) was <b>screened</b> <b>homology</b> to known sequences in term of express sequenced tags (ESTs) in public domain, GenBank. The primers were designed for amplified the novel Bsu RI-c. 930 A>G- FSH b fragment which confirmed by PCR-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing then genotyping.   The favorable cut homozygous G/G allele was highly significant higher than A/G allele in terms of TNB and NBA. While, published marker Hae III- g. 5894 A>G-FSH b was not significant difference in any litter traits. For haplotype analysis, c. 930 A>G- g. 5894 A>G of FSH?, unfavorable GG/AA haplotype was significantly lower TNB and NBA than other haplotypes. Conversely, this haplotype was significantly higher MM than others. The study concluded that Bsu RI-c. 930 A>G and the haplotype of Hae III-g. 5894 A>G - Bsu RI-c. 930 A>G of FSH b may used for marker-assisted selection on pig breeding program. </p...|$|R
40|$|The neuropeptide galanin mediates {{a diverse}} {{spectrum}} of biological activities by interacting with specific G protein-coupled receptors. We have used <b>homology</b> genomic library <b>screening</b> and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) techniques to isolate both genomic and cDNA clones encoding the human homolog of the recently cloned rat GALR 2 galanin receptor. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene encoding human GALR 2 (GALNR 2) has been localized to chromosome 17 q 25. 3. The two coding exons of the human GALNR 2 gene, interrupted by an intron positioned {{at the end of}} transmembrane domain III, encode a 387 amino acid G protein-coupled receptor with 87 % overall amino acid identity with rat GALR 2. In HEK- 293 cells stably expressing human GALR 2, binding of [125 I]porcine galanin is saturable and can be displaced by galanin, amino-terminal galanin fragments and chimeric galanin peptides but not by carboxy-terminal galanin fragments. In HEK- 293 cells, human GALR 2 couples both to Galphaq/ 11 to stimulate phospholipase C and increase intracellular calcium levels and to Galphai/o to inhibit forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation. A wide tissue distribution is observed by reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR analysis, with human GALR 2 mRNA being detected {{in many areas of the}} human central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues.
