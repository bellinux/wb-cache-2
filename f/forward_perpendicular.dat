40|$|Hull form {{optimization}} from a hydrodynamic performance {{point of}} view is an important aspect of ship design. This study presents a computational method to estimate the ship seakeeping in regular head wave. In the optimization process the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is linked to the computational method to obtain an optimum hull form by taking into account the displacement as design constraint. New hull forms are obtained from the well-known S 60 hull and the classical Wigley hull taken as initial hulls in the optimization process at two Froude numbers (Fn= 0. 2 and Fn= 0. 3). The optimization variables are a combination of ship hull offsets and main dimensions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} g(0), or equivalently the effective strip half-width, {{using data from}} a line transect survey which has been operated in double observer mode {{only a small fraction}} of the time. By letting the proportion of double observer effort approach zero, by increasingly masking data from one of the observers, we find that the estimate of g(0) does not break down.

The spontaneous fluorescence of daunomycin was measured upon excitation with laser light at 488 nm. <b>Forward</b> and <b>perpendicular</b> light scatters of the cells were simultaneously measured to allow identification of granulocytic and lymphocytic subpopulations. A linear relationship was found for a 30 -min exposure between the drug concentration (ranging from 0. 2 to 3 /Â¿g/ml) in the incubation medium and the fluorescence intensity for both lymphocytes and granulocytes. Dead cells contaminating cell suspensions showed several times higher daunomycin fluorescence than did viable cells.

40|$|Magnetic {{spectra of}} the {{electrons}} ejected by x-rays from thin metallic films at angles ranging from 0 ° to 180 ° {{with the direction}} of the x-ray beam have been obtained by the method of Robinson, de Broglie, and Whiddington. To the degree of accuracy of the measurements (one-half of one percent) the maximum velocity of ejection is exactly the same in all directions. With thin foils of the heavier elements the number of electrons leaving the foil with this maximum velocity in the various directions (determined by the intensity of the edges) is approximately the same. With radiators of small density, or with sputtered films so thin that Wentzel's criterion for "single" scattering holds, the number of electrons leaving the foil is greatest in a direction a little <b>forward</b> of <b>perpendicular</b> to {{the direction of the}} x-ray beam. Rutherford's theory of nuclear scattering applied to electrons gives an explanation of these results if the assumption is made that all the electrons start out from the atom in the same direction...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{reconstruction}} from sets of {{cross-sectional data}} {{is important in}} a variety of applications. The problem of generating a ship hull surface from non-regular cross-sectional curves is addressed. Generating non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) surfaces that represent cross-sectional curves is a challenge, since the number of control points is growing due to the non-avoidable process of having compatible cross-sectional curves. A new NURBS parameterization method that yields a minimum number of control points, and is adequate in generating a smooth and fair NURBS surface for ship hulls is proposed. This method allows for multiple knots and close domain knots. The results of applying different parameterization methods on the <b>forward</b> <b>perpendicular</b> (FP) region of a ship hull (organized in eight sections) shows that the proposed method reduces the number of control points and generates a smooth and fair NURBS surface, without sacrificing the original object shape of the FP region...|$|E
40|$|Global hydroelastic effects due to wetdeck {{slamming}} on a catamaran at Froude numbers between 0. 30 and 0. 33 {{in regular}} head waves are studied theoretically and experimentally. The wetdeck has a horizontal transverse cross-section. The important elastic {{properties of the}} experimental model are theoretically accounted for by using small elastic beam elements connecting three rigid bodies. The hydrodynamic loads on the side hulls {{are based on the}} strip theory by Salvesen et al. (1970) without hull interaction. The forward speed causes end terms at the forward ends of the second and third body counted from <b>forward</b> <b>perpendicular</b> (FP). A modal based method is used to include heave, pitch, two-node and three-node vertical bending modes. The three-body theoretical model without wetdeck slamming agrees well with experimental eigenvalues, relative vertical motions at the bow, vertical shear forces and bending moments at two transverse cuts. Mode shapes agree with Finite Element Method (FEM) results. Five analytically based wetdeck slamming models are presented. The structure is locally rigid and the flow due to slamming is two-dimensional in a longitudinal cross-sectional plane. It is shown sufficient from a global response point of view, to use a Von Karman type of method and a linear approximation of the relative impact velocity. The effect of high forward speed on the slamming loads is investigated by modifying the dynamic free surface condition and including a Kutta condition at the aft end of the wetted deck. The flow is mathematically equivalent to the 2 D linear unsteady lifting problem of a thin foil in infinite fluid. An important difference is that the wetted length is time dependent. The Kutta condition model may matter. Both the water entry and exit phases during the slamming are important for global response. The theory gives generally good agreement with experimental results for slamming loads and wetdeck slamming induced global vertical shear forces and bending moments at the two transverse cuts. However, there is one slamming case with unsatisfactory agreement. This is believed to be due to the neglection of piston mode resonance of the fluid motion between the two side hulls. Both theory and experiments show a strong influence of two-node bending on global loads. There is also some influence of the three-node bending, but this is not satisfactorily predicted. An error analysis in the experiments is made for the most severe slamming case. Since the experiments were not done as a part of this thesis and each test condition was done only once, random errors can not be identified. Systematic errors are discussed and error estimates of experimentally predicted vertical shear forces and bending moments are made by extensively using the theoretical model. It is shown that the trim angle is the most important error source. The changing incident wave amplitudes along the track of the model and the wave measurement inaccuracies are equally the second most important error source for vertical bending moment at the two transverse cuts investigated in the experiments. The error associated with roll, yaw and sway is the second most important for vertical shear force at the two cuts. The estimated combined relative errors in experimentally predicted vertical shear forces and bending moments are between 0. 17 and 0. 29. Error sources in the theory are also discussed. Since no benchmark theoretical model that properly includes all physical effects exists, we must to some extent rely on experimental results. The discussion covers side hull hydrodynamics and hull interaction, slamming modelling, structural modelling and effect of transient phase. It is shown that hydrodynamic hull interaction may matter. A future perspective is to develop a numerical method that can predict wetdeck slamming induced global response of multihull vessels in any sea state and at any forward speed. This involves long term statistical description of combined load effects due to both transient slamming induced whipping and steady state linear and nonlinear wave loads. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|During migration, birds {{can show}} {{different}} responses to wind {{in relation to}} distance to the goal, experience, ecological barriers and visibility of landmarks. We analysed the effect of wind (tailwinds and crosswinds) on daily movement rates (<b>forward</b> and <b>perpendicular)</b> of Eleonora’s falcons using ARGOS satellite telemetry, during their trans-continental autumn migration to Madagascar, {{in relation to the}} different crossed regions and individuals’ age class. Our results showed that the effect of wind on daily movement rates was not uniform, being stronger in the farthest region from the migration goal, the Sahara desert, with adults being more affected than juveniles in this region. In the Sahel, the results were more conflicting, perhaps because daily movements were more shaped by the distribution of food resources. In Equatorial Africa, daily movement rates were mainly affected by crosswinds. Still, it remains unclear which orientation mechanism allows Eleonora’s falcons to reach such a narrow wintering area compensating also for wind displacement.

40|$|Measuring {{the optical}} {{activity}} from an ensemble of chiral molecules {{is a common}} tool to know their stereo-structure. These measurements are done in the same propagation direction of the probe beam of light, {{because that is the}} direction where most signal is emitted. We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that, even though other interesting information may be gathered when collecting light emitted in other directions, for most molecules, the phenomenon of optical activity is only present in the forward scattering direction. The fundamental reason behind this is that forward scattered light preserves the circular polarization states due to the cylindrical symmetry of the system, an essential requirement for optical activity. An important exemption happens in dual molecules, i. e., molecules which present the same response to electric and magnetic fields. We present a series of experiments measuring the optical activity and the scattering of chiral solutions in the <b>forward</b> and <b>perpendicular</b> directions. We experimentally show that these molecules present optical activity and preservation of circular polarization in the forward direction, while the polarization pattern in non-forward directions is much more complex and, in particular, does not preserve the circular polarization. Finally, we show that when probing the particle with different wavelengths, the scattering in non-forward directions presents some interesting structural features which are hidden in the forward measurements. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} curtain {{array antenna}} produced a horizontally polarised signal that was directed strongly <b>forward</b> along the <b>perpendicular</b> {{to the line}} of the towers. This direction was known as the line of shoot, and was generally aimed out over the water. The broadcast pattern covered an area of about 100 degrees in a roughly fan-shaped area, with a smaller side lobe to the rear, courtesy of the reflectors, and much smaller ones to the sides. When the signal reflected off the ground it underwent a ½ wavelength phase-change, which caused it to interfere with the direct signal. The result was a series of vertically-stacked lobes about 5 degrees wide from 1 degree off the ground to the vertical. The system was later expanded by adding another set of four additional antennas closer to the ground, wired in a similar fashion.|$|R
40|$|During migrations, {{birds have}} to cope with varying {{meteorological}} conditions, which shape their migratory routes and affect their performance. Amongst these, wind is the main meteorological agent influencing behaviour of birds in their migration journeys. Here we analyze the effect of winds during migrations of adult individuals of two raptor species tracked with satellite telemetry, the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) and the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). While harriers use mostly soaring flight, kestrels principally use flapping flight and thus, wind can differently affect these birds. We found that both <b>forward</b> and <b>perpendicular</b> winds significantly affected the movements of the Montagu’s harrier, which were drifted from their intended direction but also took advantage of tailwinds. On the contrary, lesser kestrels moved more regardless of forward winds, despite they were highly drifted by crosswinds. Our results also support that the drifting effect of winds {{at the onset of the}} spring migration may explain the loop migration observed for both species, with birds compensating later the effect of crosswinds to arrive to their breeding areas. Results presented here illustrate how winds can differently affect migrating birds according to their flight modes. R.

40|$|Loop {{migration}} among birds {{is characterized}} by the spring route lying consistently west or east of the autumn route. The existence of loops has been explained by general wind conditions or seasonal differences in habitat distribution. Loop migration has predominantly been studied at the population level, for example by analysing ring recoveries. Here we study loop migration of individual marsh harriers Circus aeruginosus tracked by satellite telemetry. We show that despite a generally narrow migration corridor the harriers travelled in a distinct clockwise loop through Africa and southern Europe, following more westerly routes in spring than in autumn. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify potential feeding habitat in Africa. Suitable habitat seemed always more abundant along the western route, both in spring and autumn, and no important stopover site was found along the eastern route. Observed routes did thus not coincide with seasonal variation in habitat availability. However, favourable habitat might be more important during spring migration, when the crossing of the Sahara seems more challenging, and thus habitat availability might play an indirect role in the harriers' route choice. Grid-based wind data were used to reconstruct general wind patterns, and in qualitative agreement with the observed loop marsh harriers predominantly encountered westerly winds in Europe and easterly winds in Africa, both in autumn and in spring. By correlating tail- and crosswinds with <b>forward</b> and <b>perpendicular</b> movement rates, respectively, we show that marsh harriers are partially drifted by wind. Thus, we tentatively conclude that wind rather than habitat seems to have an overriding effect on the shape of the migration routes of marsh harriers. General wind conditions seem {{to play an important role}} also in the evolution of narrow migratory loops as demonstrated for individual marsh harriers...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} operating, scanning x-ray {{machine is}} being developed for landmine detection using backscattered x-rays. The source operates at 130 kV and 650 mA. The x-rays are formed by electrons striking a high Z target. Target shape is an approximate 5 cm wide by 210 cm long racetrack. The electron beam is scanned across this target with electromagnets. There are 105, 1 -cm by 1 -cm collimators in each leg of the racetrack {{for a total of}} 210 collimators. The source is moved in the <b>forward</b> direction(the direction <b>perpendicular</b> to the 210 -cm dimension) at 3 mi/h. The forward velocity and collimator spacing are such that a grid of collimated x-rays are projected at normal incidence to the soil. The spacing between the collimators and the ground results in a 2 -cm by 2 -cm x-ray pixel on the ground. A unique detector arrangement of collimated and uncollimated detectors allows surface features to be recognized and removed, leaving an image of a buried landmine. Another detector monitors the uncollimated x-ray output and is used to normalize the source output. The mine detector is being prepared for an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The ATD is scheduled for midyear of 1998. The results of the source performance in pre ATD tests will be presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} funded by the Greenland Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum, the Danish Cooperation of the Environment in the Arctic (DANCEA, Danish Ministry of the Environment) and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. Decisions about {{sustainable}} exploitation levels of marine resources are often based on inadequate data, but are nevertheless required for practical purposes. We describe one exception where abundance estimates spanning 30  years and catch data spanning more than 40  years were used in a Bayesian assessment model of belugas Delphinapterus leucas off West Greenland. The model was updated with data from a visual aerial survey on the wintering ground in 2012. Methods that take account of stochastic animal availability by using independent estimates of <b>forward</b> and <b>perpendicular</b> sighting distances were used to estimate beluga abundance. A model that appears to be robust to the presence of a few large groups yielded an estimate of 7456 belugas (cv =  0. 44), similar to a conventional distance-sampling estimate. A mark–recapture distance analysis that corrects for perception and availability bias estimated the abundance to be 9072 whales (cv =  0. 32). Increasing distance of beluga sightings from shore was correlated with decreasing sea ice cover, suggesting that belugas expand their distribution offshore (i. e. westward in this context) with the reduction of coastal sea ice. A model with high (0. 98) adult survival estimated a decline from 18   600 (90 % CI: 13   400, 26   000) whales in 1970 to 8000 (90 % CI: 5830, 11   200) in 2004. The decline was probably a result of a period with exceptionally large catches. Following the introduction of catch limits in 2004, the model projects an increase to 11   600 (90 % CI: 6760, 17   600) individuals in 2020 (assuming annual removals of 294 belugas after 2014). If the annual removal level is fixed at 300 individuals, a low-survival (0. 97) model predicts a 75 % probability of an increasing population during 2015 – 2020. Reduced removal rates due to catch limits and the more offshore, less accessible distribution of the whales are believed to be responsible for the initial signs of population recovery.

40|$|A method {{described}} to purify pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells (PHSC) from adult mouse bone marrow. The method {{consists of three}} separation steps. First, bone marrow cells are centrifuged in a discontinuous metrizamide gradient and simultaneously labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (WGA-FITC). Second, the low density cells are analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and the WGA-positive cells with medium <b>forward</b> and low <b>perpendicular</b> light scatter intensities are sorted. The WGA-FITC {{is removed from the}} cells by incubation with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Finally, the sorted cells are incubated with anti-H- 2 K-biotin and avidin-FITC and sorted a second time to enrich cells with high H- 2 K density. The sorted cells gave rise to 2 spleen colonies per 100 injected cells at 8 d and 6. 6 colonies per 100 cells at 12 d after transplantation into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. The average enrichment factor for day 12 CFU-S (colony-forming unit/spleen) was 135 (range, 90 [...] 230; n = 15) and was similar to that for the cell type that provides radioprotection (180 +/- 70), indicating that these functional properties were copurified. Indirect evidence suggests that the spleen-seeding efficiency (f factor) of these cells is 0. 10 and, therefore, the average purity of the sorted PHSC was 65 % (range in 15 experiments, 35 [...] 110 %). The sorted cells were all in the G 1 or G 0 phase of the cell cycle. They appeared to be undifferentiated blasts by morphological criteria. Electron microscopy revealed that the sorted cells consisted primarily of two cell types, possibly representing G 0 and G 1 cells. The FACS was used to deposit single selected cells into individual microwells of Terasaki trays. 32 % of the sorted cells could be induced to form myeloid progeny in vitro. This procedure should be useful for direct studies on the regulation of hemopoietic cell differentiation...|$|R
