Three key factors determine the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> value: (1) the environmental compartment under consideration, with its dimensions and the accounted for, (2) the desired level of environmental protection and (3) the scenario applying to the intended use of the construction material. <b>Emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> have been derived here from modelled concentrations in soil, groundwater and surface water. The desired level of protection has been elaborated as a stand-still approach (based on quality target values and a risk-based approach (based on PNECs). Two exposure models were used for taking the effects of a time-dependent exposure of the soil to leached components into account, for vertical transport through the soil profile and for retardation of components in the soil profile. The PEARL model was used for binding described by equilibrium adsorption. The ORCHESTRA model was used for binding that also takes speciation into account. For surface water, a dilution factor was computed assuming a certain mixing zone, dependent on the size of the surface water. The consequences of the proposed alternative <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> have been estimated on the basis of information in a database containing results of leaching tests for construction materials.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the possible evolution of emissions of {{primary particulate matter}} in Europe up to 2020 {{as a consequence of}} further economic development and progressing implementation of emission control legislation, in particular of the Protocols that also influence primary emissions of PM. Furthermore, it explores the potential for further PM emission reductions through extensions of the existing protocols (i) to additional countries, (ii) by stricter <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> and (iii) to other sectors. Based on the implementation of the RAINS model as it was used for the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) program of the European Commission, the report analyses three emission control cases: (i) the situation in the year 2000, (ii) the current legislation case for 2020, and (iii) a case with further control measures. Results are presented for three groups of countries: (i) the 15 old Member States of the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, (ii) the 10 new Member States, and (iii) the other countries in Europe including the European area of Russia and Turkey. The analysis concludes that primary emissions of PM are expected to decline in the future due to current legislation, between 2000 and 2020 by approx. 40 - 45 percent in the EU- 25 and by 8 - 9 percent in the non-EU countries. Tightened <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> in a potential revision of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols would have a relatively small effect on total PM emissions in 2020, especially if the protocols would not receive ratifications from additional Parties. In the EU- 25, PM 2. 5 emissions would decline in 2020 at maximum by an additional 7 percent if the most advanced technical measures were implemented. A significantly larger reduction potential could be harvested through ratification and subsequent implementation of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols by additional Parties. This could reduce PM 2. 5 emissions in the non-EU countries by up to 25 percent in 2020 compared to the current legislation situation. While the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols contain obligations for PM emissions from certain emission sources, in 2020 the majority of PM emissions is expected to originate from sources for which these protocols do not specify <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> For the EU- 25, about 80 percent of the identified technical potential for further PM reductions emerges from sources that are not covered in the Protocols.

European Commission has established integrated pollution prevention and control directive and directives concerning large combustion plants (LCP) and waste incineration (WI) plants to prevent emissions from industrial installations. The LCP and WI directives set the lowest requirements such as <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> and monitoring requirements that the operators have to comply in EU. European Commission has also published best available technique (BAT) reference documents to help authorities determine the requirements in environmental permits for the installations. This thesis is looking into the authority requirements for continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are set by the competent authorities in Spain, Estonia, France, Poland, Czech and UK. Power plants have to monitor and report air emissions {{with the help of}} CEMS. It consists of measurement equipment, analysers and sample conditioning systems as well as environmental data management solution. Directives and standards set the requirements for the CEMS, but still requirements differ between the target countries. For instance, according to the study only in UK certification (MCERTS) for the analyser is required and only in Spain plant owner is not allowed to perform the compliance reporting of the plants emissions. It is the responsibility of competent authority. Also the charging and trading emissions differ between the target countries. The coming directive on industrial emissions will be possibly accepted in the end of 2010. It will unify and straiten the requirements. <b>Emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> will lower and the emission monitoring requirements will be stricter.

40|$|Wastewater {{arising from}} the Coachford {{agglomeration}} is treated at the existing Coachford Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). This wastewater treatment facility has a primary treatment only with a design capacity of 450 population equivalent (PE) and it discharges the effluent into the Inniscarra Reservoir. The discharge from Coachford WWTP has been identified by the Lower Lee - Owenboy Water Management Unit Action Plan (WMUAP) as a point source pressure on {{the waters of the}} Lower Lee - Owenboy catchment and also as a cause of the strongly eutrophic status of Inniscarra Reservoir water quality by the EPA in 2009. Therefore, new <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (ELVs) for the main water quality parameters in the effluent from Coachford WWTP have been proposed by the EPA to ensure compliance with the relevant water quality standards downstream of effluent discharging point. For lakes, the most important water parameters are phosphorus and nitrogen and the relevant environmental quality standards define permissible concentrations for total phosphorus and total ammonia as 0. 025 mg/l and 0. 14 mg/l respectively. The new ELVs will be implemented by the end of 2018 after {{the construction of a new}} WWTP in Coachford. The impact of the new ELVs on water quality of receiving water has been examined by a previous assimilative capacity model developed by NUI Galway. This model used effluent discharge loading reflecting the current number of population in Coachford. However, an increase in the PE of the agglomeration is expected in the future and there is a need to predict the impact of the increased effluent loading from Coachford WWTP on the receiving water. An analogous assimilative capacity model to the NUI Galway (NUIG) model has been developed in this study based on simple mass balance computation. The newly developed model was used to predict concentrations of main water quality parameters downstream of effluent discharging point due to: (1) increased effluent discharge loadings representing the projected increase in number of population in Coachford agglomeration while maintaining the proposed ELVs; (2) a range of ELVs to test the effect of increasing the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> on the water quality of the downstream reach of the lake. The calibrated MBAC model was then used to estimate the concentration (Cout) of TP and TAmmonia at the complete mixing zone downstream of the discharge point of Coachford under: (i) a range of Qeff scenarios representing the projected increase in number of population in Coachford agglomeration; and (ii) a range of ELVs to test the effect of increasing the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> on the water quality of the downstream reach of the lake. The MBAC model predictions indicate that the concentrations of TP in the downstream complete mixing zone are unlikely to exceed the standard value of 0. 025 mg/l under the proposed ELV of 1. 2 mg/l and also under a higher value of 2. 0 mg/l for TP. However, if the ELV is increased to 5 or 10 mg/l the concentrations of TP in the downstream complete mixing zone is likely to exceed the standard value of 0. 025 mg/l under low flow conditions. The MBAC model predictions for TAmmonia indicate that under the tested ELVs (5, 6. 5, 10, and 15 mg/l), the concentrations of TAmmonia in the downstream complete mixing zone is unlikely to exceed the standard value of 0. 14 mg/l...|$|R

40|$|The {{competence}} {{to protect the}} environment in Europe could be described as a ‘shared’ competence. While the EU may adopt environmental directives on the basis of Article 192 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) that obligate Member States to implement them in their national legal order, Article 193 TFEU makes clear that the protective measures adopted pursuant to Article 192 TFEU shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures. A cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change is the 2005 Emission Trading System Directive (ETS Directive). This system {{is an example of a}} market based instrument for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from so-called ETS-installations. The 1996 Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC Directive) as well as its recently adopted successor, the Industrial Emissions Directive (IE Directive) represents a command-and-control instrument by demanding <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> to be set in national permits for so-called IPPC-installations. In order to clarify the interaction and guarantee a smooth interplay between the two directives, Article 9 (3) (iii) IPPC Directive was introduced in 2005. It provides that national permits issued under the IPPC Directive shall not contain an <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> (ELV) for direct emissions of greenhouse gases from ETS-installations unless necessary to ensure that no significant local pollution is caused. The intended strict division between the two regulatory systems has been challenged from a political and a legal perspective. [1] At the European level the European Parliament – during the legislative process for the IE Directive – discussed amendments that would explicitly allow Member States to adopt more stringent protective national measures, including greenhouse gas emission requirements for installations that are covered by the ETS Directive. The amendments aimed at clarifying the consequences of Article 193 TFEU but weren’t adopted. At the national level both the UK and the Netherlands have indicated the intention to adopt national standards for CO 2 emissions. They feel an increasing urgency to cut greenhouse gas emissions and therefore the need to use instruments other than the EU-ETS. This paper will focus on the legal question whether EU Member States are – in accordance with Article 193 TFEU – allowed to introduce ELV’s for CO 2 (command and control) for installations covered by the ETS Directive (marked based instrument).

Besides, <b>limit</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>values</b> were exceeded by three inorganic pollutants (suspended particles, NOx and HCl). Measurements in an industrial scenario test showed a high variability in air pollution emissions, suggesting the need of in situ testing for definitive implementation. With the experience collected in this and several previous works in the area of emissions related to the production of added sewage sludge ceramic, some guidelines and recommendations are given to minimize the environmental impact of ceramic production plants implementing this particular waste revalorization process. Guidelines cover different aspects: workplace implementation of gas cleaning equipment; geographical context and local wind pattern analysis; monitoring of emission and immission levels; and information policy through social control participation procedures for reporting of nuisance episodes.

40|$|Dioxins {{emissions}} from combustion plants are stringently regulated. In Europe, the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> is 0. 1 ng ITEQ/Nm 3 and this concentration is checked by manual sampling {{according to the}} European standard NF EN 1948. Automatic continuous sampling devices were developed and installed at stack during these 10 last years. These systems allow calculating more accurately the dioxins flow released yearly. No dioxins continuous emission monitoring system is operated today. They need very specific and sensitive technologies, not easy to run on site. Therefore the use of surrogate compounds {{could be a good}} alternative to simplify the real time monitoring of dioxins. The surrogate compound can be a precursor of dioxin formation or others organic molecules in flue gas, as, for instance, a single dioxin. For a good estimation of dioxin concentrations (I-TEQ value), it is necessary to have a good correlation between surrogate concentration and I-TEQ value. This study reports potential surrogate compounds of dioxins I-TEQ. Correlations have been assessed in laboratory from flue gas samples of several EfW plants. Then analytic methods are suggested to allow their on-line monitoring, with good specificity and sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the European Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control is to achieve an integrated approach of environmental protection by co-ordinating the authorization procedures of the competent authorities. However, by prescribing the permit licensing process to the Member States, the Directive strengthens the command-and-control approach in environmental policy. This approach hardly gives any economic incentives to promote developments of integrating environmental concerns into the planning and creation of products and production processes. Furthermore, the Directive reveals tendencies towards uniform Community environmental quality standards and <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> These tendencies towards increasing centralization at the EU level must be judged critically from the view-point of the economic Theory of Federalism. Public access to information on {{the environmental impact of}} processes ensured by this Directive, could lead to improvements of economic and ecological allocation and efficiency. Unfortunatly, the exact requirements of public information access are not specified by the Directive. Therefore, the prospective economic and ecological improvements might vanish in the legislation procedure of the Member States transposing the Directive into national law.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000 / 60 /EC) {{creates a}} {{legislative}} framework {{to manage and}} protect surface and groundwater resources in the European Union (EU). The WFD aims to achieve good ecological quality, and to prevent further deterioration of surface waters. Evaluation of the surface water quality {{should be based on}} the impact of anthropogenic pressures on aquatic ecosystems. Such requirements are novel in the European water policy, which has been mostly based on the regulation of <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> rather than assessment of the impacts. Evaluation of the ecological quality status of surface water bodies is based on biological quality elements such as phytoplankton, fish, and benthic flora and fauna. Biological indicators that are representative for those quality elements should allow classification of ecological quality based on functional relationships between pressures and indicators. Currently, it is a challenge to develop scientifically sound, high-precision, and practical classification tools {{that can be used for}} WFD compliant monitoring and assessment of ecological water quality targets. Further, to ensure comparable definition of good ecological status and a similar level of protection across the EU, WFD requires an intercalibration exercise to compare the results of the national ecological assessment systems.
