40|$|Abstract: Hearing {{threshold}} {{has been}} measured {{in a group}} of patients following cochlear implantation with a Clarion(R) device for the last eight years. The patients had received either a pre-curved carrier or the Hi-Focus I plus <b>Electrode</b> <b>Positioner</b> System (EPS). The assessment was carried out within the first postoperative week as well as at a later stage, between six and 87 months, post-operatively. Residual hearing thresholds were still measurable early after surgery in 24. 5 per cent of the patients, without differences between the two different Clarion(R) models. However, the number of subjects with measurable hearing dropped to 16. 3 per cent as observed when hearing was measured at a later stage, with an equal distribution between the two groups of patients. From this study it has been possible to observe that {{only a limited number of}} patients maintain residual hearing after Clarion(R) cochlear implantation, and that this tends to decrease further over time. Nevertheless, the performance of these patients for speech tests did not appear to be affected by deterioration of the pure-tone auditory threshold...|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} shortcoming {{of existing}} multichannel cochlear implants is electrical-field summation during simultaneous electrode stimulation. Electrical-field interactions can disrupt the stimulus waveform prior to neural activation. To test whether speech intelligibility can be degraded by electrical-field interaction, speech recognition performance and interaction were examined for three Clarion electrode arrays: the pre-curved, enhanced bipolar electrode array, the enhanced bipolar electrode with an <b>electrode</b> <b>positioner,</b> and the Hi-Focus electrode with a positioner. Channel interaction {{was measured by}} comparing stimulus detection thresholds for a probe signal {{in the presence of}} a sub-threshold perturbation signal as a function of the separation between the two simultaneously stimulated electrodes. Correct identification of vowels, consonants, and words in sentences was measured with two speech strategies: one which used simultaneous stimulation and another which used sequential stimulation. Speech recognition scores were correlated with measured electrical-field interaction for the strategy which used simultaneous stimulation but not the strategy which used sequential stimulation. Higher speech recognition scores with the simultaneous strategy were generally associated with lower levels of electrical-field interaction. Electrical-field interaction accounted for as much as 70 % of the variance in speech recognition scores, suggesting that electrical-field interaction is...|$|E
40|$|Averaged {{electrode}} voltages (AEVs) are {{of secondary}} importance for integrity testing of cochlear implant devices featuring back-telemetry. However, AEVs are device-independent and may show intermittent failures and deviant stimulation patterns unnoticed by telemetry. We collected AEVs from 18 {{users of the}} Clarion 1. 2 system and 6 users of the HiFocus system {{in order to establish}} norms for evaluating AEVs in difficult cases. The stimuli were presented with the standard clinical software. Monopolar stimulation at about 16 microA showed large AEVs (mean, 173 microV) suitable for integrity testing. No electrode failures were found. The AEV amplitudes from neighboring electrodes differed by less than 30 % (2 SD). The AEVs from subjects with the Clarion HiFocus electrode and/or the Clarion <b>electrode</b> <b>positioner</b> were within the normal range. The AEV amplitudes from bipolar stimulation were much more variable. Inversion of phases between electrodes was found in patients with an altered state of the cochlea (otosclerosis and osteogenesis imperfecta) and in a patient with a curled electrode tip. There was no correlation across subjects between AEVs and electrode impedances. Therefore, impedances are dominated by the electrode-tissue interface, in contrast to AEVs, which are determined by the volume conduction in the body...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} whether the electrical field created by a cochlear implant electrode is more focussed in a perimodiolar than in a medial position, voltages at non-stimulated electrodes were collected from the Clarion 1. 2 implant before and after insertion of the Clarion Electrode Positioning System. The positioner is inserted lateral to the electrode array and is intended to bring the array close to the medial wall of the scala tympani. These intracochlear electrode voltages (IEVs) were collected in 9 surgeries with the HiFocus I <b>electrode</b> array with <b>positioner.</b> Stapedius reflex thresholds were decreased after insertion of the positioner on 20 out of 22 electrodes. Electrode impedances did not increase significantly. IEVs increased slightly for all stimulated <b>electrodes.</b> However, the <b>positioner</b> did not significantly affect {{the slope of the}} IEVs for any of the stimulated electrodes. Individual differences between patients in the mean IEV amplitude were considerable; 2 patients deafened by otosclerosis showed particularly low amplitudes. Thus, IEVs provided no evidence of a focussing of the electrical field by introducing the positioner. Possible benefits of a perimodiolar position regarding efficiency and channel separation are discussed in terms of a reduced distance between electrodes and neural elements...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{hydrodynamic}} modulation voltammetry (HMV) is introduced, {{based on the}} microjet electrode (MJE) with an oscillating nozzle position. In MJE-HMV a jet of solution is fired at high velocities from a nozzle (with a typical diameter in the range 25 - 50 mu m) {{onto the surface of}} a disk ultramicroelectrode (UME). The mass transport rate to the electrode is modulated by oscillating the lateral position of the jet between two different coordinates: one where the jet impinges directly on the electrode surface and the other where the flowing stream (largely) misses the electrode. The resulting modulated (transport-limited) current in phase with the moving jet is quantitative and discriminates effectively against background processes. Studies of iridium (III) hexachloride (IrCl 63 -) oxidation at a Pt MJE serve to demonstrate the general capabilities of the technique. For this system, detection limits are estimated to be similar to 5 x 10 (- 9) mol dm(- 3). In its present form, modulation frequencies of as much as 20 Hz can be successfully employed without serious attenuation of the current signal, and there is scope for further improvement through the use of smaller nozzles and <b>electrodes</b> and piezoelectric <b>positioners</b> with improved frequency responses...|$|R
40|$|This is a publisherâ€™s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in American Journal of Otology 2000. This version is reproduced with permission of Lippincott Wilkins & Williams. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the insertion properties and intracochlear trajectories of three perimodiolar electrode array designs and to compare these designs with the standard Cochlear /Melbourne array. Background: Advantages to be expected of a perimodiolar electrode array include both a reduction in stimulus thresholds and an increase in dynamic range, resulting in a more localized stimulation pattern of the spiral ganglion cells, reduced power consumption, and, therefore, longer speech processor battery life. Methods: The test arrays were implanted into human temporal bones. Image analysis was performed on a radiograph taken after the insertion. The cochleas were then histologically processed with the electrode array in situ, and the resulting sections were subsequently assessed for position of the electrode array as well as insertion-related intracochlear damage. Results: All perimodiolar electrode arrays were inserted deeper and showed trajectories that were generally closer to the modiolus compared with the standard electrode array. However, although the precurved array designs did not show significant insertion trauma, the method of insertion needed improvement. After insertion of the straight <b>electrode</b> array with <b>positioner,</b> signs of severe insertion trauma in the majority o fimplanted cochleas were found. Conclusions: Although it was possible to position the electrode arrays close to the modiolus, none of the three perimodiolar designs investigated fulfilled satisfactorily all three criteria of being easy, safe, and a traumatic to implant.
