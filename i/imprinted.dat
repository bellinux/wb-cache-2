The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience.

5|$|Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti {{believe that}} king Nynetjer, the third {{ruler of the}} Second dynasty and {{predecessor}} to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, {{in the hope that}} the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the <b>imprinted</b> clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.|$|E
5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, <b>imprinted</b> legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E

All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols <b>imprinted</b> on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989.

40|$|Sexual <b>imprinting</b> is a {{specific}} form of learning, which was originally defined as {{the development of a}} cognitive model of sexual partner based on parental characteristics. This model subsequently influences the mate preferences in adulthood. <b>Imprinting</b> is characterized by difficult modifications of the acquired model and specific sensitivity for this type of learning in fixed period of ontogenesis. However, it remains an open question whether above described definition of <b>imprinting</b> {{can be applied to the}} development of the human mate preferences. Recently, it was pointed out that filial and sexual <b>imprinting</b> should be treated separately. However, many previous studies didn't reflect upon this distinction. Probably, function of filial <b>imprinting</b> is recognition of own species, the sexual <b>imprinting</b> affects preferences on sexual partner.

40|$|The {{biological}} phenomenon, hormonal <b>imprinting,</b> {{was named}} and defined by us (Biol Rev, 1980, 55, 47 - 63) 30  years ago, after many experimental works and observations. Later, similar phenomena were also named to epigenetic <b>imprinting</b> or metabolic <b>imprinting.</b> In {{the case of}} hormonal <b>imprinting,</b> the first encounter between a hormone and its developing target cell receptor—usually at the perinatal period—determines the normal receptor-hormone connection for life. However, in this period, molecules similar to the target hormone (members of the same hormone family, synthetic drugs, environmental pollutants, etc), which are also able to bind to the receptor, provoke faulty <b>imprinting</b> also with lifelong—receptorial, behavioral, etc.,—consequences. Faulty hormonal <b>imprinting</b> could also be provoked later in life in continuously dividing cells and in the brain.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become <b>imprinted</b> and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E

Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (Karyakartha or Rayaswami) and the imperial officers (Adhikari).

40|$|During 1978, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), under {{contract}} with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), initiated research on <b>imprinting</b> salmon and steelhead trout for homing.

5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus <b>imprinted</b> not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was <b>imprinted</b> upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

Here, we critically evaluate previously proposed evolutionary benefits of <b>imprinting</b> and suggest some additional ones. We discuss whether each benefit is capable of explaining both the origin and maintenance of <b>imprinting,</b> and examine how the different benefits interact. We then outline the many costs of <b>imprinting.</b> Simple models show that circulating deleterious recessives can prevent the initial spread of <b>imprinting,</b> even if <b>imprinting</b> would be evolutionarily stable if it could persist long enough to purge these.
