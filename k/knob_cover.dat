5000|$|Iroquois Park is a 739-acre (3.0 km²) {{municipal}} park in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It {{was designed by}} Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Louisville's Cherokee Park and Shawnee Park, at what were then {{the edges of the}} city. Located south of downtown, Iroquois Park was promoted as [...] "Louisville's Yellowstone". It is built on a large <b>knob</b> <b>covered</b> with old growth forest, and its most prominent feature are the scenic viewpoints atop the hill.|$|R

5000|$|Interior doors {{should be}} closed and secured to {{restrict}} a child's {{access to such}} areas as garages, basements, laundry rooms, home offices & gyms, bathrooms, or any other potentially hazardous area. Many different types of door latches are available from simple door <b>knob</b> <b>covers</b> to top-of-door latches that can be operated {{from both sides of}} the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet.|$|R

5000|$|Ventifact Knobs (...) are minor knobs, 3 to 6 m high, {{composed}} of lake clay covered by glacial drift. The glacial drift has cobbles {{that are well}} polished by the wind and cut into ventifacts. The <b>knobs</b> are <b>covered</b> by ventifacts, suggesting the name, and are located just east of Lake Bonney in Taylor Valley, Victoria Land. They were named by U.S. geologist Troy L. Pewe who was first to study and describe the knobs in December 1957.|$|R
5000|$|Hoplomyzon {{species are}} small, {{armoured}} aspredinids, growing up to 32 millimetres (1.3 in) SL in H. sexpapilostoma. [...] Members of this genus are distinguished {{from all other}} aspredinids by having each premaxilla with two bony <b>knobs</b> superficially <b>covered</b> by fleshy papillae, the dorsal and ventral armor plates not overlapping, and 2 - 3 sets of paired pre-anal-fin plates. They also have the maxillary barbels adnate with the head and the pectoral spine less than one-quarter of the fish's standard length.|$|R
50|$|In general, a Fulani hat is a basketry hat made {{of plant}} fibers. It {{is covered in}} leather both at the brim and top and {{sometimes}} with decorative leather elements in the middle. At {{the very top of}} the hat there is a <b>knob</b> which is <b>covered</b> in leather. At the base of the hat there is often a chinstrap with a tassel at the end.|$|R
60|$|Their journey daily {{became more}} toilsome, and their sufferings more severe, as they advanced. Keeping up the channel of a river, they traversed the rugged {{summit of the}} Pilot <b>Knob</b> Mountain, <b>covered</b> with snow nine inches deep. For several days they continued, bending their course as much as {{possible}} to the east, over a succession of rocky heights, deep valleys, and rapid streams. Sometimes their dizzy path lay along the margin of perpendicular precipices, several hundred feet in height, where a single false step might precipitate them into the rocky bed of a torrent which roared below. Not the least part of their weary task was the fording of the numerous windings and branchings of the mountain rivers, all boisterous in their currents, and icy cold.|$|R
60|$|Byblis gigantea (Western Australia).--A dried specimen, about 18 {{inches in}} height, {{with a strong}} stem, was sent me from Kew. The leaves are some inches in length, linear, {{slightly}} flattened, with a small projecting rib on the lower surface. They are covered on all sides by glands of two kinds [page 344] --sessile ones arranged in rows, and others supported on moderately long pedicels. Towards the narrow summits of the leaves the pedicels are longer than elsewhere, and here equal {{the diameter of the}} leaf. The glands are purplish, much flattened, and formed of a single layer of radiating cells, which in the larger glands are from forty to fifty in number. The pedicels consist of single elongated cells, with colourless, extremely delicate walls, marked with the finest intersecting spiral lines. Whether these lines are the result of contraction from the drying of the walls, I do not know, but the whole pedicel was often spirally rolled up. These glandular hairs are far more simple in structure than the so-called tentacles of the preceding genera, and they do not differ essentially from those borne by innumerable other plants. The flower-peduncles bear similar glands. The most singular character about the leaves is that the apex is enlarged into a little <b>knob,</b> <b>covered</b> with glands, and about a third broader than the adjoining part of the attenuated leaf. In two places dead flies adhered to the glands. As no instance is known of unicellular structures having any power of movement,* Byblis, no doubt, catches insects solely by the aid of its viscid secretion. These probably sink down besmeared with the secretion and rest on the small sessile glands, which, if we may judge by the analogy of Drosophyllum, then pour forth their secretion and afterwards absorb the digested matter.|$|R
2500|$|The 2001 {{model was}} largely unchanged; Honda added a digital clock {{to the radio}} display and made the rear wind blocker standard. Honda also added Spa Yellow to the US {{domestic}} market lineup. For the 2002 model year, suspension settings were revised and the plastic rear window {{was replaced by a}} glass unit incorporating an electric defroster. Other updates included slightly revised tail lamps with chrome rings, an upgraded radio with separate tweeters, a leather gearshift <b>knob,</b> leatherette console <b>cover</b> and a revised engine control unit. Honda added Suzuka Blue to the US domestic market lineup.|$|R
50|$|At birth, {{they are}} less than 25 cm and they mature at about 50 cm. Most records are of {{individuals}} less than 1 m, but they can reach about 1.5 m. Their litter size is seven or eight pups off Angola to 23 in the Mediterranean. They have ridges over their eyes that expand into large, rounded <b>knobs,</b> which are <b>covered</b> with enlarged denticles - these are absent in other species of rough sharks. They possess very large spiracles that are vertically elongated, being almost {{as high as the}} length of their eyes. Their first dorsal spine is oriented slightly forward. They feed on worms, crustaceans, and mollusks.|$|R
5000|$|Ritter Royals {{are special}} one-off {{instruments}} made with rare materials and frequently feature uncommon construction designs. For example, {{the body of}} [...] "The Flora Aurum is carved from a rare, solid piece of quilted maple. Its bridge, tuners, and knobs are hand-cast solid gold. Two flawless diamonds, totaling 3.3 carats, adorn the volume and tone <b>knobs.</b> Gold leaf <b>covers</b> {{the back of the}} neck and headstock. It has tiny green-diamond knob position markers and an ebony fingerboard with a Renaissance-inspired solid-gold flower inlay—each leaf decorated with a platinum-set black diamond. The nut was carved from 10,000-year-old Siberian mammoth-tusk ivory. The value of this instrument is estimated at $100,000.00.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1322 was a {{development}} of the earlier Crosman Model 1300 Medalist II in [...]22 caliber, produced from 1970-1976. The Model 1322 was first introduced in 1977, and was produced over its lifetime in three distinct variants: Type I, 1977-81, Type II, made from 1978-1996, and Type III, 1998-2004. Type I featured a sliding metal breech cover, manual cocking using a three-ring external cocking knob, and a steel breech. [...] The Type II adopted a plastic breech {{in place of the}} original steel version. The Type III dropped the external cocking <b>knob</b> and breech <b>cover</b> of prior types in favor of a brass bolt action mechanism that integrated loading and cocking functions.|$|R

5000|$|In August 2014 Vox {{released}} two Night Train limited editions, both {{of which}} were cosmetic updates to the NT2H set and the NT15C1 combo respectively, that recall a more traditional Vox aesthetic. For the Lil' Night Train NT2H-GD-SET, Vox supplied the NT2H head with a matte gold colored tube cage and black control <b>knobs,</b> and then <b>covered</b> its V110NT cab with a retro-traditional “Brown Diamond“ grille cloth and basket weave covering (since there was no [...] "G2" [...] version of the Lil Night Train, this limited edition NT2H seems to mark {{the end of the line}} for this model as Vox makes no further reference to it). For the NT15C1-CL (Classic) combo amp Vox applied a similar treatment with the installation of a gold logo badge and trim on the front of the NT15C1 combo as well as adding the “Brown Diamond“ grille cloth.|$|R
50|$|Porsche {{unveiled}} its 2008 Limited Edition Boxster and Boxster S models at {{a private}} gathering {{down the street from}} the 2007 New York Auto Show. Largely inspired by the 2007 911 GT3 RS, just 250 examples of each model would be produced in brilliant orange and priced at $49,900 (original MSRP $45,800) and $59,900 (original MSRP $55,700) respectively.Clad in the striking RS-special orange paint of the 911 GT3-RS with glossy black painted mirrors, alloy wheels, front and side air inlets, and model designation. The SportDesign package adds visual appeal, and includes aggressive front splitters, a revised rear two-stage spoiler that extends automatically at speed, and an integrated rear diffuser that Porsche says reduces aerodynamic lift. A sports exhaust system with a dual chromed exhaust tip is included, and is claimed to add a few more horsepower. Inside, a numbered 'Limited Edition' plaque is found on the glove box door, while the seat inserts, 911 GT3-spec steering wheel, and handbrake lever all receive Alcantara trim, a suede-like material used on performance Porsches like the 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 RS. Orange roll-over hoops, door lever surrounds, shift <b>knob,</b> cup-holder <b>cover</b> trim and even the font on the gear shift pattern carrying bright orange that match the exterior color and offset the otherwise black interior.Only 250 each, Limited Edition Boxster and ‘S’ models hit showrooms on September 28, 2008. CNBC recently named the Limited Edition as one of its top 15 Most Desirable Porsches.|$|R
5000|$|StreetKa was a Ford inhouse design {{built by}} Pininfarina (the 2000 motor show concept was {{designed}} by Ghia, Turin) in Italy and all StreetKas have sill plates inscribed [...] "Pininfarina". Pininfarina produced 37,076 StreetKas between 2002 and 2005. StreetKa came in two equipment levels, basic and luxury. Basic had cloth seats and air conditioning was an option. Luxury featured leather seats with matching leather door card inserts, heated seats, a Thatcham approved alarm along with Ford's PATS immobiliser, air conditioning and heated door mirrors. Options included upgrading the single CD/radio to an in-dash 6 disc CD/radio and additional rear speakers beneath the roll over bars and a heated windscreen, standard on winter models. All models featured remote control central locking with remote boot release, driver and passenger air bags with passengers air bag deactivation, electric windows and door mirrors, electric headlight aim adjustment, anti-lock brakes, power steering, front fog lights, racing Puma aluminium gear <b>knob,</b> electric hood <b>cover</b> release and a rev counter. The engine used in StreetKa (and SportKa) is called a Duratec but it is of South African origin where it {{is known as the}} Zetec Rocam. StreetKa features McPherson struts front and rear and uses unique wider front lower arms (wishbones) giving it exceptional handling. The only exterior panel shared with Ka is the bonnet. The front headlights are also shared with Ka but appear different due to the front bumper covering them partly to change their shape. The interior shares most parts with Ka except StreetKa has its facia painted blue rather than silver. Its seats are mounted lower than Ka's and it has aluminium effect detailing.|$|R
