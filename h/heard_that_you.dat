5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
2500|$|The script {{contains}} many references to Hollywood and screenwriters, with Joe Gillis making {{most of the}} cynical comments. He sums up his film-writing career with the remark: [...] "The last one I wrote was about Okies in the dust bowl. You'd never know, because when it reached the screen, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat." [...] In another exchange, Betty comments to Gillis: [...] "I'd always <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had some talent." [...] He replies: [...] "That was last year. This year I'm {{trying to make a}} living." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Persian slave Piruz Nahavandi (also {{known as}} Abu Lulu) brought a {{complaint}} to Umar {{about the high}} tax charged by his master Mughirah. Umar wrote to Mughirah and inquired about the tax; Mughirah's reply was satisfactory, but Umar held that the tax charged to Abu Lulu was reasonable, owing to his daily income. Umar then {{is reported to have}} asked Abu Lulu: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> make windmills; make one for me as well." [...] In a sullen mood, Piruz said, [...] "Verily I will make such a mill for you, that the whole world would remember it".|$|E

2500|$|Directed by Ben Coughlan, Del Rey filmed {{a second}} video for the song, titled [...] "Video Games (Live At The Premises)". Uploaded to her {{official}} VEVO account on October 18, 2011, the song features Del Rey in jean {{shorts and a}} white T-shirt, singing into a microphone barefoot, while accompanied by a pianist. The Huffington Post wrote that the video was [...] "loaded", indicating that the title was a contradiction and not, in fact, a live performance whatsoever. Additionally, they wrote: [...] "we understand the takedowns of her hype (there {{is a lot of}} hype), but that doesn't change the fact that [...] "Video Games"—the tune Lana's singing live this time—is one helluva song." [...] Aside from criticizing her pillowy lips and long fingernails, The Guardian applauded Del Rey for amping up on the coquettish glances and hushed vocals as she devastatingly delivers the line, [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> like the bad girls, honey, is that true?" ...|$|E

The letter may never reach you, for I {{do not know how to}} address it, tho’ I feel sure your name upon the envelope will be sufficient. It is nearly two years ago, that my dear eldest son went out to the War for the last time and the day he said goodbye to me ~ we were looking together across the sun-glorified sea ~ looking towards France, with breaking hearts ~ when he, my poet son, said those wonderful words of yours ~ beginning at ‘When I go from hence, let this be my parting word’ ~ and when his pocket book came back to me ~ I found these words written in his dear writing ~ with your name beneath." ...|$|E
2500|$|On [...] October 16, 2006, {{the tone}} of the {{messages}} changed. After Megan got home from school, Tina Meier signed onto MySpace for Megan. She was in a hurry because she had to take her younger daughter, Allison, to the orthodontist. Before she could get to the door, Megan was upset. [...] "Josh" [...] sent troubling messages to Megan, including one that said: [...] "I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not very nice to your friends." [...] More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to ask her if she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, [...] "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!" [...] and then left from the computer and went upstairs. According to her father Ron Meier and a neighbor who had discussed the hoax with Drew, the last message sent by [...] "Josh" [...] read: [...] "Everybody in O'Fallon knows who you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you".|$|E

2500|$|Pu Sheng {{was born}} to Pu Jiàn in 335, as his third son, by his wife, the later Empress Qiang. [...] At that time, both Pu Jiàn and his father Pu Hong (蒲洪) were generals for Later Zhao. [...] Pu Sheng was born blind in one eye (though some {{accounts}} said that he lost his eye to an eagle while trying to get eagle eggs). [...] Once, his grandfather Pu Hong teased him, [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> my blind boy, only shed tears from one eye; is that true?" [...] Pu Sheng, in anger, stabbed his blind eye and exclaimed, [...] "This is the other eye shedding tear!" [...] Pu Hong, shocked at his reaction, whipped him and told him, [...] "You are only deserving to be a slave!" [...] He responded, [...] "That is fine; I'll just be like Shi Le(a slave who became an emperor)." [...] Pu Hong became concerned at his behavior, which was also manifested by lack of discipline, and told Pu Jiàn that he should consider killing his son, lest that his family be destroyed by him. [...] Pu Jiàn considered it, but was dissuaded from it by his brother Pu Xiong (蒲雄). [...] As Pu Sheng grew, he became known for his strength and ferocity in battle, as he {{was strong enough to}} battle wild beasts, and was skillful in horsemanship and use of weapons. [...] After his father (who had by then changed the family name from Pu to Fu) established Former Qin in 351, he was created the Prince of Huainan.|$|E
