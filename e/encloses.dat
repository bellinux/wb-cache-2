One solution circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa. For example, in Figure6, one solution circle (pink, upper left) <b>encloses</b> two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate solution (also pink, lower right) <b>encloses</b> that third given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate solution circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E

They have a two part carapace which <b>encloses</b> the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malcostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the intertidal zone to the deep ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed).|$|E
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which <b>encloses</b> {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely <b>encloses</b> the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E

The dike was complete in 1961. A ceremony held in Clewiston on January 12, 1961, included a speech from former President Herbert Hoover. Since its completion, the dike almost completely <b>encloses</b> the lake. The only gap is at Fisheating Creek – the mouth located in Glades County near Lakeport – where the dike turns inland and parallels the stream on both sides for several miles, leaving Fisheating Creek as the only remaining free-flowing tributary of Lake Okeechobee.|$|E
5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that <b>encloses</b> the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
