In 1914 there was an administrative change <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> federal money considered better spent in the Midwest than on schools like Carlisle. Many students left, and this affected the team (which had a 5–10–1 record). After that season, Warner left Carlisle to become head coach at Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E

25|$|After Anthony {{retired as}} {{president}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Carrie Chapman Catt, her chosen successor, began working toward an international women's suffrage association, one of Anthony's long-time goals. The existing International Council of Women could not be expected to support a campaign for women's suffrage because it was a broad alliance whose more conservative members would object. In 1902, Catt organized a preparatory meeting <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> Anthony as chair, that was attended by delegates from several countries. Organized primarily by Catt, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was created in Berlin in 1904. The founding meeting was chaired by Anthony, who was declared to be the new organization's honorary president and first member.|$|E

During the six remaining years of her life, Anthony spoke at six more NAWSA conventions and four congressional hearings, completed the fourth volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and traveled to eighteen states and to Europe. As Anthony's fame grew, some politicians (certainly not all of them) were happy to be publicly associated with her. Her seventieth birthday was celebrated at a national event <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> prominent members of the House and Senate in attendance.

25|$|In Washington State, {{the first}} plantings of Cabernet Franc were {{cultivated}} in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, Cabernet Franc was {{planted in the}} Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first Cabernet Franc rosé. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> the wines tending to show more notes of ground coffee and olives.|$|E
