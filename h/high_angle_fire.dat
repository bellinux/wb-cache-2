2500|$|Although {{the design}} was {{rejected}} for the fleet cruiser role, by August 1935, after {{no less than}} eight design proposals, it had evolved to present a destroyer with eight 4.7inch Quick Firing Mark XII guns, in four twin mountings, with a maximum elevation of 40°, controlled by a low-angle (LA) director and high-angle / low-angle (HA/LA) rangefinder director on the bridge. To provide close range anti-aircraft protection, the design was fitted with a quadruple Mark VII QF 2 pdr [...] "pom pom" [...] mounting, and two quadruple Vickers [...]50-inch machine guns. These ships introduced the Fuze Keeping Clock <b>High</b> <b>Angle</b> <b>Fire</b> Control Computer, which was used on all subsequent British wartime destroyers. The ships were also armed with a quadruple bank of torpedo tubes. They {{were considered to be}} handsome ships, with a clipper bow that provided excellent seakeeping and two raked funnels and masts. They are remembered with great affection to this day.|$|E
2500|$|For fire control, {{the class}} used the Fuze Keeping Clock <b>High</b> <b>Angle</b> <b>Fire</b> Control Computer. The [...] "Cr" [...] group was fitted {{with the new}} Mk VI HA/LA Director while remote power control (RPC) gunlaying {{equipment}} was fitted. The additional weight of the new fire control equipment and the powered mountings for the 4.5 inch guns meant that only one quadruple torpedo mount was fitted, and the depth charge armament was reduced to 35 depth charges. [...] Most of the ships were fitted with a single Hazemayer Bofors mount, {{although some of the}} later ships instead had the lighter and simpler Mk V twin Bofors mount. They also introduced the all-welded hull into Royal Navy destroyer construction, with the [...] "Cr" [...] flotilla all being of all-welded construction. Late delivery of the Mk VI directors delayed completion such that none of the [...] "Cr"s entered service {{before the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E

50|$|Early in World War I, the Norwegian Army {{realised}} that aircraft were {{a threat}} {{that needed to be}} countered. At first, attempts were made to mount existing field guns on new mounts to allow <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire,</b> but it was soon obvious that a more specialised weapon was needed. Attempts were made to buy British and French guns, but both nations needed the weapons themselves because of the ongoing war.|$|E
50|$|It {{used one}} man laying and had Probert pattern {{calibrating}} sights. The Dial Sight was initially the No 7 but was gradually {{replaced by the}} No 9. In the 1960s sights were converted from degrees, minutes and yards to mils and metres. There was no anti-tank telescope. Late in the war a sight adapter was introduced to permit upper register (<b>high</b> <b>angle)</b> <b>fire</b> when the wheels were raised significantly above {{the level of the}} spades.|$|E
5000|$|The 105 mm Fd Mk 2 {{ammunition}} has two propelling cartridges and a {{blank cartridge}} (for saluting purposes). The normal cartridge has six propellant increments (charges one, two, three and four) plus 4½ and 5 increments. Charge 4½, which is charge five {{with the blue}} charge three bag removed, is only used for <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire.</b> It is peculiar to the light gun. A separate [...] "charge super" [...] cartridge is used for firing to maximum range.|$|E

50|$|The guns fired a {{relatively}} lightweight shell; necessarily the guns had a low muzzle velocity, requiring a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>fire</b> even at short ranges. This increased the flight {{time of the}} shell, resulting {{in a loss of}} accuracy.|$|R

50|$|Bellona was a {{modified}} Dido-class design with only four turrets but improved anti-aircraft (AA) armament. She {{was built by}} Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (Govan, Scotland), with the keel being laid down on 30 November 1939. She was launched on 29 September 1942 and commissioned on 29 October 1943. All of the Bellona class used the HACS <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> control system {{and they were all}} fitted with Remote Power Control, allowing the HACS to remotely control their 5.25 in guns.|$|E
5000|$|Rockets were {{introduced}} to western warfare during the Napoleonic Wars; the Congreve rocket was a British weapon devised by Sir William Congreve in 1804 after experiencing Indian rockets at the Siege of Seringapatam (1799). Congreve rockets were launched from an iron trough about 18 inches (45 centimetres) in length, called a [...] "chamber". These chambers could be fixed to the ground for horizontal launching, secured to a folding copper tripod for <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> or mounted on frames on carts or the decks of warships.|$|E
50|$|Cymbeline could {{locate a}} mortar with an {{accuracy}} of 50 metres. 81 mm mortars could be located {{at up to}} 10 km and larger mortars to 20 km. Secondary roles were area and coastal surveillance, helicopter and light aircraft control, meteor balloon tracking and rapid survey. It could also observe and adjust ground and airburst artillery fire and <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire.</b> In British service each radar held a spare main electronic unit, spare generator and spare displays. The radar includes an integral simulator for operator training and practice and built-in test functionality.|$|E
5000|$|After {{experience}} in the First World War, the Type 38 was upgraded to the [...] "C" [...] version, with a lengthened bore and modified carriage to permit a <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>fire.</b> This modified version was already obsolete {{by the start of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War, but continued to be used by reserve and second-line forces through the end of World War II.|$|R
50|$|The Stokes mortar was a British trench mortar {{invented by}} Sir Wilfred Stokes KBE that was issued to the British, Empire and U.S. armies, {{as well as}} the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (CEP), during the later half of the First World War. The 3-inch trench mortar is a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading weapon for <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of <b>fire.</b> Although it is called a 3-inch mortar, its bore is {{actually}} 3.2 inches or 81 mm.|$|R
50|$|The M-46 was {{developed}} from the M-36 130 mm naval gun used on ships and for coast defence. It is a true gun, being unable to fire much above 45° and having a long barrel and a single propelling charge. In contrast, most Western field guns of this period had a dual <b>high</b> and low <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> capability, a gun-howitzer.|$|R
50|$|Modern mortars use a shell {{with the}} {{propelling}} charge and primer attached at the base. Unlike older muzzleloading mortars, which were loaded {{the same way}} as muzzleloading cannon, the modern mortar is fired by dropping the shell down the barrel where a pin fires the primer, igniting the main propelling charge. Both the modern mortar and the older mortar were used for <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire.</b> However, the fact that the mortar is not loaded in separate steps may make its definition as a muzzleloader a matter of opinion.|$|E
50|$|Both charge {{five and}} charge super project beyond {{the end of}} the metal {{cartridge}} case. Unlike the M1 ammunition, which is 'semi fixed' and loaded as a complete round, 105 mm Fd is 'separate'; the shell is loaded and rammed by hand, then the cartridge is loaded. By the time the L118 entered service, propellant sub-zones A and B originally used with the Abbot had been replaced by an aerodynamic spoiler (a ring slipped over the nose of shell to lodge on the ogive) to reduce the minimum range at <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> when this was required.|$|E
50|$|The Bellona {{subclass}} {{differed in}} appearance somewhat from their predecessors. They had eight 5.25 inch (133 mm) RP10MkII guns in four twin turrets and had greatly improved anti-aircraft armament, with twelve 2 pounder guns and twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. The {{bridge of the}} Bellona class was lowered by one deck compared to the previous three groups, which allowed full radar control to be fitted to the 5.25 inch (133 mm) turrets and 2 pounders, due to the decreased topweight. These ships used the HACS <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire</b> control system. The two funnels were more upright than the raked ones of the original Dido class.|$|E
50|$|Infantry guns drew much {{interest}} in course of World War I because of the developments in trench warfare. In addition to the usual requirements {{that they needed to}} be portable enough to be carried by infantry, two separate capabilities were desired. First, it needed to engage in <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> indirect <b>fire,</b> especially given the prevalence of trenches. Second, it needed to be capable of low <b>angle</b> direct <b>fire,</b> while being carried by assault infantry, to engage strongpoints, bunkers, and other fortifications. Some infantry guns that appeared between world wars, such as the German 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18 and Japanese Type 92 battalion gun, were designed to meet all these requirements simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} advance {{can be seen}} in the Birch gun {{developed}} by the British for their motorised warfare experimental brigade (the Experimental Mechanized Force) after the end of the War. This mounted a field gun, capable of both the usual artillery trajectories and <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> anti-aircraft <b>fire,</b> on a tank style chassis. It was designed and built as part of a general approach to warfare where all arms, infantry and artillery included, would be able to operate over the same terrain as tanks. The Red Army also experimented with truck- and tank-mounted artillery, but produced none in quantity.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 18th century, a number of European armies began to {{introduce}} howitzers that were mobile enough to accompany armies in the field. Though usually fired at the relatively <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of <b>fire</b> used by contemporary siege howitzers, these field howitzers were rarely defined by this capability. Rather, as the field guns of the day were usually restricted to inert projectiles (which relied entirely on momentum for their destructive effects), the field howitzers of the 18th century were chiefly valued for their ability to fire explosive shells. Many, for the sake of simplicity and rapidity of fire, dispensed with adjustable propellant charges.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{there were}} three cartridges. Sub-zones 1 and 2 were only used to provide short range in <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire,</b> and were soon {{replaced}} by a plastic spoiler slipped over the shell ogive. Normal cartridge gave charges 1-5, each bag being a different colour in accordance with established UK practice, Mk 1 normal cartridge only went to charge 4. Both marks had charge Super, a single charge cartridge, although the charge was reduced in Mk 1. Charges 5 and Super used extended [...] "bags" [...] that projected beyond the metal cartridge case. The 105 mm Fd uses double (often internationally called triple) base propellants designated N in UK service instead of the single based FNH propellants favoured by the US. The 105 mm Fd Mk 2 is still used with L118 Light Gun.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{separate}} shell and cartridge allowed the charge {{to be changed}} for different ranges. For the Mk 1 Ordnance on an 18-pounder carriage there were three [...] "charges", charges one, two and three, all {{of which could be}} used in the common cartridge design. The Mk 2 Ordnance on Mk 1 carriage added a [...] "super" [...] charge in a different cartridge. In 1943 a separately bagged [...] "increment" [...] charge was added; used with the Super it provided higher velocity for anti-tank use. The introduction of the increment to super was only possible following the addition of the muzzle-brake in the previous year. Subsequently another type of increment was introduced to be added to charges one and two to provide additional combinations for use in <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fire.</b> However, this fire required a dial sight adaptor, removal of the platform and some excavation of the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the design}} was {{rejected}} for the fleet cruiser role, by August 1935, after {{no less than}} eight design proposals, it had evolved to present a destroyer with eight 4.7 inch Quick Firing Mark XII guns, in four twin mountings, with a maximum elevation of 40°, controlled by a low-angle (LA) director and high-angle / low-angle (HA/LA) rangefinder director on the bridge. To provide close range anti-aircraft protection, the design was fitted with a quadruple Mark VII QF 2 pdr [...] "pom pom" [...] mounting, and two quadruple Vickers [...]50-inch machine guns.

They are remembered with great affection to this day.|$|E
25|$|The new turret seats the gunner on {{the left}} hand side of the main gun. On top of the turret there's one single piece {{circular}} hatch opening to the front. Located {{in front of the}} said hatch is the gunner's sight which is the same one as the one used in BMP-2. Another gunner's sight is located {{on the left}} hand side of the main gun and moves in vertical planes along with it. It is a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>fire</b> sight used when the gunner is aiming at air targets. The vehicle also has additional periscopes that provide it with vision on the sides. A white searchlight is mounted in front of the turret.|$|R
50|$|The Soviets {{modified}} the truncated cone turret {{used on the}} BTR-70 for the BTR-80 by redesigning the mantlet. This allows the 14.5 mm KPVT and coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine guns to be elevated {{to a maximum of}} 60 degrees. This <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>fire</b> is useful in engaging targets on steep slopes, in urban fighting, and for engaging low slow flying air targets. The Soviets have also {{modified the}} design and positioning of the firing ports; the ports are now round, rather than tear-shaped, and have ball mounts similar to those used on the BMP-1. The forward firing ports now sit in angled recesses, which allows infantry to fire {{from the front of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|As {{was normal}} {{for the period}} the gun has a shield, {{including}} a folding piece below the cradle support. The centre section of the upper shield both slides {{up and down and}} folds to accommodate the barrel at <b>higher</b> elevation <b>angles</b> of <b>fire.</b> The shield may offer some protection against muzzle blast to the sights and layer, although it is usually shown being fired with a long lanyard, but is probably mostly for defence against machine gun fire.|$|R
