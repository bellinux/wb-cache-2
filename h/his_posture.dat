When Johnnie finds Lumpy absent in the morning, he suspects that she has abandoned him. Much to his relief, he finds her waiting for breakfast in his kitchen. When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle. Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief is}} in a {{dilapidated}} condition {{with most of}} the arms and legs broken.

25|$|Between the 6th and 9th centuries, the {{iconography}} of the Resurrection in the Eastern Church was influenced by {{the iconography}} of the Transfiguration, given that there was no scriptural guidance for the depiction of the Resurrection scene. In traditional Orthodox iconography the actual moment of the Resurrection of Christ ("Anabasis") is never depicted, unlike the treatment of the raising of Lazarus. The icons do not depict the moment of the Resurrection, but show the Myrrhbearers, or the Harrowing of Hell. Usually the resurrected Christ is rescuing Adam and Eve, and often other figures, symbolizing the salvation of humanity. <b>His</b> <b>posture</b> is often very active, paralleling the Western depictions that show him climbing out of the tomb.|$|E

In April 2014 the IPCC passed files to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider whether criminal charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice should be brought against two of the officers, Sgt Paul White and PC Mark Harratt. White had given evidence at the inquest that he had checked on Rigg and carried out a risk assessment while he was detained in the police van, including <b>his</b> <b>posture</b> and his general demeanour, but CCTV evidence proved he had not visited the van at any time. Harratt had corroborated White's version of events. The third officer was cleared by the IPCC.|$|E

[...] Then living in Daytona Beach, Florida, he was later hurt in an automobile accident, which aggravated a lower-back injury.

[...] By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and <b>his</b> <b>posture</b> was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.|$|E
500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled <b>his</b> <b>posture</b> and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, {{while being}} interviewed about an {{anthology}} of the independence movement on radio Juan Mari Brás made a public request to Ojeda Ríos to detail the EPB's ideology for that project. The requested information was received shortly afterwards and published in Claridad. The article begins by quoting Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth [...] "the colonized are cured of colonial neurosis by driving the colonist out by force", citing the ambient of the populace after the destruction of airplanes in Muñiz airbase {{as an example of}} this, remembering a general feeling of [...] "pride and hope" [...] in the populace. Ojeda Ríos then establishes a dichotomy between the reactionary violence of colonialism and revolutionary actions, saying that the first was imposed on Puerto Ricans and created divisions that could potentially lead to a Civil War. He then discussed that the EPB believes that the right for self-determination and independence established in Resolution 1514 (XV) grants [...] "moral and legal strength" [...] to their actions. Ojeda Ríos further cites the provisions of Resolution 2105 (XX) inviting UN members to cooperate with armed resistance in colonies, the assessment provided in Resolution 2326 that repression of armed movements is [...] "incompatible with the parameters of Resolution 1514" [...] and Resolution 2621 (XXV) that declares ongoing colonialism a crime [...] "against the principles of international law" [...] as supporting his stance. He concludes by stating that the violence employed by the EPB [...] "is not aggressive, but defensive". Ojeda Ríos also quoted Fanon's assertion that the [...] "colonist makes history", noting the existence of two coexisting and conflicting accounts of Puerto Rican history and establishing a parallel with the revolutionary history in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular by mentioning the involvement of Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María Mercedes in Simon Bolivar's campaign. He cites the 1811 San Germán conspiracy, an independentist uprising planned by members of the Regimiento de Granada Andrés Salvador and Juan Vizcarrondo Ortiz de Zárate in 1838 and the actions of bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi and politician Ramón Power y Giralt as events that build the Cry of Lares and as part of an [...] "ignored history". Ojeda also established a contrast between Betances and Luis Muñoz Rivera, calling the latter an [...] "opportunist" [...] that promoted a reform of the Spanish colonial system, calling Albizu the spiritual successor of the former for his criticism of autonomists that pursue an expansion of faculties under the territorial clause. He calls Corretjer the next link in the chain and laments that the initiatives of independentists that were part of the Muñoz Marín administration were attributed to the governor [...] "for the benefit of the North American government". Ojeda Ríos reiterated <b>his</b> <b>posture</b> against participating in general elections and rebutted an argument recently published where countries like Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and Chile were essentially neocolonies, citing that they merely responded to their historical realities and were still capable to employ these alliances according to their own interests despite the influence of the United States. Ojeda Ríos concluded noting that EPB members held civilian jobs and acted covertly, resulting in the presence of Macheteros in any place and any government agency, noting that at the moment their strategy was not one of frontal assault but of armed propaganda, through which actions were focused on targets that could gather the attention and support of the public. He insisted that this was resulting in a covert support that would allow a progression towards other strategies, while avoiding actions against them. Ojeda Ríos closed this letter by contrasting the actions of the EPB to terrorist tactics, citing the ongoing war in the Middle East, the Holocaust and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as examples of an unacceptable terrorism that had [...] "no space" [...] within the organization's philosophy. One that he described as based on the principles of [...] "equality" [...] and [...] "social justice".|$|E

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is a life-size, cast bronze {{figure of}} a man {{on his hands and}} knees. [...] The man’s head is bent toward the ground, and <b>his</b> <b>posture</b> is tensed as if he is trying not to collapse further. [...] Both hands and both feet are in contact with the horizontal bronze base, which is approximately two inches thick; his proper left knee is also connected to this base. [...] His proper right leg is in a position of moving slightly forward. [...] The surface of the bronze is highly textured and carries a brown patina, with the texture allowing some areas of brighter bronze to show through.|$|E

[...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in the front seat and my sister, Barbara, and I in the back.

2500|$|X-ray imaging of the Bathers has {{revealed}} that some components of the composition were altered as Seurat’s work on the canvas progressed, while other components were probably not in the painting at all, as he first painted it. The two reclining figures—one {{at the front of}} the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the X-ray image to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the X-ray image at all, showing he is a late addition. <b>His</b> <b>posture</b> reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front. The skiff and the ferry boat with the tricolor, and the pointillistically applied spots at various locations in the lower mid-section of the painting, are also absent in the X-ray image. A contentious theory suggests that these elements were added by Seurat as a means of making a connection between the Bathers and A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. In spite of their remoteness in the middle distance, the motifs and the seated figures on the boat are present in the later painting, and the ferry boat indeed traverses the river between the Courbevoie river-bank and the île de la Grande Jatte itself. The late additions in Bathers bring for the first time a note of vitality to the serene picture in keeping with the more [...] "sociable" [...] climate of A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.|$|E
