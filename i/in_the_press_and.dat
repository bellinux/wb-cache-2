5|$|Sadat {{also played}} his role the {{deception}} plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in Algeria, and {{upon his return}} was rumored to be ill.

5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> {{led to the formation}} in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all be incorporated into the new complex.|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> <b>and</b> public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was slowed by Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it was reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> <b>and</b> art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> <b>and</b> it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E

5|$|Ravalomanana's {{announcement}} sparked retaliatory {{actions by}} the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in unpaid back taxes, and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, Tiako iMadagasikara (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in {{urban and rural areas}} across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko. Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters, baseball caps, tee-shirts and other promotional materials.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{coached the}} Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before {{becoming}} {{the head coach}} of Seattle Sounders FC in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history and was {{the recipient of the}} MLS Coach of the Year Award in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Berrios {{combined}} {{government sector}} jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, {{and private sector}} proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales.

5|$|By mid-July, Gilligan {{had been}} named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia {{at the end of}} the English cricket season, and was {{expected}} to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. Two players in the England team during the South Africa series spoke out against his tactics: Cec Parkin published a highly critical article <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> never played for England again; George Macaulay clashed with Gilligan on the field during one Test. The consequent absence of both men from the tour substantially weakened the bowling strength of the team. Although Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press believed Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach. Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had first asked Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Following the British {{declaration}} of war with Germany on 4 August 1914, Speyer resigned as a partner of the Frankfurt branch of the bank. After a Royal Proclamation on 11 September 1914 requiring British subjects to have no links with companies doing business with Germany, Speyer resigned as a partner of the American bank. Nonetheless, suspicions regarding Speyer's German parentage led to a hate campaign against him. Crowds gathered outside his home and jeered visitors. Accusations of his disloyalty and treachery appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Press,</b> <b>and</b> {{he was accused of}} signalling to German submarines from his Norfolk house. Lady Speyer was ostracised from societies and associations of which she had formerly been a member. Speyer was asked to resign from the board of the Poplar Hospital due to threats of substantial reductions in donations if he remained. The couple was asked to remove their children from school as other parents were threatening to remove theirs.|$|E
