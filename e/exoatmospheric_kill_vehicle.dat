50|$|The United States {{missile defense}} complex in Poland, {{also called the}} European Interceptor Site (EIS), was a planned American missile defense base. It was {{intended}} to contain 10 silo-based interceptors: two-stage versions of the existing three-stage Ground Based Interceptors with <b>Exoatmospheric</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>Vehicles</b> that had a closing speed of about 7 km/s. The first planned complex was to be located near Redzikowo, Poland, forming a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system {{in conjunction with a}} U.S. narrow-beam midcourse tracking and discrimination radar system located in Brdy, Czech Republic. EIS was cancelled in 2009 and subsequently replaced with a phased plan - the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which will include SM-3 Block IIA interceptors to be positioned in Poland from 2018.|$|R
50|$|While flying {{below the}} {{operational}} envelope of <b>Exoatmospheric</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> the tradeoff with HGVs {{in comparison to}} conventional MIRVs are many-fold, including no {{needle in a haystack}} protection from missile decoys and both less speed and altitude as they near the target, all of these characteristics result in HGVs having poorer survivability odds when placed against lower-tier interceptors. Some examples of which include the high thrust mach-10 Sprint missile, its US derivatives and the still operational mach-17 Russian 53T6, ABM-3 Gazelle. Moreover the possible re-emergence of nuclear or hit-to-kill stratosphere reaching guns, guided and triggered by forward operating flight-path sensors. Such as the 2016 Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) in development for the M109 howitzer also will decrease HGV survivability odds.|$|R

Boeing and TRW reported that the June 1997 flight test achieved its primary objectives but detected some sensor abnormalities. The project office relied on Boeing to oversee the performance of TRW. Boeing and TRW reported that deployed target objects displayed distinguishable features when being observed by an infrared sensor. After considerable debate, the program manager {{reduced the number of}} decoys planned for intercept flight tests in response to a recommendation by an independent panel. The Phase One Engineering Team, which was responsible for completing an assessment of TRW's software performance within two months using available data, found that although the software had weaknesses, it was well designed and worked properly, with only some changes needed to increase the robustness of the discrimination function. On the basis of that analysis, team members predicted that the software would perform successfully in a future intercept test if target objects deployed as expected. ...|$|R

40|$|Boost-phase {{intercept}} of {{a threat}} intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is the first layer of a multilayer defense. This thesis investigates the requirements and limitations of the U.

The prediction of the ICBM trajectory takes {{the rotation of the}} earth and the atmospheric drag into account along with the gravitational forces and thrust. The threat ICBM locations, specifications and capabilities of the EKV and EKV carrier, and the capabilities of the space launch vehicle are analyzed to determine an appropriate orbit for the space-based intercept. The pursuit guidance, proportional navigation guidance and bang-bang guidance rules and their performances are investigated and simulated for three example ICBM threats in three-dimensional environment. The simulation results performances are compared and analyzed for minimum miss distance, intercept time and total command effort. The guidance rules are combined to meet the mission requirements, resulting in a hybrid guidance algorithm, which uses different guidance rules for different stages of a boost-phase intercept scenario...|$|R
50|$|Israel Aerospace Industries {{announced}} in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented exoatmospheric interception method includes a two-stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology. Unlike most <b>kill</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which use liquid or gas propulsion, the new Israeli <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> will be propelled by an ordinary rocket motor {{equipped with a}} thrust-vectoring nozzle. It will also be fitted with a gimbaled seeker for hemispheric coverage. By measuring the seeker's line-of-sight propagation relative to the <b>vehicle's</b> motion, the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> will use proportional navigation to divert its course and line up exactly with the target's flight path. Joseph Hasson, chief missile designer at IAI, who patented the new <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> with his colleague Galya Goldner, says that the concept is relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive, {{and is based on}} mature technologies. Furthermore, the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle's</b> divert capability and agility reduce the need for detection and tracking systems, which usually accompany remote sensor-assisted <b>exoatmospheric</b> <b>kills.</b> IAI displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 missile and its <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedBoost phase interception of ballistic missiles is envisioned {{as the primary}} response of the layered defense architecture implemented in the ballistic missile defense system. A limited time frame in which to take action and the necessity to implement hit-to-kill technology in the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> counterbalances the many advantages of boost phase interception. Direct hit missile technology is constrained by the requirement to minimize miss distance to a negligible amount between the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> and optimum aimpoint on the target. This thesis examines <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> effectiveness, which is tantamount to miss distance, {{as a function of}} both the <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> maximum acceleration capability and the guidance system time constant necessary to destroy a target. The <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> guidance system is modeled in MATLAB as a fifth-order binomial series with proportional navigation. The simulation examines the effect of an accelerating target attributed to powered flight and aimpoint displacement caused by a shift in tracking point from the target plume to the payload when resolution occurs. The <b>kill</b> <b>vehicle</b> minimum requirements as indi-cated by the simulation include a lateral acceleration capability of four times the target acceleration and a guidance system time constant that is less than one-tenth the estimated flight time.

In the arms control arena, theater ballistic missile threats have been defined to include systems with reentry velocities up to five kilometers per second and strategic ballistic missile threats have reentry velocities that exceed five kilometers per second. The development and testing of TMD systems such as the Army Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) Lower Tier, and NMD systems such as the Army <b>Exoatmospheric</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and the Army Ground-Based Radar, pose exceptional challenges that stem from extreme acquisition range and high telemetry data transfer rates. Potential Central Pacific range locations include U. S. Army Kwajalien Atoll/Kwajalein Missile Range (USAKA/KMR) and the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) with target launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Wake Island, Aur Atoll, Johnston Island, and, possibly, an airborne platform. Safety considerations for remote target launches dictate utilization of high-data-rate, on-board instrumentation; technical performance measurement dictates transmission of focal plane array data; and operational requirements dictate intercepts at exoatmospheric altitudes and long slant ranges. The high gain, high data rate, telemetry acquisition requirements, coupled with loss of the upper S-band spectrum, may require innovative approaches to minimize electronic noise, maximize telemetry system gain, and fully utilize the limited S-band telemetry spectrum.
