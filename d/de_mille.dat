5|$|Her next {{role was}} not as helpful to her career. She {{appeared}} in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, {{which turned out to}} be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes <b>de</b> <b>Mille,</b> who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes <b>de</b> <b>Mille,</b> since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E

25|$|Hollywood {{has been}} hitting two {{extremes}} – either a Biblical <b>de</b> <b>Mille</b> spectacular or a Baby Doll.

25|$|A CD release, {{containing}} 18 studio-recorded songs sung by {{the original}} cast, appeared in 2002. Most songs were present in their full versions as heard in the show. Some songs were not featured, partly because they were variations on others already present (for example, Rien dans les manches being a pared-down version of Mille millions <b>de</b> <b>mille</b> sabords). A notable omission was Promenade avec Tournesol, a cheerful tune that would have appeared between tracks 9 and 10 on the CD.|$|E
25|$|Like most Shakespearean filmmakers, Cukor and his screenwriter Talbot Jennings cut {{much of the}} {{original}} script: playing around 45% of it. Many of these cuts are common ones in the theatre, such as the second appearance of the chorus and the comic scene of Peter with the musicians. Others are filmic: designed to replace words with action, or rearranging scenes in order to introduce groups of characters in longer narrative sequences. However, Jennings retains more of Shakespeare's poetry for the young lovers {{than any of his}} big-screen successors. Several scenes are interpolated, including three sequences featuring Friar John in Mantua. In contrast, the role of Friar Laurence (an important character in the play) is much reduced. A number of scenes are expanded as opportunities for visual spectacle, including the opening brawl (set against the backdrop of a religious procession), the wedding and Juliet's funeral. The party scene, choreographed by Agnes <b>de</b> <b>Mille,</b> includes Rosaline (an unseen character in Shakespeare's script) who rebuffs Romeo. The role of Peter is enlarged, and played by Andy Devine as a faint-hearted bully. He speaks lines which Shakespeare gave to other Capulet servants, making him the instigator of the opening brawl.|$|E

According to Agnes de Mille's biographer, her uncle always deferred to the [...] "reliable but pedestrian" [...] Prinz, even after agreeing to his niece's flamboyant dances in advance.

500|$|In 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} {{roles in the}} dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes <b>de</b> <b>Mille,</b> who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By {{the time of the}} Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!, [...] <b>de</b> <b>Mille</b> a she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the [...] "Many a New Day" [...] dance number. She became known as [...] "The Girl Who Fell Down". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or <b>de</b> <b>Mille.</b> McCracken has said the ideas was hers, while <b>de</b> <b>Mille</b> and others recall it as being the choreographer's.
