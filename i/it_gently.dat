[...] H. H. Arnason noted that Whaam! presents [...] "limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing," [...] which produce [...] "a hard-edge subject painting that documents while <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> parodies the familiar hero images of modern America." [...] The flat and highly finished style of planned brushstrokes can be seen as pop art's reaction against the looseness of abstract expressionism. Alastair Sooke says that the work can be interpreted as a symbolic self-portrait in which the pilot in the left panel represents Lichtenstein [...] "vanquishing his competitors in a dramatic art-world dogfight" [...] by firing a missile at the colorful [...] "parody of abstract painting" [...] in the right panel.|$|E

500|$|Nikisch {{was invited}} to tour North America in 1912, and despite his long {{association}} with the Berlin Philharmonic and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, he insisted that the LSO should be contracted for the tour. The orchestra, 100-strong (all men except for the harpist), was booked to sail on the Titanic, but the tour schedule was changed at the last minute, and the players sailed safely on the Baltic. The tour was arduous, but a triumph. The New York Press said, [...] "The great British band played with a vigor, force and temperamental impetuousness that almost lifted the listener out of his seat." [...] The New York Times praised all departments of the orchestra, though, like The Manchester Guardian, it found the strings [...] "brilliant rather than mellow". The paper had a little fun at the LSO's expense: {{from the viewpoint of}} a country that had long enjoyed permanent, salaried orchestras such as the Boston Symphony, <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> mocked the LSO's [...] "bold stand for the sacred right of sending substitutes" ...|$|E
500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E
2500|$|Fish can not groom themselves. Some fish specialise as cleaner fish, and {{establish}} cleaning stations where other fish {{can come to}} have their parasites nibbled away. The [...] "resident fish doctor and dentist on the reef is the bluestreak cleaner wrasse". The bluestreak is marked with a conspicuous bright blue stripe and behaves in a stereotypical way which attracts larger fish to its cleaning station. As the bluestreak snacks on the parasites <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> tickles its client. This seems to bring the larger fish back again for regular servicing.|$|E

[...] The Sie 3 lands on a monowheel well embedded within the fuselage, aided by a sprung tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{involved}} in controversy during the Melbourne derby on 6 January 2012 against the Shane Warne-led Melbourne Stars; during the Stars' innings, Samuels held back David Hussey at the non-striker's end when the batters were trying {{to take a second}} run off Samuels' bowling. Warne reacted angrily to this when he was later bowling to Samuels himself; he continuously sledged Samuels, asking if he was going [...] "grab hold of my shirt too, Marlon?" [...] The incident escalated when Warne, appearing to attempt to throw the ball to the wicket-keeper, tossed <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> at Samuels, who responded by throwing his bat in Warne's direction. This led to an angry confrontation between the two mid-pitch. Both players were suspended, but Samuels missed the rest of the BBL season in any case, as he received an injury due to a bouncer from Lasith Malinga in the same game. The pair have been far from kind about each other in interviews since this incident.|$|E
2500|$|Dynaflow was now {{standard}} equipment, {{and engine}} horsepower was increased to 150 through {{a slight increase}} in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of 110mph. In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster Riviera, along with the Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville and the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, was among the first hardtop coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional [...] "Sweepspear" [...] chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which <b>it</b> <b>gently</b> curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The [...] "Riviera trim", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a Cadillac Series 61.|$|E
