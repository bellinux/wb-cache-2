It is clear that the high leakage exponents often found in field studies are mainly caused by leak areas varying with system pressure, and a good understanding of the response of leaks <b>deforming</b> <b>elastically</b> has been developed.

40|$|Traditional blast {{protection}} systems present a hard metallic surface, which acts to deflect and attenuate the blast loading. However, more recently, lightweight energy absorbing materials, including cellular materials, are being considered. These materials reduce the transmitted force by <b>deforming</b> <b>elastically</b> or plastically under the blast load. In this study, four commercially available energy absorbing materials were considered for application in blast protection. The materials considered were aluminium foam, Nomex ® honeycomb, Skydex ® and expanded polystyrene. The impulse transmitted by the rear face of experimental test panels under blast loading {{was assessed by}} positioning a mass on the rear face {{of each of the}} four panels, the velocity of which was measured using high speed imaging. Measurements of the permanent deformation of the rear face of the panels were also taken. The aluminium foam recorded both the lowest permanent deformation and impulse transfer to the mass of the materials tested, making it the most suitable material of those tested for use as an appliqué panel in this particular scenario. Analysis of the panels suggested that for the particular experimental setup used, minimal energy was absorbed by plastic deformation or crushing of the energy absorbing materials. Instead, the permanent deformation of the panels {{may be related to the}} mechanical properties of the materials in the plane perpendicular to the blast load...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} and finishing of gears include several {{processes such as}} grinding, hobbing, shaving, honing, shot peening and phosphating. For the automotive industry it is a constant challenge to improve the durability and reduce the fuel consumption in a cost effective way by using robust processes for mass manufacturing. A better knowledge of {{the properties of the}} manufactured surfaces in gears, and especially how they interact in different combinations is an important knowledge when designing gearboxes for the future. The following paper proposes an efficient way for choosing the better {{manufacturing and}} predicting the behavior of new combinations of process parameters in the early stage of the design process based on simulations of 3 D surface measurements. The simulation model uses two rough surfaces of counterpart gear teeth contacting and <b>deforming</b> <b>elastically</b> under a typically critical load during operation. Outputs from the simulations are the pressure distribution and real contact area later used for ranking the differently manufactured surfaces. Four different types of surfaces were taken from manufacturing; samples were extracted and measured on a coherence scanning interferometer. Two surface types were ground differently and two were shot-peened with different process parameters. The results show the shot-peened surfaces, especially the double shot-peened type B 1, performed better than the ground ones manifested in larger real contact areas and lower/fewer pressure spikes. Based on the correlations of the 3 D roughness parameters with the simulation outputs, some roughness parameters are suggested for more robust quality control.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} tensile mechanical properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The comprehensive spectral information, such as Raman shift, width and intensity, are recorded during the whole loading–unloading–reloading procedures of CNT fibers. Based on the experimental results, the elastic-plastic deformation evolution of CNT fibers are analyzed at multi-scale levels. It is found that the elastic deformation of the fiber is mainly attributable to the elastic stretching of the CNTs inside the bundles. And the plastic deformation is caused mainly by the slippages at the interfaces among CNTs inside the bundles. Meanwhile, the CNTs <b>deform</b> <b>elastically</b> during the whole loading–unloading–reloading procedures...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMechanisms of superelasticity were {{investigated}} by in situ cyclic tensile tests performed under synchrotron X-ray radiation on Ti- 24 Nb- 0. 5 N and Ti- 24 Nb- 0. 5 O compns. of metastable β titanium alloys. Analyses of diffraction patterns acquired under load and after unloading for each cycle {{were used to}} det. {{the characteristics of the}} potential mechanisms of deformation in both alloys. The Ti- 24 Nb- 0. 5 N alloy exhibits the conventional behavior of superelastic β titanium alloys. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) expts. proved that superelasticity is exclusively due to the occurrence of a stress-induced martensitic (SIM) transformation from the β phase to the α'' phase. The evolution of vol. fraction of α'' martensite corresponds exactly to the variation of the recovery strain of the cyclic tensile curve. Conversely, the Ti- 24 Nb- 0. 5 O alloy displays a non-conventional behavior. SXRD expts. showed a huge ability of the β phase to <b>deform</b> <b>elastically</b> until 2. 1 %. Surprisingly, a reversible SIM transformation also occurs in this alloy but starts after 1 % of applied strain that corresponds to the yield point of the stress-strain curve. Although the SIM transformation occurs, the β phase simultaneously continues to <b>deform</b> <b>elastically.</b> The superelasticity of this alloy is unexpectedly due to a combination of a high elastic deformability of the β phase and a reversible SIM transformation. In both alloys, the lattice parameters of the α'' martensite evolve similarly in accordance with the initial texture of the β phase and the crystallog. of the transformation...|$|R

50|$|A {{material}} generally <b>deforms</b> <b>elastically</b> {{under the}} influence of small forces; the material returns quickly to its original shape when the deforming force is removed. This phenomenon is called elastic deformation. This behavior in materials is described by Hooke's Law. Materials behave <b>elastically</b> until the <b>deforming</b> force increases beyond the elastic limit, which is also known as the yield stress. At that point, the material is permanently deformed and fails to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This phenomenon is called plastic deformation. For example, if one stretches a coil spring up to a certain point, it will return to its original shape, but once it is stretched beyond the elastic limit, it will remain deformed and won't return to its original state.|$|R
50|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{includes the}} crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer {{layer of the}} Earth. The lithosphere is subdivided into tectonic plates. The uppermost part of the lithosphere that chemically reacts to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere through the soil forming process is called the pedosphere. The lithosphere is underlain by the asthenosphere which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. The Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary is defined by a difference in response to stress: the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it <b>deforms</b> <b>elastically</b> and through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere deforms viscously and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.
