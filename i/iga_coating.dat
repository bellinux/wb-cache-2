40|$|SummarySpecific {{members of}} the {{intestinal}} microbiota dramatically affect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. In humans, however, identifying bacteria that preferentially affect disease susceptibility and severity remains a major challenge. Here, we used flow-cytometry-based bacterial cell sorting and 16 S sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) and show that high <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> uniquely identifies colitogenic intestinal bacteria in a mouse model of microbiota-driven colitis. We then used IgA-SEQ and extensive anaerobic culturing of fecal bacteria from IBD patients to create personalized disease-associated gut microbiota culture collections with predefined levels of <b>IgA</b> <b>coating.</b> Using these collections, we found that intestinal bacteria {{selected on the basis}} of high coating with IgA conferred dramatic susceptibility to colitis in germ-free mice. Thus, our studies suggest that <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> identifies inflammatory commensals that preferentially drive intestinal disease. Targeted elimination of such bacteria may reduce, reverse, or even prevent disease development...|$|E
40|$|IgA is induced through T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways. In this issue, Bunker et al. (2015) now {{show that}} the T-cell-independent pathway is {{sufficient}} to coat most small intestinal microbes specifically, and Fransen et al. (2015) find that <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> promotes uptake of microbes into Peyer’s patches and drives further induction in a positive-feedback loop...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} whether quantitative or qualitative IgA deficiencies in cervicovaginal secretions {{can be identified}} in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. DESIGN [...] Prospective and controlled study. SETTING [...] Department of Dermatology, University of Vienna. SUBJECTS [...] 30 patients with symptomatic and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis {{at the time of}} their presentation. 30 healthy women as a control group. INTERVENTION [...] Blood samples were drawn for measurement of serum IgA levels. Smears of the cervix and vagina were taken for direct microscopy and microbiological culture. Lavage of the vagina and ectocervix was performed with sterile saline solution for measurement of cervicovaginal IgA levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] IgA levels of serum and cervicovaginal secretion evaluated by Single Radial Immunodiffusion. IgA labelling was demonstrated on fungal elements in vaginal smears and subcultured blastospores after incubation with vaginal secretions by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS [...] We could not find any significant difference of IgA levels in serum and cervicovaginal secretions between the symptomatic group and healthy controls (p value for serum = 0. 5796, p value for secretion = 0. 2381). In vaginal smears yeasts revealed <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> on their surfaces, whereas three of the 61 subcultures were negative. Negative subcultures were assigned to three patients with recurrent candidiasis. No correlation was found between IgA levels of cervicovaginal secretions and staining intensity of subcultured blastospores after incubation with vaginal secretions (r = - 0. 0578). IgA levels of serum and vaginal secretion showed no correlation (r = - 0. 00012). CONCLUSION [...] Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis cannot be attributed to IgA deficiency. In some cases an <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> defect of yeasts might be involved. In addition inactivation of the IgA molecule by candida proteases might be of pathogenetic importance...|$|E

The mean level in healthy individuals was 5 · 2 μg/ml. Decreased levels {{are found in}} cord sera and the sera of IgA deficient individuals.

Elevated levels were found in the sera of lactating women, patients with acute chest infection, and patients with sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
50|$|IgA {{prevents}} {{entry and}} colonization of pathogenic {{bacteria in the}} gut. It can be found as a monomer, dimer, or tetramer, which means that it can bind multiple antigens simultaneously. In a process called immune exclusion, <b>IgA</b> <b>coats</b> pathogenic bacterial and viral surfaces. This prevents their attachment to mucosal cells, which is required for colonization. IgA can also neutralize MAMPs. IgA can also promote the development of TH17 and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Given its critical function in the GI tract, the number of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the jejunum {{is greater than the}} total plasma cell population of the bone marrow, lymph, and spleen combined.|$|R

The presence and population density of organisms {{was associated with the}} presence of intraepithelial neutrophils. In vivo coating of the organisms by host immunoglobulin was investigated by immunoperoxidase staining of IgA, IgG, and IgM in 54 biopsy specimens. <b>IgA</b> <b>coated</b> bacteria were seen in all cases of active gastritis, and in 60 % of biopsy specimens without intraepithelial neutrophils. Coating with IgG or IgM, or both, was correlated with activity of gastritis and was rarely seen {{in the absence of a}} neutrophil infiltrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} gut {{contains an}} incredibly diverse and abundant bacterial community that makes essential contributions to host metabolism and immune system priming. The close {{proximity of the}} intestinal epithelium with the gut microbiota poses serious challenges to the host, who in turn has developed {{a complex set of}} physical and immunological mechanisms to effectively manage this host-microbe relationship. A defect in any one of these mechanisms can result in opportunistic invasion of host tissues by otherwise commensal bacteria and this breakdown in homeostasis may contribute to numerous metabolic and gastrointestinal pathologies. Here, I investigate the role of two such mechanisms in maintaining homeostasis: Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR 5), the innate immune receptor for bacterial flagellin, as well as IgA, which has previously been indicated to be aberrant in abundance and antigen specificity in the absence of TLR 5. Using metatranscriptomics and biochemical assays, I found that TLR 5 -/- mice harbor a bacterial community that exhibits increased flagellation. I also found that TLR 5 is required to synthesize the amount of anti-flagellin IgA observed in healthy WT mice, and flagellin load appears to share an inverse relationship with levels of anti-flagellin IgA. I performed 16 S rRNA analysis of the gut microbiota in mice with or without the capacity for producing IgA to better understand how IgA influences the stability and resilience of the bacterial community. Indeed, the lack of IgA resulted in reduced temporal stability and reduced community evenness, as well as increased susceptibility to antibiotic-induced perturbation. To specifically investigate the influence of TLR 5 on <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> of the gut microbiota, I used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) combined with 16 S rRNA analysis and found that the bacterial community of TLR 5 -/- mice displays an aberrant profile of <b>IgA</b> <b>coating,</b> including reduced coating of Proteobacteria and increased coating of Firmicutes. With a combination of immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and fluorescent microscopy of intestinal tissues, I observed that TLR 5 -/- mice have a defective mucosal barrier that results in bacterial invasion of villi in the small intestine and penetration deep into the colonic mucus layer. Together, these results highlight the critical role of TLR 5 in maintaining gut homeostasis through directing the synthesis of anti-flagellin IgA and thus reducing levels of flagellation and motility in the bacterial community. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flora {{in the human}} colon, although extremely diverse, has a relatively stable composition and non-infectious anaerobic bacteria are dominant. The flora forms a pool of numerous different antigens separated from mucosal immunocompetent cells by just a single layer of epithelial cells. Despite this thin barrier, however, the colonic mucosa is physiologically only mildly inflamed. This study looked at the mucosal humoral immune response against faecal anaerobes. By flow cytometric analysis the in vivo immunoglobulin coating of anaerobic bacteria in faecal samples of 22 healthy human volunteers was determined. In a previous study flow cytometric analysis of faecal bacteria {{has been found to}} be a very sensitive method to detect immunoglobulins on faecal bacteria. This technique showed that in vivo many bacteria are coated with IgA (24 - 74 %) and less with IgG and IgM. The presence of many bacteria coated with IgA implies that <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> does not result in permanent removal of the species from the colon. The absence of immunoglobulin coating suggests that there is immunological unresponsiveness for anaerobic bacterial antigens. It is concluded that both immunological unresponsiveness and preferential coating with IgA are responsible for the relative absence of colonic mucosal inflammation...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a flow cytometry method {{for analysis of}} noncultured anaerobic bacteria present in human fecal suspensions. Nonbacterial fecal compounds, bacterial fragments, and large aggregates could be discriminated from bacteria by staining with propidium iodide (PI) and setting a discriminator on PI fluorescence and by exclusion of events with large forward scatter. Since anaerobic bacteria, which account for over 99. 9 % of all fecal bacteria, die during sample preparation, a fixation step was not necessary. A second {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the technical possibility of measurement of in vivo <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> of fecal anaerobic bacteria as well as their bacterial size. Fecal samples of 22 healthy human volunteers were analyzed. The fluorescence distribution of IgA-coated bacteria labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -anti-Hu-IgA had overlap with noncoated bacteria. However, with match region subtraction, detection of low levels of specific FITC fluorescence on IgA-coated bacteria was achieved. The median bacterial two-dimensional surface area was 1. 0 mu m(2). To validate flow cytometry data, all samples were analyzed with an image analysis system as well. With this new method, a rapid evaluation of fecal flora with high sensitivity for specific FITC fluorescence is possible without culturing. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
50|$|Colostrum is {{the first}} milk a breastfed baby receives. It {{contains}} higher amounts of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and is especially high in immunoglobulin A (<b>IgA),</b> which <b>coats</b> {{the lining of the}} baby's immature intestines, and helps to prevent pathogens from invading the baby's system. Secretory IgA also helps prevent food allergies. Over the first two weeks after the birth, colostrum production slowly gives way to mature breast milk.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{influence}} of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin, women produce milk after childbirth to feed the baby. The initial milk produced is referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin <b>IgA,</b> which <b>coats</b> the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly. It also creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build-up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice).|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} identified {{lectin pathway}} of the complement system, initiated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to its ligands, {{is a key}} component of innate immunity. MBL-deficient individuals show an increased susceptibility for infections, espe-cially of the mucosal system. We examined whether IgA, an important mediator of mucosal immunity, activates the complement system via the lectin pathway. Our results indicate a dose-dependent binding of MBL to polymeric, but not monomeric <b>IgA</b> <b>coated</b> in microtiter plates. This interaction involves the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL, because it was calcium dependent and inhibited by mannose and by mAb against this domain of MBL. Binding of MBL to IgA induces complement activation, as demonstrated by a dose-dependent deposition of C 4 and C 3 upon addition of a complement source. The MBL concentrations required for IgA-induced C 4 and C 3 activation are well below the normal MBL plasma concentrations. In line with these experiments, serum from individuals having mutations in the MBL gene showed significantly less activation of C 4 by IgA and mannan than serum from wild-type individuals. We conclude that MBL binding to IgA results in complement activation, which is proposed to lead to a synergistic action of MBL and IgA in antimicrobial defense. Furthermore, our results may explain glomerular complement deposition in IgA nephropathy. The Journal of Immunology, 2001, 167 : 2861 – 2868. T he complement system is an important component of hostdefense. Activation of the complement cascade takesplace upon the interaction of complement components with a variety of pathogens, either directly or via Abs bound to pathogen Ags.

40|$|Background: Although {{a reduced}} gut {{microbiota}} diversity and low mucosal total IgA levels in infancy {{have been associated}} with allergy development, IgA responses to the gut microbiota have not yet been studied. Objective: We sought to determine the proportions of <b>IgA</b> <b>coating</b> together with the characterization of the dominant bacteria, bound to IgA or not, in infant stool samples in relation to allergy development. Methods: A combination of flow cytometric cell sorting and deep sequencing of the 16 S rDNA gene was used to characterize the bacterial recognition patterns by IgA in stool samples collected at 1 and 12 months of age from children staying healthy or having allergic symptoms up to 7 years of age. Results: The children with allergic manifestations, particularly asthma, during childhood had a lower proportion of IgA bound to fecal bacteria at 12 months of age compared with healthy children. These alterations cannot be attributed to differences in IgA levels or bacterial load between the 2 groups. Moreover, the bacterial targets of early IgA responses (including coating of the Bacteroides genus), as well as IgA recognition patterns, differed between healthy children and children with allergic manifestations. Altered IgA recognition patterns in children with allergy were observed already at 1 month of age, when the IgA antibodies are predominantly maternally derived in breast-fed children. Conclusion: An aberrant IgAresponsiveness to the gutmicrobiota during infancy precedes asthma and allergy development, possibly indicating an impaired mucosal barrier function in allergic children.

40|$|As {{a member}} of the {{indigenous}} gut mucosal microbiota, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) colonize the guts of a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates. They are potent microbial stimuli of the gut mucosal immune system. In the small intestines of mice and rats, it has been observed that SFB are absent during the suckling period and appear in high numbers shortly after weaning, then quickly retreat to the cecum and large intestine. In this study, we explored whether this microecological phenomenon resulted from the interaction between SFB and the passively acquired maternal mucosal immunity and/or the actively acquired mucosal immunity. We set up a mouse model by reciprocal crossings and backcrossings of SFB-monoassociated, formerly germ-free, immunocompetent (+/+) BALB/c mice and immunodeficient (scid/scid) mice to produce pups which are either immunocompetent (scid/+) or immunodeficient (scid/scid) and are born either to immunocompetent (scid/+) mothers or to immunodeficient (scid/scid) mothers. We monitored the number of SFB on the mucosa of the small intestine in the four different groups of mice after birth, as well as the level of passively acquired antibodies, the active gut mucosal immune responses, and immunoglobulin A (<b>IgA)</b> <b>coating</b> of SFB in the gut. The results showed that, irrespective of whether the pups were scid/scid or scid/+, SFB could be found earlier on the mucosa of the small intestine in pups born to scid/scid mothers, appearing from day 13 and rapidly reaching a climax around weaning time on day 28, compared to the significantly delayed colonization in the pups of scid/+ mothers, starting from day 16 and peaking around days 28 to 32, After the climax, SFB quickly declined to very low levels in the small intestines of scid/+ pups of either scid/scid mothers or scid/+ mothers, whereas they remained at high levels in scid/scid pups at least until day 70, the last observation time in this study, The dynamic changes in SFB colonization of the small intestines of the different groups of pups {{may be related to the}} dynamic changes in the levels of SFB coated,vith secretory IgA (sIgA), which resulted from the significantly different levels of sIgA obtained from the mothers' milk during the suckling period and, later, of self-produced sIgA in the small intestine. Nevertheless, it is evident that the timing, localization, and persistence of colonization of the neonatal gut by SFB depends on the immune status of both mothers and pups...|$|E
40|$|Heat or {{chemically}} aggregated IgA or IgG stimulated degranulation of neutrophils with comparable efficiency. The same aggregates induced a neutrophil respiratory burst {{which could}} be measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. Serum IgA 1 or <b>IgA</b> 2 <b>coated</b> onto microtitre plates were both capable of inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils, as was secretory IgA 1 or secretory IgA 2. All bursts were of similar size for a given concentration of IgA and were greater than the burst elicited by an equivalent concentration of IgG. For each subclass of IgA the respiratory bursts were dependent on their density on the opsonized surface. Since monomeric and dimeric forms present in secretory IgA preparations both elicit a respiratory burst in neutrophils, secretory component and J chain cannot block the receptor binding site on the Fc region. The potential of secretory IgA {{to act as an}} opsonin might have important consequences on mucosal surfaces where the availability of complement components is limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of secretory IgA in controlling the microbiota is well known, yet how the antibody affects {{the perception of}} the commensals by the local immune system is still poorly defined. We have previously shown that the transport of secretory IgA in complex with bacteria across intestinal microfold cells results in an association with dendritic cells in Peyer's patches. However, the consequences of such an interaction on dendritic cell conditioning have not been elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the impact of the commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus, alone or associated with secretory IgA, on the responsiveness of dendritic cells freshly recovered from mouse Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Lactobacillus rhamnosus-conditioned mucosal dendritic cells are characterized by increased expression of Toll-like receptor regulatory proteins [including single immunoglobulin interleukin- 1 receptor-related molecule, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, and Toll-interacting molecule] and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, low surface expression of co-stimulatory markers, high anti- versus pro-inflammatory cytokine production ratios, and induction of T regulatory cells with suppressive function. Association with secretory IgA enhanced the anti-inflammatory/regulatory Lactobacillus rhamnosus-induced conditioning of mucosal dendritic cells, particularly in Peyer's patches. At the systemic level, activation of splenic dendritic cells exposed to Lactobacillus rhamnosus was partially dampened upon association with secretory IgA. These data suggest that secretory <b>IgA,</b> through <b>coating</b> of commensal bacteria, contributes to the conditioning of mucosal dendritic cells toward tolerogenic profiles essential for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Enzyme linked and radioimmune direct antiglobulin tests (DAGTs) {{were used}} to assess red cell bound IgG, IgA, and IgM in 585 {{patients}} referred to an immunohaematology reference centre.

The presence of autoimmune haemolysis was determined from the clinical, haematological, and biochemical findings; it occurred in at least 25 % of the 158 patients, the degree varying widely. There was a highly significant association between small increases in cell bound immunoglobulins and the presence of autoimmune haemolysis. Immunoglobulins of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes could produce autoimmune haemolysis when the classical agglutination DAGTs were negative; the IgA and IgM were usually found in association with IgG.

40|$|Antibody {{coating of}} yeasts (Candida sp. and Torulopsis sp.) found in urine {{specimens}} was investigated {{to ascertain whether}} the presence of such coating might identify the site of urinary tract infection. Washed yeast cells obtained by centrifugation of fresh urine specimens were reacted with fluorescein-conjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M and examined by fluorescent microscopy. IgG {{was found on the}} surface of all species of yeast encountered in all urine specimens evaluted, whereas there was variability of <b>IgA</b> AND IgM <b>coating.</b> Antibody <b>coating</b> with IgG, <b>IgA,</b> AND IgM was also demonstrated on yeasts from other body sites (sputum, gastrostomy, oral, etc.). Control experiments confirmed the specificity of the reactions. Thus, it appears that yeasts from any body site are coated with antibodies. These results are in contrast to recent work with bacteria which showed that the presence of antibody-coated (IgG) bacteria indicates upper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis) while bacteria are not coated with antibodies in lower urinary tract infection. Since all yeasts from all body sites tested were found to be coated with antibody regardless of the clinical situation, the presence of surface antibody has no diagnostic value in identifying the site of urinary tract infection with yeasts...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} rat {{monoclonal}} IgA, specific for 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNA), {{to activate the}} complement (C) system of the rat was investigated using aggregated IgA or IgA immune complexes (IC). <b>IgA</b> was <b>coated</b> onto a solid phase, and tested for its capacity to bind C 3 upon incubation at 37 degrees C in normal rat serum (NRS) {{in the presence of}} Mg-EGTA. Binding of C 3 was observed dependent on the dose of dimeric (d-), polymeric (p-) and secretory IgA tested. In contrast, little C 3 fixation was observed in this system with monomeric (m-) rat IgA or with mouse m- and d-IgA (MOPC 315). Soluble and insoluble rat IgA IC were prepared using dinitrophenylated rat serum albumin (DNP 8 RSA) as antigen (Ag), and assessed for C activation. It was shown that insoluble IC (immune precipitates; IP) containing m-, d- or pIgA of rat origin activate the alternative pathway of rat C, as demonstrated by their capacity to induce C consumption in NRS in the presence of Mg-EGTA. When p- and m-IgA IP were compared for their capacity to activate C, it was found that p-IgA activated C four times as efficiently as m-IgA IP (at 2 mg/ml). Soluble rat IgA IC were prepared in an excess of DNP 8 RSA, fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose 6 B, and analyzed for C activation and antibody (Ab) /Ag ratio. In contrast to m-IgA IP, soluble m-IgA did not activate C. On the other hand soluble d-IgA IC activated C dependent on their concentration and size: at a concentration of 0. 1 mg/ml high-molecular weight d-IgA IC with a high Ab/Ag ratio were four times as efficient as low-molecular weight IC with a low Ab/Ag ratio, and twice as efficient as IP prepared at equivalence. To demonstrate the induction by IgA of the assembly of the terminal membrane attack complex, trinitrophenyl (TNP) -conjugated rat red blood cells (TNP-RRBC) coated with d- or p-IgA were shown to be lysed in NRS in the presence of Mg-EGTA. No lysis of m-IgA-coated TNP-RRBC was observed. The results in this study demonstrate that both soluble and insoluble rat IgA IC activate the alternative pathway of homologous rat C. Alternative pathway activation by soluble rate IgA IC is dependent {{on the size of the}} IC. The degree of polymerization of the IgA Ab itself also influences C activation...|$|R
