On January 30, 2009, Steele won {{the chairmanship of the}} RNC in the sixth round, with 91 votes to Dawson's 77. Steele, the Republican Party's first African American chief, was selected in the aftermath of President Obama's election, when many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> saw him as a charismatic counter to the first black president.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{began in}} 2004 that Hutchison would run for Governor of Texas in 2006, {{challenging}} incumbent Governor Rick Perry in the Republican primary. However, on June 17, 2005, Hutchison {{announced that she}} would seek reelection to the Senate instead, reneging on an earlier promise to a two-term limit. Many political analysts speculated {{that she did not}} believe she could defeat Perry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> primary because of his popularity among Christian conservatives, while her Senate seat was unlikely to face a serious threat.|$|E

2500|$|On May 23, 2011, Pawlenty {{launched}} his candidacy {{for president in}} a speech in Iowa stating: [...] "I'm going to try something a little unusual in politics. I'm just going to tell the truth." [...] A YouTube video appeared a day before.

25|$|In 1974 Richardson {{gave the}} {{commencement}} address at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and received an honorary Doctors of Law. In 1980, Richardson received an honorary degree from Bates College. In 1983, Richardson was admitted as an honorary {{member of the}} Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. In 1984, {{he ran for the}} Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Paul Tsongas. Although Richardson was favored to win the seat, he was defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> primary by more conservative candidate Ray Shamie, who lost the general election to John F. Kerry.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 2007, Brownback {{finished}} third in the Ames Straw Poll with 15.3 percent of all votes cast. Fundraising and visits to his website declined dramatically after this event, as many supporters had predicted Brownback would do much better, and speculation began that the candidate was considering withdrawing from the campaign. This sentiment increased after his lackluster performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> presidential debate of September 5, broadcast from New Hampshire by Fox News Channel. He dropped out of the race on October 18, 2007, citing a lack of funds. He formally announced his decision on October 19. He later endorsed John McCain for president.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010 a Rasmussen report {{showed that}} Pawlenty had a 49% {{approval}} rating among Minnesotans with 49% disapproving. A March 2011 survey by Gallup stated that Pawlenty began his Presidential run with only 41% name recognition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> Also in March 2011, the Public Policy Polling (PPP) agency found that nationwide voters had a net negative view of Pawlenty, with 15% viewing him favorably verses 33% unfavorably. In a 2011 PPP poll of registered Minnesota voters conducted from May 27–30, 42% of Minnesotans had a favorable opinion of Pawlenty, while 52% had an unfavorable opinion of him. In the presidential race, President Obama lead Pawlenty by 51% to 43%, suggesting Pawlenty could lose {{his home state}} to President Obama were he the 2012 GOP nominee.|$|E
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of CIF, {{the gains}} of the {{proposed}} framework over <b>the</b> existing ones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>GOP</b> = 9 are somewhat larger than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>GOP</b> = 15. However, the gains of both <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> cases look quite similar. These could well be reasoned by the different distributions of DVFI between these two GOP cases, as aforementioned in Section 4.2 and Figures 10 to 11.|$|R

25|$|In 1956, District Attorney Ragan Madden of Lincoln and Union parishes filed {{to oppose}} Passman. Not once did a Republican {{candidate}} oppose Passman in his fifteen terms <b>in</b> office; <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> at <b>the</b> {{time was a}} mostly moribund institution in Louisiana.|$|R
25|$|After being Governor of Massachusetts, Weld {{moved to}} New York in 2000. On April 24, 2005, it was {{reported}} that he was in talks with the New York Republicans to run for Governor of New York in 2006, against likely Democratic nominee Eliot Spitzer. Incumbent GOP Governor George Pataki announced on July 27 that he would not seek a fourth term. On August 19, 2005, Weld officially announced his candidacy for Governor of New York, seeking to become the second person after Sam Houston to serve as governor of two different U.S. states. His main opponent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> race was former Assembly Minority Leader John Faso. Early in the campaign, former New York Secretary of State Randy Daniels and Assemblyman Patrick R. Manning also waged campaigns for the governorship.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Montgomery {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Louisiana Committee for Free Electors, an organization that grew from a meeting of some two hundred conservative Democrats in Baton Rouge. Two representatives from each congressional district were chosen. Montgomery called for the free elector slate to remain viable {{in the event that}} Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York were named the national Republican nominee or if the Republican platform was too liberal to include conservatives. Another free-elector supporter, Taylor W. O'Hearn, subsequently one of the first two Republican members of the Louisiana House of Representatives since Reconstruction, called for electors being chosen by congressional district, rather than at-large statewide. O'Hearn also cited major differences between the two parties despite the influence of such liberals as Rockefeller and U.S. Senator Jacob Javits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> Ultimately, the free elector movement was abandoned with the nomination in July 1964 of U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona as the Republican nominee.|$|E
500|$|California Republicans were {{impressed}} with Reagan's political views and charisma after his [...] "Time for Choosing" [...] speech, and in late 1965 he announced his campaign for Governor of California in the 1966 election. He defeated former San Francisco mayor George Christopher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> primary. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: [...] "to send the welfare bums back to work," [...] and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley, [...] "to {{clean up the mess}} at Berkeley." [...] In 1966, Reagan accomplished what both U.S. Senator William F. Knowland in 1958 and former Vice President Richard Nixon in 1962 had attempted to do: he was elected, defeating two-term governor Edmund G. [...] "Pat" [...] Brown, and was sworn in on January 2, 1967. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.|$|E
50|$|Blount was handily {{defeated}} by Sparkman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1972; {{so long as}} George Wallace remained the dominant political power in Alabama, particularly after the ban on consecutive gubernatorial reelection was lifted <b>in</b> 1974, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> faced few prospects of a breakthrough.|$|R
50|$|Dreyfus beat Kasten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> September <b>GOP</b> primary, {{and went}} on to defeat then-incumbent Acting Governor Martin Schreiber, a Democrat, with about 55 percent of the vote. He became the state's 40th governor.|$|R

2500|$|Coleman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of President Bush's attempts in 2006 and 2007 to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S. Senate, one of the few Republicans to do so despite the insistence of many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> that it was [...] "amnesty for illegal aliens".|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Sanders {{defeated}} Hillary Clinton by 22 points. Sanders claimed 151,584 {{votes in}} total, earning him 15 delegates, while Clinton managed 95,252 votes with 9 delegates.

2500|$|Other {{political}} campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing {{the power of}} social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their {{political campaigns}}, for example Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016.

2500|$|Following the {{hospitalization}} of {{his daughter}} Bella and losses in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, Santorum announced the suspension of his campaign on April 10, 2012, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

2500|$|Boehner {{has been}} {{classified}} as a [...] "hard-core conservative" [...] by OnTheIssues.

According to the Washington Post: [...] "From illegal immigration to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs." ...|$|E
25|$|While the Republican Party {{has been}} {{historically}} dominant in Schuylkill County politics, Democrats became dominant {{at the county}} level after the 2007 elections.

Former State Representative Dave Argall won the special election of March 3 to succeed the late State Senator Jim Rhoades and was sworn in on March 17.

500|$|In 1983, when Lugar {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Daniels was appointed its executive director.

[...] Other talk radio hosts also subjected McCain to criticism for being insufficiently conservative. Prominent conservative radio host Michael Medved said after McCain's win that talk radio was the [...] "big loser" [...] of the primary, adding that the medium has [...] "unmistakably collapsed in terms of impact, influence and credibility because of its hysterical and one-dimensional involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> nomination fight." ...|$|E
