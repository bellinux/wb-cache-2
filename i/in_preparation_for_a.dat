5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed <b>in</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, {{on the basis that}} such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
