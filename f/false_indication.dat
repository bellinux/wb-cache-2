25|$|As the air {{pressure}} decreases at altitudes {{above sea level}} (and increases below sea level) the uncorrected reading of the barometer will depend on its location. The reading is then adjusted to an equivalent sea-level pressure for purposes of reporting. For example, if a barometer located at sea level and under fair weather conditions is moved to an altitude of 1,000 feet (305m), about 1 inch of mercury (~35 hPa) must be added on to the reading. The barometer readings at the two locations {{should be the same}} if there are negligible changes in time, horizontal distance, and temperature. If this were not done, there would be a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of an approaching storm at the higher elevation.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudohyperkalemia, a [...] rise in {{the amount}} of {{potassium}} that occurs due to its excessive leakage from red blood cells (RBCs) when blood is drawn. This can give a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of hyperkalemia on lab tests, hence the prefix pseudo, meaning false. This occurs because many eastern Asian breeds, including Akitas and Shiba Inus, have a higher level of potassium in their RBCs than other dogs.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-300 {{registered}} VH-QPA, travelling from Singapore Changi Airport to Perth, Western Australia as Qantas Flight 72, {{suffered a}} rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch down manoeuvres causing serious injuries while [...] from Learmonth. The aircraft safely landed in Learmonth, with 14 people requiring transportation by air ambulance to Perth. Another 30 people also required hospital treatment, while an additional 30 people had injuries not requiring hospital treatment. Initial investigations identified an {{inertial reference system}} fault in the Number-1 Air Data Inertial Reference Unit as the likely origin of the event. On receiving <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of a very high angle of attack, the flight control systems commanded a pitch down movement, reaching a maximum of 8.5 degrees pitch down.|$|E
2500|$|About {{two minutes}} later, ADIRU No. 1, which was {{providing}} {{data to the}} captain's primary flight display, provided very high (and <b>false)</b> <b>indications</b> for the aircraft's angle of attack (AOA), leading to: ...|$|R
40|$|The anaërobic spore {{test for}} manurial {{pollution}} of milk has certain definite advantages.

50|$|The theory {{presented}} {{in the book is}} now called the omphalos hypothesis: that the world and everything in it could have been created at any time, even mere moments ago, with even our own memories being <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> of its age. This is a largely philosophical position, not a scientific one.|$|R
2500|$|When any {{of these}} sensors is activated, the game {{registers}} a [...] "tilt" [...] and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end {{the ball in play}} on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a [...] "slam tilt" [...] switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.|$|E
50|$|Another safety {{consideration}} is how sensors are wired. If a device {{is capable of}} failing in a particular state, then the failure should be such that a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of pressure is given. This is far better than a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of no pressure.|$|E
50|$|There are {{penalties}} {{for making a}} <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> {{of the existence of}} patent rights for any invention.|$|E
2500|$|We {{suggest that}} these aims may be {{achieved}} by an integrated program designed to reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of Inimical forces behind the phenomenon, to train personnel to recognize and reject <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> quickly and effectively, and to strengthen regular channels {{for the evaluation of}} and prompt reaction to true indications of hostile measures.” ...|$|R
50|$|Also, two Congresses {{were held}} in 1908 and 1909, one in Geneva {{and the other in}} Paris, to examine this {{worrying}} problem and serious progress was made in proposing a first definition of wine and in recalling and confirming the principles of the Madrid Convention of 14 April 1891 concerning the suppression of <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> of provenance.|$|R
5000|$|Trademark violations: Infringing on the {{rightfully}} owned trademarks, hallmarks, {{symbols and}} any other distinctive signs of a reputed watch brand, with or without complete trade-dress or design violation.

They, including the crew of Flight 404, were unaware of the possible <b>false</b> <b>indication.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{difference is}} the addition of nickel oxyhydroxide to the manganese dioxide and graphite for the cathode. This results in an unloaded voltage of 1.7 V DC per cell. The cells sustain a higher average voltage during discharge compared to alkaline batteries. This may cause a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> in equipment that monitors battery voltage {{as an indication of}} remaining operating time.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudohyperkalemia, {{a rise in}} {{the amount}} of {{potassium}} that occurs due to its excessive leakage from red blood cells (RBCs) when blood is drawn.

This occurs because many eastern Asian breeds, including Akitas and Shiba Inus, have a higher level of potassium in their RBCs than other dogs.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{uncommon}} faults in wiring {{may give}} a good indication on a receptacle tester, but the receptacle may still not work for actual appliances. The lamps in the tester require very little current to light and a high-resistance joint or a stray voltage may give <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> on the tester. [...] The lights in the receptacle tester do not indicate that the voltage (or frequency) is correct, only that some voltage is present.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} study for microscopic lens thermography observations on a film-like and non-blackbody material. With this aim, {{a number of}} features present {{on the surface of}} a cardboard for storage boxes (grammage 300 g/m) are observed using a Flir SC 3000 thermal imager microscopic lens with 26 mm fixed focal distance. Comments on quality of observation and on probability of <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> depending on on the depth of the features observed are supplied, in particular concentrating on transient time for observation during cooling following illumination and on thermal gradients measured...|$|R
50|$|Indication : The {{response}} or {{evidence from}} an examination, {{such as a}} blip on the screen of an instrument. Indications are classified as true or <b>false.</b> <b>False</b> <b>indications</b> are those caused by factors {{not related to the}} principles of the testing method or by improper implementation of the method, like film damage in radiography, electrical interference in ultrasonic testing etc. True indications are further classified as relevant and non relevant. Relevant indications are those caused by flaws. Non relevant indications are those caused by known features of the tested object, like gaps, threads, case hardening etc.|$|R
50|$|A {{receptacle}} tester (outlet tester or socket tester) {{plugs into}} an outlet, and can detect {{some types of}} wiring errors. The particular error in wiring is shown by various combinations of three lights. Detectable errors include reversed hot/neutral, missing electrical ground or neutral, and others. However, leakage current through surge protective metal oxide varistors connected between neutral and ground of a power strip can give a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> that a ground connection exists.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 April 2007, American presidential {{candidate}} John McCain, {{in an effort}} to illustrate that the security situation had improved, visited the Shorjh marketplace.

Indiana Representative Mike Pence was also criticized for visiting the market, under large security including helicopters overhead, and saying it was [...] "like a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime." ...|$|E
5000|$|The fuzzy and {{confused}} official announcements up to 31 July gave increasing hints that a lightning strike caused some wayside-mounted piece of signal equipment to malfunction (the official investigation report in December 2011 identified a trackside LKD2-T1 signal assembly which malfunctioned after {{being struck by}} lightning, causing a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> in the control center that a section of track was unoccupied). If the equipment was not fail-safe, an incorrect response by staff could then cause an accident. Significantly, on 28 July 2011, An Lusheng [...] "faulted the quality of equipment, personnel and on-site controls. He described safeguards as 'still quite weak'." ...|$|E
50|$|Pulse code cab signals work {{by sending}} metered pulses along an {{existing}} AC track circuit operating at some chosen carrier frequency. The pulses are detected via induction by a sensor hanging {{a few inches}} above the rail before the leading set of wheels. The codes are measured in pulses per minute and for the 4-aspect PRR system are set at 180 ppm for Clear, 120 ppm for Approach Medium, 75 ppm for Approach and 0 for Restricting. The pulse rates are chosen to avoid any one rate being a multiple of another leading to reflected harmonics causing <b>false</b> <b>indications.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The main {{advantages}} of DPI are {{the speed of}} the test and the low cost. Disadvantages include the detection of only surface flaws, skin irritation, and the inspection should be on a smooth clean surface where excessive penetrant can be removed prior to being developed. Conducting the test on rough surfaces, such as [...] "as-welded" [...] welds, will make it difficult to remove any excessive penetrant and could result in <b>false</b> <b>indications.</b> Water-washable penetrant should be considered here if no other option is available. Also, on certain surfaces a great enough color contrast cannot be achieved or the dye will stain the workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|The test {{surface is}} cleaned {{to remove any}} dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep {{penetrant}} out of a defect, or cause irrelevant or <b>false</b> <b>indications.</b> Cleaning methods may include solvents, alkaline cleaning steps, vapor degreasing, or media blasting. The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present {{are open to the}} surface, dry, and free of contamination. Note that if media blasting is used, it may [...] "work over" [...] small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.|$|R

50|$|In {{the period}} between the years 2000 and 2002, 13 more Saab 340Bs were added to replace Metros, with a peak fleet of 22 Saab 340B's.On {{the third quarter of}} 2001, {{services}} to San Diego via Mexicali, to Zacatecas via Puerto Vallarta, and Monterrey were launched. Nevertheless, these services were discontinued shortly after 9/11 Attacks. On September 6, 2001, there was an accident without any fatalities, it was a Saab 340B's with registration XA-ACK which crash-landed 15 miles southeast of Tijuana. The airplane suffered fuel starvation, due to a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> in the flight deck fuel gauges, caused by a defective element on the system, reflecting more fuel than the aircraft actually had.|$|E
50|$|The early Jazz series-lead {{seemed like}} a distant memory, a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of a tough series as they hit the floor for Game 5 behind 3-1.

But any notions of a championship at the United Center would be snuffed out when Michael Jordan airballed an off-balance 3 {{to the right of}} the basket giving the Jazz a narrow 83-81 win. The play might have been for Toni Kukoč to shoot a three. With the series shifting back to Utah with a far more generous 3-2 Bulls advantage, the promise of another Chicago championship was not so certain.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{attempts}} at defining a coherent structure {{can be done}} through examining the correlation between their momenta or pressure and their turbulent flows. However, it often leads to <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> of turbulence, since pressure and velocity fluctuations over a fluid could be well correlated {{in the absence of}} any turbulence or vorticity. Some coherent structures, such as [...] vortex rings, etc. can be large-scale motions comparable to the extent of the shear flow. There are also coherent motions at much smaller scales such as hairpin vortices and typical eddies, which are typically known as coherent substructures, as in coherent structures which can be broken up into smaller more elementary substructures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{viewing angle}} for the {{searchlight}} beam, though narrow, is enormously powerful. Initial range was {{in excess of}} one mile {{and that was in}} 1918. Deflecting cover glasses are used to give a spread of the indication on non tangent track as needed. Again, to display more than three aspects, multiple heads are used as is standard U.S. practice, that of A.H. Rudd's 1915 [...] "Speed Signalling System." [...] Searchlight signals have the disadvantage of having moving parts which may be deliberately tampered with. From World War II onward, they were widely used in the U.S. for new work until the last fifteen to twenty years when vandalism began to render them vulnerable to <b>false</b> <b>indications.</b>|$|R
50|$|Colour {{light signals}} {{come in two}} forms; both were {{developed}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 20th century in the U.S. The most prevalent form is the multi-unit type, with separate lights and lenses for each colour, in the manner of a traffic light. Hoods and shields are generally provided to shade the lights from sunlight which could cause false indications; coloured Fresnel lenses are used to focus the beam, though reflectors are often not used, to prevent <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> from reflected sunlight. The lights may be mounted vertically or in a triangle; usually green is on top and red at the bottom. Signals with more than three aspects to display generally have multiple heads to display combinations of colours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} irregular operation of the block apparatus by the signalman at Barnes Junction. The signals were interlocked {{so that they could}} not be freed to show clear unless the block ahead was clear. A manual release key could be used to circumvent this interlocking if, for example, a broken mechanical link or track circuit gave a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> of a train on the line. The signalman for Point Pleasant, the block behind Barnes, offered the passenger train forward improperly, without waiting for the [...] "Train out of section" [...] acknowledgement from Barnes. The Barnes signalman had forgotten about the freight train and used his release key to clear the signals.|$|E

The aircraft was destroyed in the crash killing 27 of 34 on board. The cause was attributed to a fault with the horizon direction indicator giving the pilot a <b>false</b> <b>indication</b> and therefore leading him to put the aircraft in the wrong attitude. BEA and their underwriters began action in 1969 against the manufacturer of the indicator. The manufacturer stated they would defend the action and show that the cause was the pilot suffering {{a heart attack and}} the crew being negligent with flightdeck procedures.|$|E
40|$|The {{condition}} of an interface through which an ultrasonic wave passes as it enters a material {{is an important}} factor in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. Most modeling studies of ultrasonic inspection assume that this interface is smooth. However, in real life this may not be the case. In the case of nuclear reactor components, factors such as weld overlay, claddings, grinding and diametrical shrink can give part surfaces a wavy, corrugated or abruptly stepped topography. M. S. Good [1] has provided some estimate of what surface conditions exist in nuclear reactor components, with some examples being illustrated in Fig. 1. These irregular surfaces can severely distort or redirect the ultrasonic beam, leading to <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> of size and location of defects...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research developed and presented in this document was to statistically assess turbulence hazard detection performance employing airborne pulse Doppler radar systems. The FAA certification methodology for forward looking airborne turbulence radars will require estimating the probabilities of missed and <b>false</b> hazard <b>indications</b> under operational conditions. Analytical approaches must {{be used due to}} the near impossibility of obtaining sufficient statistics experimentally. This report describes an end-to-end analytical technique for estimating these probabilities for Enhanced Turbulence (E-Turb) Radar systems under noise-limited conditions, for a variety of aircraft types, as defined in FAA TSO-C 134. This technique provides for one means, but not the only means, by which an applicant can demonstrate compliance to the FAA directed ATDS Working Group performance requirements. Turbulence hazard algorithms were developed that derived predictive estimates of aircraft hazards from basic radar observables. These algorithms were designed to prevent <b>false</b> turbulence <b>indications</b> while accurately predicting areas of elevated turbulence risks to aircraft, passengers, and crew; and were successfully flight tested on a NASA B 757 - 200 and a Delta Air Lines B 737 - 800. Application of this defined methodology for calculating the probability of missed and <b>false</b> hazard <b>indications</b> taking into account the effect of the various algorithms used, is demonstrated for representative transport aircraft and radar performance characteristics...|$|R
3000|$|Few sets of {{kinetic data}} for the {{individual}} reduction steps have been previously reported. While some values have been reported for mixed culture (Additional file 1 : Tables S 3 –S 5), very few studies have assessed pure culture kinetics values. While environmental systems typically are based on mixed cultures, such mixed cultures are not reproducible and may give <b>false</b> <b>indications</b> of the mechanisms and regulation of denitrification. For example, for a given inoculum, a reduction test for N 2 O typically will {{be different from the}} community for a NO_ 3 ^ - [...] reduction test (Shade et al. 2013). The latter could select for bacteria that reduce NO_ 3 ^ - [...] to NO_ 2 ^ - [...] over denitrifiers, so NO_ 2 ^ - [...] accumulation would be due to microbial selection, not the intrinsic kinetics of a denitrifying system.|$|R
