2500|$|Increased {{attention}} {{toward the}} abdomen, including flank watching (turning of the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the abdomen and/or hind quarters), nipping, biting, or kicking ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Dunross {{laid down}} her pen, and slowly turned her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... “One of the Vice-Presidents,” Mr Verloc breathed out heavily; and the First Secretary of the Embassy {{raised his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
50|$|Stand at Ease (U.S.) This is {{the same}} as Parade Rest, except that {{soldiers}} are expected <b>to</b> turn their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> whoever is addressing them. This {{should not be confused with}} At Ease.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--ho--I like that!" [...] said Troy, {{recovering}} himself. [...] "Why, {{her hair}} has been admired by everybody {{who has seen}} her since she has worn it loose, {{which has not been}} long. It is beautiful hair. People used <b>to</b> turn their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, poor girl!" ...|$|R
60|$|The two blacks <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Tier earnestly; {{then they}} turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other. The idea struck each as bold and novel, but each saw serious {{difficulties}} in it. At length Josh, as became his superior station, took on himself the office of expressing the objections that occurred to his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, {{lifting his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, 'I guess I'll answer {{for my own}} faults, if {{everybody}} else'll answer for theirs.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. She {{was so close}} to him that their hats collided. He was profuse in his apologies.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's wrong?" [...] {{asked the}} animal, {{slightly}} turning his wooden <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the party with one eye, {{which was a}} knot of wood.|$|E
60|$|After one look, {{the hunters}} dashed {{down the hill}} and {{were in the midst of}} the {{astonished}} animals almost before they could raise their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. Now commenced a scene which it is not easy to describe correctly. Each man had selected his own group of animals, so that the whole party was scattered in a moment.|$|R
60|$|The {{three young}} women, who {{appeared}} to be very industrious and comfortable, raised their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, and then went on with their work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window, a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune: RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, without any variation.|$|R
60|$|The men obeyed, and then, for {{the first}} time, did they turn their <b>heads,</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those they had been so vehemently pursuing. The other boat was quite {{half a mile from}} them, and it had again tacked. This last {{occurrence}} induced Spike to pull slowly ahead, in quest of another short passage to cut the fugitives off; but no such opening offered.|$|R
6000|$|Tip {{was bound}} so tightly by the cord {{that he could}} not turn his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you're a wise man,' growled Hugh, {{raising his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{him with a}} frown, 'you'll hold your tongue. I tell you I'm going to sleep.' ...|$|E
60|$|All the caress in {{his eyes}} for the books {{vanished}} as he turned his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, and ere he spoke I knew that I, too, was hated.|$|E
6000|$|The Mule {{turned his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> reproachfully <b>at</b> his old friend, the young girl. [...] "Who can fight against magic?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blaspheme {{not against}} the usages of our city," [...] said Pietro Cennini, much offended. [...] "There are new wits who think they see things more truly because they stand on their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, like {{tumblers}} and mountebanks, instead of keeping the attitude of rational men. Doubtless it makes little difference to Maestro Vaiano's monkeys whether they see our Donatello's statue of Judith with their heads or their tails uppermost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He startled me," [...] {{repeated}} Heyst. She {{noted the}} anxiety in his tone, {{and turned her}} <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him across the table.|$|R
60|$|CONFUCIUS [raising his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him] You {{have decided}} not to believe it now that you realize its inconveniences. That is the English method. It may not work in this case.|$|E
60|$|Bilbil {{was deeply}} vexed {{and would not}} even turn his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his master. To escape from Rinkitink he wandered among {{the ruins of the}} palace, where he came upon Prince Inga.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. He was sitting a little outside the circle--an {{attitude}} typical, perhaps, {{of his position}} there. The change in her tone was slight indeed, but it was sufficient.|$|E
60|$|Had Arthur {{not been}} in quite such a hurry to leave the hotel, he might have seen {{something}} which would have interested him, namely, a very lovely woman--so lovely, indeed, that everybody turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her as she passed, accompanied by another woman clad in a stiff black gown, not at all lovely, and rather ancient, but, for all that, well-favoured and pleasant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> on, being duly convoyed to their room in the hotel by his friend the manager.|$|R
6000|$|Another pause, {{during which}} Maggie looked {{steadily}} {{out of the}} window, till by a great effort she moved her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down <b>at</b> Minny's back again, and said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a bit o' real lace," [...] ses the gal, {{twisting}} her <b>'ead</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the collar; [...] "it cost me one and two-three {{only last}} night." ...|$|R
60|$|The tears {{gathered}} {{in her eyes}} and dropped over her cheeks as she raised her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me affectionately when I said those words. I gently unclasped her arms and led her to George.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He was terrible--relating this to me--this {{tortured}} {{skeleton of}} a man drawn up together with his face over his knees, upon a miserable bed in that wretched hovel, and lifting his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me with malignant triumph.|$|E
60|$|Straight at Pomona {{came the}} great black beast, barking furiously. But the girl did not move; {{she did not}} even turn her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dog, who stopped before he reached her and began to rush wildly around her, barking terribly.|$|E
60|$|It {{was curious}} to {{contrast}} the lazy indifference of the attorneys’ clerks who {{were making a}} search for some legal purpose, with the air of earnestness and interest which distinguished the strangers to the place, who were looking up the will of some deceased relative; the former pausing {{every now and then}} with an impatient yawn, or raising their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the people who passed up and down the room; the latter stooping over the book, and running down column after column of names in the deepest abstraction.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do you suppose}}," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ground, {{and then}} {{throwing}} his <b>head</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling,--"what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?" ...|$|R
60|$|With this {{he raised}} his lean <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up <b>at</b> the Tin Owl and the Canary and the Monkey, and he lashed his tail upon the ground and growled as {{fiercely}} as any jaguar could.|$|R
60|$|For Columbine, {{the most}} {{interesting}} moment of this incident was when the mustang raised his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his legs, {{in order to see}} what had been done to them. There was something almost human in that look. It expressed intelligence and fear and fury.|$|E
60|$|And for {{the first}} time he lifted his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me with wonder and incredulity. He lifted his head so sharply that there could be no mistake. I had touched a spring. I saw the whole extent of my opportunity, and could hardly believe in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Toller {{knows it}} already," [...] I said. [...] "No honest man would touch your master {{if he could}} help it. I warn him to go; and I make him {{understand}} me by a sign." [...] I pointed down the stairs, and turned my <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley did {{not even}} turn his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> round <b>at</b> him. [...] "Keep your money!" [...] he said, as he plunged forward through the snow. [...] "I wouldn't touch a cent of it to save your life." ...|$|R
60|$|He leaned {{a little}} toward her, and Jeanne calmly removed herself {{a little further}} away. She turned her <b>head</b> now <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, as she sat upright upon the sofa, very slim and graceful in her white gown.|$|R
60|$|I bade the Zulus {{tear down}} the curtain and pull {{away some of the}} end boughs, so as to let in more light. Then we {{advanced}} up the place, holding our pistols and spears in readiness. The kneeling women turned their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> us and I saw that they were all young and handsome in their fashion, although fierce-faced. Also I saw their hands go to the knives they wore. I called to them to let these be and come out, and that if they did so they had nothing to fear. But if they understood, they did not heed my words.|$|R
