5000|$|In the end, that's {{what this}} {{election}} is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics <b>of</b> <b>hope?</b> John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here [...] - [...] the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> immigrants setting out for distant shores; the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.

6000|$|... 1. Because it floweth {{not from}} faith and experience, but rather from conceit and presumption. Hope, as I have told you, if it be right, cometh of faith, and is brought forth by experience: but the hope now under {{consideration}} is alone, {{and has no}} right original, and therefore not regarded. It is not the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> God, but the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> man; that is, {{it is not the}} <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> God's working, but the hope that standeth in natural abilities. 'Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth, and thou destroyest the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> man' (Job 14:19). Whatsoever in religious matters is but of a carnal and earthly existence, must be washed away, when the overflowing scourge shall at the end pass over the world (Isa 28:17-19).|$|R
