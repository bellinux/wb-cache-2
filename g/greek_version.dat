5|$|Between his 1820 {{graduation}} and 1821, when {{effects of the}} Wallachian uprising led to the School ceasing its activities, he was kept as Lazăr's assistant teacher, tutoring in arithmetics and geometry. It was during those years that he adopted the surname Heliade (also rendered Heliad, Eliad or Eliade), which, he later explained, was a <b>Greek</b> <b>version</b> of his patronymic, in turn stemming from the Romanian version of Elijah.|$|E
5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 {{inscription}} from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying {{that he was}} already an adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription (Herodianus being the <b>Greek</b> <b>version),</b> meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E
