The framework emphasizes the role {{of supply and demand}} factors and the interaction of market forces and labor market institutions. Recent changes in the US <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> are analyzed in detail to highlight crucial measurement issues that arise in studying <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> changes and to illustrate the operation of the supply-demand-institution framework. The roles of skill-biased technological change, globalization forces, changes in demographics and relative skill supplies, industry labor rents, unions, and the minimum wage {{in the evolution of the}} US <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> are examined. Recent <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> changes are placed in a longer-term historical perspective, and differences and similarities in <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> changes among OECD nations are assessed. ...|$|R

This paper examines {{the extent to which}} <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> have adjusted to remove such distortions during the economic transition using micro-data from the Czech Republic. There is strong evidence that Czech <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> are moving toward patterns in market economies, and the change is led by developments in the private sector and retarded by the sluggish response in state enterprises. At the same time, the establishment of collective bargaining {{does not appear to be}} introducing countervailing distortions into Czech <b>wage</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R

A non-discriminatory <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> should lie somewhere in between. In this paper, following Cotton (1988), we have used the proportion {{of men and women in}} wage employment as weights for calculating the non-discriminatory <b>wage</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|R

One compelling explanation for how occupations relate to the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> is through their task content. We consider the relationships between occupational tasks and the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> directly using unconditional quantile regression methods, examining a broader range of occupational tasks than normally considered. We find that occupational tasks have varied implications for the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> in ways not always consistent with dominant technology-based explanations.

30|$|In {{the block}} 2, the raw wage {{differential}} {{is divided into}} two components: the differences in endowments and the differences in coefficients, using the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> of males as the reference <b>wage</b> <b>structure.</b> We find that the discrimination component (coefficients) is larger than the endowment component in both the rural and urban sectors. This suggests that the wage difference between males and females is largely because of discrimination in the labor market. The differences in endowments account for 33 and 19  percent wage gap in the rural and urban populations, respectively whereas discrimination explains 67 and 81  percent of the total wage differential. The block  3 of the table shows the decomposition results using the females <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> as the reference <b>wage</b> <b>structure.</b> The proportion of wage differential in the rural sector due to endowments is 39  percent and the remaining 61  percent can be attributed to discrimination whereas in the urban sector these figures are 15 and 85 percent, respectively.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we further {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} wage differences in Europe, by decomposing countries’ wage differences across the wage distribution. Unlike previous studies, we analyse the contribution of covariates to the wage decomposition components (<b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> and <b>wage</b> composition) by employing a recent methodology proposed by Firpo et al (2009) and Fortin et al. (2011). We use data from the EU-SILC data base for male workers from 9 European countries.

40|$|The <b>structure</b> of <b>wages</b> narrowed {{considerably}} {{during the}} 1940 's, increased slightly during the 1950 's and 1960 's, and then expanded greatly after 1970. The era of wage stretching {{of the past}} two decades has been a current focus, but we return attention here to the decade that was witness to an extraordinary compression in the <b>wage</b> <b>structure.</b> <b>Wages</b> narrowed by education, job experience, region, and occupation, and compression occurred within these cells as well. For white men, the 90 - 10 differential in the log of wages was 1. 414 in 1940 but 1. 060 in 1950. By 1985 it has risen back to its 1940 level. Thus the recent widening of the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> has returned to it a dispersion characteristic of fifty years ago. We explore various explanations for the rapid compression in the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> during the 1940 's and for its maintenance during the subsequent decade or more. We first assess the hypothesis that the Great Depression left the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> in 1939 more unequal than in the late 1920 's, but we find evidence to the contrary. World War II and the National War Labor Board share some of the credit for the Great Compression. But much belongs to a rapid increase in the demand for unskilled labor at a time when educated labor was greatly increasing in number. These same factors caused the <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> to remain compressed until its expansion during the past two decades. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper investigates {{international}} {{differences in}} wage inequality and skills and whether a compressed wage distribution {{is associated with}} high unemployment across core OECD countries. Wage dispersion and <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> are widely debated among policymakers; compressed <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> is often perceived as an important cause of high unemployment. Firstly, this paper examines differences in wage dispersion across OECD countries and their link to skill dispersion. Some countries that have more compressed (dispersed) <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> simultaneously have more compressed (dispersed) skill structures as well, and skill differences explain part {{of the differences in}} wage dispersion. However, even when accounted for skills, some countries have a more compressed <b>wage</b> <b>structure,</b> most likely caused by labor market institutions. We do not find an effect of wage compression on the labor market performance in the low-skill sector. Based on the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) survey of adult skills for core OECD countries, this paper cannot confirm the skill compression nor wage compression hypotheses. Rather than insisting on the deregulation of labor market institutions and reductions in public welfare policy as the main policy recommendations to achieve higher employment (and higher wage inequality), policymakers should reconsider aggregate demand deficiency and the variation in macroeconomic policies as potential explanations for the employment differences across countries.|$|R
