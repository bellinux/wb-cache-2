25|$|A {{new model}} of the Mac Mini was {{introduced}} on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a unibody aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an HDMI port and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> much anticipated refresh after long two years in October 2014, bringing Haswell CPUs, better graphics, $100 lower price for the base model, while the metal body remained nearly the same. The only change was {{the removal of the}} two holes used to open the case, as the RAM is no longer upgradable because it's now soldered to the logic board; this idea is similar to the Retina MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mid 2014 21.5-inch iMac.|$|E

Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role. Green later said that she got along well with Trier, [...] "but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bit too far ...

500|$|Bungie and Microsoft first showed ODST in a playable form at E3 2009, {{where the}} game's release date and retail {{versions}} were finalized. Bungie initially marketed ODST as a title smaller in scope than previous numbered {{entries in the}} series. When the game's retail versions were announced, however, the game received a standard price of US$60, which Bungie and Microsoft attributed to the game growing beyond the planned scope. [...] "Over the course of development <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lot bigger than we were anticipating," [...] said Bungie's Lars Bakken. [...] "We thought of it more as an expansion and then it grew well beyond that." [...] Creamer explained that since the development platform was stable, [...] "we were able to create {{quite a bit more}} content than we originally thought we would". The game's length increased from original estimates of 3–5hours to 8–10. The discrepancy was not discussed until E3 2009 when Microsoft decided it was a full game. Unlike the post-launch support for Halo 3, ODST does not have downloadable content.|$|E

[...] The Music Journal described the album as [...] "certainly brash, lively and down-to-earth. Thoroughly infectious too."
