50|$|Many <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> and {{hardware}} devices can operate more efficiently on triangles that are grouped into meshes {{than on a}} similar number of triangles that are presented individually. This is typically because computer graphics do operations on the vertices {{at the corners of}} triangles. With individual triangles, the system has to operate on three vertices for every triangle. In a large mesh, there could be eight or more triangles meeting at a single vertex - by processing those vertices just once, it is possible to do a fraction of the work and achieve an identical effect.In many computer graphics applications it is necessary to manage a mesh of triangles. The mesh components are vertices, edges, and triangles. An application might require knowledge of the various connections between the mesh components. These connections can be managed independently of the actual vertex positions. This document describes a simple data structure that is convenient for managing the connections. This is not the only possible data structure. Many other types exist and have support for various queries about meshes.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a data base management system {{used in the}} analysis and synthesis of data from a global experiment investigating dynamics of tropical farm ponds. Data synthesis is directed toward developing comprehensive farm pond management models. The experimental plan includes standardized data collection on physical, chemical and biological variables on 12 or more ponds at each of seven locations in Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia. Field data from each location are compiled on microcomputers at the project sites. Project staff at each site perform routine statistical analyses and presentations of these data sets using statistical and <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> of their choice. Field data are forwarded to a central office for filing on a mainframe computer. More sophisticated data analyses and syntheses (modeling) are done on mainframe computers. The standardized experiment design and centralized data base management system facilitates analyses of observations within ponds, between ponds within locations, and between locations. This design allows identification analysis of both general and site specific considerations over {{a broad range of}} environmental conditions. We propose that aquaculture scientists standardize data collection and management to permit direct comparisons of observations among and between research projects.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a system for}} scripting and editing graphic procedures with graphic representations or "icons. " The icons are small bitmap images that carry with them information about spatial placement, list placement, and pointers to procedures. Icons have been created and connected {{to a series of}} image transformation procedures. Two interactive <b>graphic</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> have been written, one for producing icons and one for scripting with icons. Icons can be created in two ways: (1) making bitmaps from frame buffer images and (2) drawing by grid filling. Scripts can be created in two ways: (1) by storyboa~ding icons or (2) by playing out a sequence of graphics and recording the list of events. Scripts can be edited, saved, re-edited, and played upon request. The software takes advantage of the ease with which computers can produce simplified, symmetrical, 1 -bit images and, by its structure, sets examples of iconic interaction. All interaction is done with puck, tablet, menus, and visual cues. Some pre-writing or picture-writing forms are described. A historical overview of computer icons is presented, using several key systems as examples. by Dorothy J. Shamonsky. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|Though cartographic {{production}} {{based on}} geographic information systems has proven benefits, {{a major obstacle}} to the wide acceptance of GIS {{as a tool for}} production cartography has been its inflexibility in allowing cartographers to make changes to the representations of geographic features on a feature by feature basis.

40|$|International audienceWe present here a new {{development}} of the TomoRebuild <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> to perform quantitative Particle Induced X-ray Emission Tomography (PIXET) reconstruction. X-ray yields are obtained from the GUPIX code. The GUPIX data base is available for protons up to 5 MeV {{and also in the}} 20 – 100 MeV energy range, deuterons up to 6 MeV, 3 He and alphas up to 12 MeV. In this version, X-ray yields are calculated for thin samples, i. e. without simulating X-ray attenuation. PIXET data reconstruction is kept as long as possible independent from Scanning Transmission Ion Microscopy Tomography (STIMT). In this way, the local mass distribution (in g/cm 3) of each X-ray emitting element is reconstructed in all voxels of the analyzed volume, only from PIXET data, without the need of associated STIMT data. Only the very last step of data analysis requires STIMT data, in order to normalize PIXET data to obtain concentration distributions, in terms of normalized mass fractions (in μg/g). For this, a noise correction procedure has been designed in ImageJ. Moreover sinogram or image misalignment can be corrected, as well as the difference in beam size between the two experiments. The main features of the TomoRebuild code, user friendly design and modular C++ implementation, were kept. The <b>software</b> <b>package</b> is portable and can run on Windows and Linux operating systems. An optional user-friendly graphic interface was designed in Java, as a plugin for the ImageJ <b>graphic</b> <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> Reconstruction examples are presented from biological specimens of Caenorhabditis elegans – a small nematode constituting a reference model for biology studies.

40|$|For {{a little}} over a decade, {{software}} has been created which allows for the design of visual content by aesthetic evolutionary design (AED). The great majority of these AED systems involve custom software intended for breeding entities within one fairly narrow problem domain, e. g., certain classes of buildings, cars, images, etc. Only a very few generic AED systems have been attempted, and extending them to a new design problem domain can require a significant amount of custom software development. High-end computer <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> have in recent years become sufficiently robust to allow for flexible specification and construction of high-level procedural models. These packages also provide extensibility, allowing for the creation of new software tools. One component of these systems that enables rapid development of new generative models and tools is the visual data flow network. One of the first CG packages to employ this paradigm was Houdini. A system constructed within Houdini that allows for very fast generic specification of evolvable parametric prototypes is described. The real-time nature of the software, when combined with the interlocking data networks, allows not only for vertical ancestor/child populations within the design space to be explored, but also allows for fast horizontal exploration of the potential population surface.
