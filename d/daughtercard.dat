5000|$|A {{large number}} of Sound Blaster 16 cards have a flawed digital sound {{processor}} on board that causes various issues with MIDI <b>daughtercards</b> attached to the Wave Blaster header. The problems include stuck notes, incorrect notes, and various other flaws in MIDI playback. The particular Sound Blaster 16 cards that are affected carry DSP versions 4.11, 4.12 and some 4.13. Older DSP versions such as 4.05 do not suffer from this bug. There is no workaround for this flaw and it occurs with all operating systems since {{it is an issue}} at the hardware level. The DSP version can be checked by running the [...] "DIAGNOSE" [...] utility in DOS or looking at the DSP chip on the sound card. A version number is printed on the CT1740A chip usually near the CT1745A mixer chip.|$|R
5000|$|Rio - The RIO was a 'wavetable' <b>daughtercard</b> MIDI {{synthesizer}} (sample-based synthesizer) {{that was}} {{compatible with the}} Sound Blaster <b>daughtercard</b> pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.|$|E

40|$|A {{new digital}} {{technology}} to implement beam control systems was {{tested in the}} PS Booster in 2004 and 2005 and commissioned in LEIR in 2006. The technology is based upon RF custom hardware that heavily exploits Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) processing power. This architecture is extremely flexible in that it relies on a DSP-carrier board hosting one DSP and carrying different <b>daughtercards.</b> The LEIR beam control system deploys three DSP-carrier boards, which inter-communicate and exchange data continuously {{for the implementation of}} the various beam control loops. This user's manual for the DSP-carrier board, release 1. 0 (EDA- 00990 -V 1), was written in 2004 and has been used by CERN and BNL developers since then. It describes the DSP-carrier board hardware, user settings and FPGA software; hints on the DSP code used with the board are also given. An additional VME board, called Rear Transition Module, is described because it acts as a DSP-carrier board extension...|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} hereby {{presented}} on system embedded photonic interconnect technologies, which would address the communications bottleneck in modern exascale data centre systems driven by exponentially rising consumption of digital {{information and the}} associated complexity of intra-data centre network management along with dwindling data storage capacities. It is proposed that this bottleneck be addressed by adopting within the system electro-optical printed circuit boards (OPCBs), on which conventional electrical layers provide power distribution and static or low speed signaling, but high speed signals are conveyed by optical channels on separate embedded optical layers. One crucial prerequisite towards adopting OPCBs in modern data storage and switch systems is a reliable method of optically connecting peripheral cards and devices within the system to an OPCB backplane or motherboard in a pluggable manner. However the large mechanical misalignment tolerances between connecting cards and devices inherent to such systems are contrasted by the small sizes of optical waveguides required to support optical communication at the speeds defined by prevailing communication protocols. An innovative approach is therefore required to decouple the contrasting mechanical tolerances in the electrical and optical domains in the system in order to enable reliable pluggable optical connectivity. This thesis presents the design, development and characterisation of a suite of new optical waveguide connector interface solutions for electro-optical printed circuit boards (OPCBs) based on embedded planar polymer waveguides and planar glass waveguides. The technologies described include waveguide receptacles allowing parallel fibre connectors to be connected directly to OPCB embedded planar waveguides and board-to-board connectors with embedded parallel optical transceivers allowing <b>daughtercards</b> to be orthogonally connected to an OPCB backplane. For OPCBs based on embedded planar polymer waveguides and embedded planar glass waveguides, a complete demonstration platform was designed and developed to evaluate the connector interfaces and the associated embedded optical interconnect. Furthermore a large portfolio of intellectual property comprising 19 patents and patent applications was generated {{during the course of}} this study, spanning the field of OPCBs, optical waveguides, optical connectors, optical assembly and system embedded optical interconnects...|$|R
5000|$|A daughterboard, <b>daughtercard,</b> {{mezzanine}} board or piggyback board is an expansion card that attaches {{to a system}} directly.

50|$|The Power Mac G3, {{as well as}} {{the very}} first Power Mac G4, had a {{socketed}} processor which could be upgraded. From then on, the Power Macs had their processor(s) on a <b>daughtercard.</b> All other Macs, including the Mac mini, most iMacs, and all of Apple's notebooks, have the processor permanently soldered to the logic board.

The motherboard and <b>daughtercard</b> were housed in an off-the-shelf commercial small form-factor PC case with internal +12/+5VDC auto ranging power supply.|$|E
50|$|PPG's Wave series {{represents}} an evolution of its predecessor by combining its digital sound engine with analog VCAs and 24db per octave VCFs, featuring 8-voice polyphony; and by replacing its nontraditional series of push buttons and sliders with a control panel consisting of an LCD {{and a more}} familiar arrangement of knobs. Also added to the Wave series was an onboard sequencer {{that is capable of}} recording filtering and wavetable changes in realtime. At the core of the Wave's processing unit is a Motorola 6809 CPU, and a variety of 6500 and 6800-series support ICs. MIDI support was added in 1984, via a 6840/6850 <b>daughtercard.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 7300 {{uses the}} same [...] "Outrigger" [...] case as its predecessors, but {{features}} an enhanced PowerPC 604e CPU. However, it no longer came with the video in capability the 7600 had, which possibly accounts {{for the fact that}} this is the only time that Apple used a lower model number for an upgraded model. Apart from that, the 7300 is more closely related to the 7600 than to the 7200, with features such as a processor <b>daughtercard</b> and interleaved RAM. The 7300/180 model was also available in a [...] "PC compatible" [...] configuration that included a 166 MHz Pentium processor with its own RAM (up to 64 MiB) on a PCI card which also provided a PC game port.|$|E
5000|$|The Power Macintosh 7500 {{is one of}} {{the first}} PCI capable Macs {{manufactured}} by Apple Computer. It was released alongside the Power Macintosh 7200, and the Power Macintosh 8500 in October 1995.

The 7500 and 7200 featured a unique swing open chassis termed [...] "Outrigger" [...] by Mac enthusiasts. The entire motherboard was accessible to the user after the hinged drive sleds were opened, allowing for easy upgrades.|$|E
50|$|During the NV1's release timeframe, the {{transition}} from VLB/ISA (486s) to PCI (Pentiums and late model 486 boards) was taking place, and games often used MIDI for music because PCs were still generally incapable of large-scale digital audio playback due to storage and processing power limitations. Reaching for the best music and sound quality, and flexibility with MS-DOS audio standards, often required 2 sound cards be used, or a sound card with a MIDI <b>daughtercard</b> connector. Additionally, NV1's 2D speed and quality were not competitive {{with many of the}} high-end systems available at the time, especially the then-critical-for-games DOS graphics speed. Many consumers were simply not interested in replacing their often-elaborate system setups with an expensive all-in-one board and so the heavy integration of NV1 hurt sales simply through inconvenience.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the ATX-format AmigaOne SE and XE was that the AmigaOne SE had a soldered-on 600 MHz PowerPC 750CXe processor, whereas the AmigaOne XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard. While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the Apple Power Mac G4 CPU <b>daughtercard</b> connector, it is not electrically compatible. There were G3 and G4 options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz. The G4 module originally used a Freescale 7451 processor which was later changed to a Freescale 7455, both without level 3 cache. The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines. Consequently, the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz. In 2007 Acube offered 1.267 GHz 7457. The Micro-A1 was announced in two configurations, under the Micro-A1 I (Industrial) and Micro-A1 C (Consumer) labels. Only the C configuration was produced.|$|E
5000|$|The card's layout {{is quite}} similar to the Soundscape S-2000, and uses the same {{synthesizer}} chips and codecs. Changes include a revision of the 2 MiB patch ROM equipped with new sounds, {{and the addition of}} a powerful digital signal processor (DSP) <b>daughtercard.</b> This DSP, called the Ensoniq Signal Processor (ESP), allows popular enhancement effects to be applied to the Elite's patch sounds. The ESP was used on Ensoniq's musical instruments as well, such as their ASR samplers, TS synthesizers, and the DP Series effects processors. The most popular effects used are reverb and chorus, which are enabled by default on the card. The ESP is also fully configurable through a Windows utility (the [...] "ENSONIQ Effects Tool Kit") and through standard sysex commands which can be issued in various ways (i.e. DOS utilities). Unfortunately the Effects Tool Kit never progressed beyond the beta development stage and is, as a result, not entirely stable or functional.|$|E
5000|$|The Power Macintosh 8500 (the 120 MHz {{model is}} also known as Power Macintosh 8515 in Europe and Japan) is a model of Macintosh {{personal}} computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from 1995 until 1997. Billed as a high-end graphics computer, the Power Macintosh 8500 was the first Macintosh to ship with a replaceable <b>daughtercard.</b> Though slower than the 132 MHz Power Macintosh 9500, the first-generation 8500 featured several audio and video (S-Video and composite video) in/out ports not found in the 9500. In fact, the 8500 incorporated near-broadcast quality (640Ã—480) A/V input and output and was the first personal computer to do so, but no hard drive manufactured in 1997 could sustain the 18 MB/s data rate required to capture video at that resolution. Later, special [...] "AV" [...] hard drives were made available that could delay thermal recalibration until after a write operation had completed. With special care to minimize fragmentation, these drives were able {{to keep up with the}} 8500's video circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|The faster models (not the 300 MHz model) {{used the}} new copper-based PowerPC G3 CPUs made by IBM, which used about 25% {{of the power}} of the Motorola {{versions}} clock for clock. The B&W line ranged from 300 to 450 MHz. Despite its 100 MHz system bus and PC100 SDRAM, the 300 MHz B&W G3 performed worse than its 300 MHz Beige predecessor, because it had only 512 KB L2 cache, half of what the 300 MHz Beige had. The logic board had four PCI slots: three 64-bit 33 MHz slots, and one 32-bit 66 MHz slot dedicated for the graphics card, an ATI Rage 128 with 16 MB SGRAM. Four 100 MHz RAM slots accepted PC100 SDRAM modules, allowing the installation of up to 1 GB of RAM with the use of 256 MB DIMMs. The onboard ATA was upgraded to Ultra ATA/33 (in fact an extra UDMA-33 controller was added, see above), but SCSI was no longer present, having been replaced by two FireWire ports, a new standard (IEEE1394) running at 400 Mbit/s (50 MB/s) â€” faster in theory than even the ATA/33 (33 MB/s) hard drive controller. The serial ports were gone, too, having given way to two USB 1.1 ports (12 Mbit/s), as implemented already in the iMac. The ADB port remained, as did the option for an internal modem. Also gone was the internal floppy disk drive. 100BASE-TX Ethernet was now standard, and audio was moved back to the logic board. A Zip Drive remained an option, and some configurations included a DVD-ROM drive and a DVD-Video decoder <b>daughtercard</b> for the graphics card, allowing hardware-assisted DVD video playback.|$|E
