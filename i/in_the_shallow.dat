5|$|The Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, was ill so {{the design}} of this ship was {{entrusted}} to his assistant and brother-in-law, Nathaniel Barnaby, himself a future Chief Constructor. For reasons that have not survived, the Admiralty required that Penelope to be a ship of unusually shallow draught, possibly {{in light of the}} operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> Baltic Sea during the Crimean War of 1854–55.|$|E
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>the</b> simulated result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region {{may not be}} well guaranteed. Furthermore, the modeled fault does not reach the free surface. These factors result in an underestimation of <b>the</b> final slips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region compared to the inversion results. However, we point out that a significant effect from <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is not required for the multi-event generation.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the stress state is very different between <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> and deeper regions. Though <b>the</b> initial stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is barely above the dynamic strength, the reflected waves inside the front wedge induce a high transient stress drop and large final slip, but no significant overshoot is found. Based on the consistency of our result and the observations, we infer that <b>the</b> initial stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is very low compared to the static strength. Thus, {{it would be difficult to}} nucleate an earthquake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region, but <b>the</b> final slip will always be amplified once the rupture propagates through. This behavior should naturally exist in shallow subduction events. A lower initial stress (e.g. equal to the dynamic strength) still allows the rupture to break up to the trench, but leads to a small final slip (< 50 m) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region.|$|R

5|$|All three ships had {{extensive}} careers during World War II. Maryland and West Virginia were both present during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Maryland escaped relatively unscathed; West Virginia was sunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters of the harbor but subsequently raised and repaired. All three ships served as artillery support ships during amphibious operations. Maryland and West Virginia were present at the last surface action between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. The three ships, put into the reserve fleet {{after the end of}} the war, were scrapped by the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers drowned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> river, {{making it one}} of the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it was hard to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{reason why}} these ships were ordered was for local coast defence {{during the war}} scare during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but they were chosen for several other reasons. They were small and cheap, and their shallow draft was thought to limit them to defensive operations, which appealed to economy and defence-minded Members of Parliament. The Admiralty, however, envisioned them attacking shallow-water ports that larger ironclads could not enter and operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E

5|$|Helmut Lent {{was ordered}} to {{intercept}} and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at Jever from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed. The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> sea off Borkum. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum. Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after {{it had already been}} badly damaged and was about to crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot Carl-August Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; {{the fact that the}} peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.|$|E

5|$|Jaguar, Léopard and Panthère were {{assigned}} to the Northern Command (Forces maritimes du Nord) on 7 September in anticipation of a German invasion of Belgium. They proved, however, to be too large and unmaneuverable for operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters of the English Channel and North Sea; Panthère ran aground on 10 September in poor visibility, but suffered only minor damage, and Jaguar did the same thing on the night of 28/29 October. The contre-torpilleurs were relieved by smaller torpilleurs d'escadre beginning in mid-October. The other ships {{were assigned}} to the Western Command (Forces maritimes de l'Ouest) for convoy escort duties from October 1939 to May 1940 where they guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca, French Morocco, and Le Verdon-sur-Mer. They were joined by the first three ships as they were replaced in the Northern Command. Jaguar was badly damaged during a collision with a British destroyer in January 1940 and her repairs were not completed until early May.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} ranges {{along the western}} coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E
