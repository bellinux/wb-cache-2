40|$|The Cicerone Project {{consists}} of 3 farmlets each with management systems contrasting in inputs (levels of fertilisers and pastures) and grazing management. Farmlet A has high input, high stocking rate, with flexible grazing using the Prograze principles. Farmlet B has moderate input, moderate stocking rate {{with the same}} grazing management as Farmlet A. Farmlet C has moderate inputs and aims at high stocking density using intensive rotational grazing.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop the breeding method of anther culture for pure line induction in Iranian Rice cultivars. Several aspects were studied: the genotype factors, the culture medium, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> and the kind and content of sugar in culture medium. Results showed that the first <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> (middle July) had better callus induction than the second one and has led to increased callus induction of cultivars to 8. 1 percent. In the investigation of carbon source, callus induction medium with 4 % maltose was significantly better than others of sugar treatments. Also, different treatments of sugar had positive effects on cultivars regeneration, but there were not significant. Results indicated that there were significant differences in callus production among the different cultivars, and the average of callus induction ability ranged from 2. 13 % to 23. 38 %. Rashti had the highest callus induction and Amol 3 and Amol 2 had the lowest callus induction. Reciprocal effects of genotype and medium were significant (p< 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} agrochemical used for faming in the Galma Dam area {{on the quality of}} water in the reservoir and well water around the reservoir. Nine <b>sampling</b> points upstream <b>of</b> the Galma Dam were randomly se- lected for the study. Also, six hand dug wells in use by adjacent communities were identified for ground water samples. The study covered the period July to September 2011. All measurements were in accordance with the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. The parameters measured and their mean concentrations from the reser- voir are in the order of: Chlorides (0. 600 - 0. 900 mg/l); Nitrates (0. 009 - 0. 019 mg/l); Bicarbonates; 0. 444 - 1. 900 mg/l); Total Phosphates (0. 173 - 3. 077 mg/l); Sulphates (0. 617 - 3. 587 mg/l); and pH (6. 4 - 7. 5). For the well water samples, the results ranged from 1. 58 - 3. 10 mg/l; 0. 14 - 0. 03 mg/l; 0. 60 - 2. 73 mg/l; 0. 08 - 1. 89 mg/l; 0. 33 - 2. 66 mg/l and 6. 05 - 7. 0 respectively in the order previously listed. The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA at 95 % confidence level. Chlorides showed no significant variation between sampling points but significant variation with <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> sam- pling for surface and well waters. Nitrates variations with both <b>sampling</b> points and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> were insignificant. Bicarbonates variations with <b>sampling</b> points and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> were highly significant.

A single compost windrow was laid on a 6, 000 jersey cow dairy farm located in Madera County. Samples were obtained from six separate positions on the pile, every other day. Direct pile measurements on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> included pile temperature (surface and core), height, width and curvature. Samples were removed from the windrow during each sampling meeting to determine the percent dry matter content. The collected samples were sent out to Denele Analytical Inc. to determine bi-weekly carbon to nitrogen ratios on pile positions one, three and six, both surface and core. Factors such as rotation frequency, wind speed, outside temperature, humidity and rain were noted on all sample dates. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS GLMSELECT procedure to identify the significant factors in the reduction of carbon to nitrogen ratio. Fifteen independent variables/factors were run through SAS and four independent variables were found to impact the composting process. Pile area, temperature at the pile core, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> and wind speed were the factors that changed the dependent variable of carbon to nitrogen ratio.

40|$|Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or {{sleeping}} sickness {{is a major}} public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and {{is due to the}} kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West and Central Africa. The exact role of multiple infections, the basis of clinical diversity observed in patients and the determinism that leads trypanosomes into different body fluids of the host remain opened questions to date. In this paper we investigate, in three Guinean foci, whether strains found in blood, lymph or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or in patients at different phase of HAT (phase 1, early phase 2 and late phase 2) are representative of the focus they belong to. Amplifications of parasites directly from body fluids led to substantial amounts of allelic drop outs, especially so for blood and CSF samples, which required data recoding of all homozygous sites into missing data. While controlling for geography, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> and patient's phase of the disease, we found no effect of body fluids in the genetic structure of T. b. gambiense despite the presence of mixed infections. On the contrary, we found that the strains found in patients in different phase of the disease differed genetically, with early phase patients being more likely to be infected with more recent strains than patients at a more advanced phase of the disease. Thus, the combination of <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> and patient's status represents a parameter to be controlled for in population genetic structure analyses.
