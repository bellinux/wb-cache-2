She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E

500|$|After {{his girlfriend}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) sues her former {{employer}} Dunder Mifflin for wrongful termination, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself forced by Jan to {{be a witness}} against his employer. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{wants to make sure}} Michael will not say anything to harm Dunder Mifflin even though Michael is Jan's boyfriend. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> screwed by your company, but you never <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> screwed by your girlfriend." [...] Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day.|$|E

Ross was taken aback by the criticism, telling New York's Village Voice that he [...] "definitely didn't <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> resistance from left-wing political activists".

500|$|Tilak Ram Tharu was {{the sole}} male {{competitor}} in athletics to represent Nepal at the London Olympic Games. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Tharu qualified for the Games by using a wildcard because his fastest time of eleven seconds at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was 0.76 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. He {{said that he did}} not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the chance {{to take part in the}} Olympic Games and set himself the objective of recording a new Nepalese national record. Tharu spent two months training in Nepal alongside his period in Kent. He was drawn in the event's fourth heat in the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fifth out of eight athletes, with a time of 10.85 seconds. Tharu ranked ahead of Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) and Nooa Takooa of Kiribati (11.53 seconds) but behind Malta's Rachid Chouhal (10.83 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall he finished 59th out of 75 competitors overall, and did not advance to the later stages because he was 0.23 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who progressed to the first round. Tharu was unable to achieve his Nepalese national record goal but stated his time improvement was positive although he felt Nepal required better training facilities.|$|E
