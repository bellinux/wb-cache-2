5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing <b>digital</b> <b>data.</b> With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E

Here we suggest a criterion for determining the appropriate drainage density at which to extract networks from <b>digital</b> elevation <b>data.</b> The criterion is basically to extract the highest resolution (highest drainage density) network that satisfies scaling laws that have traditionally been found to hold for channel networks. Procedures that use this criterion are presented and tested on 21 <b>digital</b> elevation <b>data</b> sets well distributed throughout the U. S...|$|R

25|$|New Media as <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> Controlled by Software The {{language}} of New Media {{is based on}} the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Authentication {{and control}} of <b>digital</b> cartographic <b>data</b> has {{recently}} {{become a matter of}} great interest as vast digital geo-libraries and spatial data collections become available to the public through the Internet. The significant monetary value of <b>digital</b> cartographic <b>data</b> is undisputed, as it comprises and important part of a growing $ 10, 000, 000, 000 (US) geo-spatial information technology sector. While this high-value cartographic data continues to become available, pressure grows for a comprehensive review and formulation of an intellectual property rights management system for <b>digital</b> spatial <b>data</b> a system that assures some protection for data producers and data owners and encourages sharing of data {{for the benefit of the}} public commons. This paper briefly discusses some of the conceptual issues relevant to intellectual property rights management systems for <b>digital</b> spatial <b>data,</b> namely, authentication, characterization, and control methods...|$|R

Initial results indicate that satellite-based estimates of thunderstorm updraft intensity are related to storm precipitation rate as indicated in the <b>digital</b> radar <b>data.</b> The conclusions give support to the effort to use satellite data for detection of heavy convective precipitation, but emphasize the need for high time resolution (5 min) data...|$|R

Information Systems researchers have not been slow to embrace this combination of method and data. Such systems increasingly provide “digital trace data ” that provide new research opportunities. Yet <b>digital</b> trace <b>data</b> are substantively different from the survey and interview data for which network analysis measures and interpretations were originally developed.
