60|$|So Frank {{went down}} into the darkening room below, and {{mechanically}} lighting his pipe, he sat with his elbows upon his knees and stared out into the gathering gloom where one bright evening star twinkled in a violet sky. The <b>gentle</b> <b>hush</b> of the gloaming was around him, and some late bird was calling outside amongst the laurels. Above he heard the shuffling of feet, the murmur of voices, and then amid it all those thin glutinous cries, HIS voice, the voice of this new man with all a man's possibilities for good and for evil, who had taken up his dwelling with them. And as he listened to those cries, a gentle sadness was mixed with his joy, for he felt that things were now for ever changed--that whatever sweet harmonies of life might still be awaiting him, from this hour onwards, they might form themselves into the subtlest and loveliest of chords, but it must always be as a trio, and never as the dear duet of the past.|$|E
60|$|The Temple form of shyness {{seemed to}} consist in {{ignoring}} strangers, but being neither abashed nor silenced, only resenting or avoiding all attempts at intercourse, and as the boys rushed {{in and out of}} the rooms, exploring, exclaiming, and calling mamma, to the interruption of all that was going on, only checked for a few minutes by her uplifted hand and <b>gentle</b> <b>hush,</b> Grace saw her mother so stunned and bewildered that she rejoiced in the fear of cold that had decided that Rachel alone should spend the evening there. Fanny made some excuses; she longed to see more of her aunt, but when they were a little more settled,--and as a fresh shout broke out, she was afraid they were rather unruly,--she must come and talk to her at the dear Homestead. So kind of Rachel to stay--not that the boys seemed to think so, as they went racing in and out, stretching their ship-bound legs, and taking possession of the minute shrubbery, which they scorned for the want of gum-trees and parrots.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Soone as the Elfin {{knight in}} {{presence}} came And false Duessa, seeming ladye fayre, A <b>gentle</b> <b>husher,</b> Vanitie by name, Made roome, and passage did for them prepare.' ...|$|R
60|$|Kate was {{a little}} afraid he would make his {{teaching}} turn on submitting to rulers; it was an Epistle {{that would have given}} him a good opportunity, for it was the Fourth Epiphany Sunday, brought in {{at the end of the}} Sundays after Trinity. If he made his teaching personal, something within her wondered if she could bear it, and was ready to turn angry and defiant. But no such thing; what he talked to them about was the <b>gentle</b> Presence that <b>hushed</b> the waves and winds in outward nature, and calmed the wild spiritual torments of the possessed; and how all fears and terrors, all foolish fancies and passionate tempers, will be softened into peace when the thought of Him rises in the heart.|$|R
