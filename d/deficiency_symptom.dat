40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} patient-reported outcome (PRO) scale for {{patients}} with stable {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (sCOPD) and to study its clinical applicability in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: According to standardized procedures, the test version of PRO scale for sCOPD (sCOPD-PRO scale) was developed based on the theory of “unity of body and spirit” and was used to test 324 patients selected from six clinical centers. Five methods were used to analyze the items; the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the remaining items of the scale were evaluated. Results: (1) sCOPD-PRO consisted of 23 items after item analysis, and according to the content of each item, these items could be grouped into four domains, namely, lung and kidney <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptom,</b> spleen <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptom,</b> functional activities and emotional impact. (2) Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for sCOPD-PRO scale was more than 0. 75 in four domains and total scores. (3) sCOPD-PRO scale and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were moderately correlated or highly correlated in corresponding domains: the correlation coefficient between the total score of sCOPD-PRO scale and the total score of SGRQ was 0. 72 (P< 0. 01), the correlation coefficient between functional activities domain of sCOPD-PRO scale and activity domain of SGRQ was 0. 77 (P< 0. 01), and the correlation coefficient between emotional impact domain of sCOPD-PRO scale and impact domain of SGRQ was 0. 51 (P< 0. 01).

The progenitor species have high genetic diversity compared with the cultivated genotypes; therefore, the use of wild relative in F. chiloensis breeding could provide a good for broadening the available genetic variations of cultivated species. In present study, 13 genotypes selected from strawberry super core collection were tested under Fe (-) and Fe (+) conditions for their response against Fe deficiency conditions in a growth medium (GM) (soil + sand + perlite), potentially able to simulate the actual GM in nature. SPAD-meter readings indicating chlorophyll levels of the leaf, shoot dry matter yield, Fe-efficiency rate, shoot total and active Fe concentrations were determined to evaluate the resistance levels of strawberry genotypes against Fe deficiency. Results of this study indicated that different response for strawberry subspecies and genotypes of the same subspecies grown in GM against Fe <b>deficiency.</b> <b>Symptom</b> for Fe deficiency of genotypes varied between 1 - 5, SPAD-meter readings 3, shoot dry matter yields and shoot Fe concentrations varied between 6. 5 - 38, 1. 02 - 6. 06 g plant- 1 and 41. 8 - 233. 1 mg kg- 1 respectively. Iron-efficiencies of genotypes were found between 58 – 98 %. Strawberry subspecies, F. virginiana spp. glauca, F. chiloensis ssp. chiloensis and F. chiloensis ssp. pacifica showed Fe-efficiency values of 93. 8, 79. 5 and 79. 1 % respectively.

Banana passion fruit plants were transplanted to plastic pots, containing a substrate of quartz sand, with irrigation twice a week and fertigation once a week. The evaluated variables were total dry weight (TDW), percentage of dry mass allocation, leaf area (LA), number of leaves (NL), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR). In addition, a photographic record was taken to recognize the symptomatology in the leaves. The absence of N, K and Mg affected the accumulation of DM, whereas the high nutrient level allowed for the greatest gain in DM only with N, while with K and Mg, it was reduced, indicating that these doses may be too excessive. The distribution pattern of DM with the N treatments corresponded to the model proposed by Thornley, accumulating more DM in the root. With the K and Mg levels, the distribution pattern was similar with the absence of these nutrients causing higher DM accumulation in the above-ground plant parts. The leaf variables NL and LA were reduced with all three elements at the zero nutrient level, whereas the high indices of SLA and LAR revealed a low gain of DM.

The objective of this research was to establish standard concentration values of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and B in longkong leaf.

Yield of individual tree was recorded and used for establishment of nutrient standard concentration values by the high-yield-tree method (> 70 kg tree- 1) and theboundary-line method. The results revealed that the sufficient ranges of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and B established by high-yield-tree method were 74 - 88, 81 - 107, 16 - 19, 7 - 9 and 32 - 38 mg kg- 1, respectively and the sufficientranges of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and B estimated by boundary-line method were 61 - 66, 49 - 58, 18 - 20, 7 - 8 and 27 - 30 mg kg- 1, respectively.

40|$|Brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) is a {{temperate}} {{grass that}} has great promise {{as a model}} system to study grass-specific traits for crop improvement. Under iron (Fe) -deficient conditions, grasses synthesize and secrete Fe(III) -chelating agents called phytosiderophores (PS). In maize, Yellow Stripe 1 (ZmYS 1) is the transporter responsible for uptake of Fe(III) -PS complexes from the soil. Some {{members of the family}} of related proteins called Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) have roles in internal Fe translocation of plants, while the function of other members remains uninvestigated. ^ One aim {{of this study was to}} establish brachypodium as a model system to study Fe homeostasis in grasses. HDMA was detected as the dominant type of PS secreted by brachypodium, and its secretion is diurnally regulated in parallel to that of related species such as barley and wheat. Nineteen YSL family members were identified in brachypodium, and their expression profiles in response to Fe deficiency were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some YSLs group into a grass-specific clade, and expression of the BdYSL members of this clade could not be detected in shoots or roots, suggesting grass-specific functions in reproductive tissues. The Fe status of the plant can regulate expression of several BdYSL genes in both shoots and roots suggesting roles in Fe homeostasis. Brachypodium YS 1 knockdown lines were also generated to test Fe(III) -PS transport abilities of certain YSL proteins. ^ In the context of this dissertation, an EMS mutagenized population of brachypodium was produced. One mutant with the iron <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptom</b> interveinal chlorosis was characterized. Metal content analyses revealed that mutant plants are low in Fe, Zn and Cu. Mutant plants are capable of synthesizing PS in normal amounts, but they do not release the PS from roots into the soil solution, suggesting that gene underlying this mutation functions to allow secretion of PS. Performing bulk segregant array mapping and fine mapping using SNP markers, the location of this new mutation was mapped to a 1. 7 Mb interval on chromosome 5. Cloning of this gene is likely to fill in the missing part of the iron uptake mechanism in grasses. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{dynamical}} {{bases of}} the interaction between the plant mineral nutrition and the circadian clock could contribute to improve crop yield and resistance to adverse conditions, such as mineral element deficiencies. Magnesium is an essential element that catalyzes more than six hundred enzymatic reactions and occupies the center of the chlorophyll structure in plants. Physiological targets of magnesium deficiency are generally better described in aerial than in belowground organs. In this thesis, we first characterized the root morphology of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia- 0) in response to magnesium supply during in vitro culture. The length of primary root and the number and length of lateral roots decreased during magnesium depletion. A local magnesium-rich source does not enhance the root foraging capacity, unlike some other major nutrients. Auxin and abscisic acid emerged as two hormones shaping root morphology in response to magnesium deficiency. Second, we investigated the natural variation of the root morphology response to magnesium supply in Arabidopsis. Thirty-six accessions were screened in vitro. Compared to the reference Columbia- 0, some accessions had higher number and length of lateral roots at low magnesium supply. Root or shoot magnesium concentrations did not implicitly correlate with the root morphological traits. However, shoot calcium and root phosphorus concentrations correlated positively with the lateral root number and length, while root iron negatively with the length of primary root. Third, we focused on the interaction between the plant magnesium nutrition and the circadian clock circuit. We tested for a possible involvement of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 -LIKE 1 (PIL 1) - a clock-associated gene that is down-regulated during magnesium depletion - in morphological and physiological responses, and for a circadian connection of PIL 1 in the context of magnesium deficiency. The phenotypes of loss-of-function and overexpression lines did not reveal a major role of PIL 1 in the magnesium <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptom</b> manifestation but rather in the plant mineral profile. The expression of PIL 1 was apparently not under any circadian control. However, PIL 1 seemed to regulate the expressions of some core clock genes (CCA 1, LHY and PRR 9), which were also targets during magnesium deficiency. In conclusion, PIL 1 has a link with the circadian rhythm machinery but it does not emerge as a pivotal regulator of magnesium stress responses.

40|$|In {{experiments}} with rats and Peking ducklings {{it has been}} investigated {{to what extent the}} linoleic acid content of the diet is of influence on the requirement of vitamin E. This requirement was determined by adding D-α-tocopheryl acetate in increasing doses to vitamin E-free diets and to determine how much vitamin E was necessary to prevent deficiency symptoms, such as invitro haemolysis in the rat and myopathy in the duckling. For these symptoms methods were developed with with the deficiency grade could be expressed by a number. The erythrocytes of rats with a vitamin E deficiency haemolyse spontaneously in vitro. Use was made of this phenomenon todetermine the requirement of vitamin E. For this purpose, newly weaned male rats were placed on diets with increasing doses of vitamin E. After 2 weeks the haemolysis test was positive. The test was repeated weekly. Good results were obtained when a 0. 01 % erythrocyte suspension was incubated for 4 hours in a solution of physiological saline buffered with phosphate, at pH 7. 4 and 38 °C. It was found that there was a negatively linear relation between the logarithm of the vitamin E content of the food and the percentage invitro haemolysis. By linear extrapolation it could be calculated how much vitamin E was necessary to prevent haemolysis. This is invitro haemolysis, which cannot in itself be regarded as a <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptom,</b> was found, after prolonged vitamin E deficiency in rats, to show a clear relation with the degree of myopathy of the leg muscles. The experiment with Peking ducklings was started with one-day-old chickens which were kept for 4 weeks on diets with increasing doses of vitamin E. In contrast with rats, in these ducklings the erythrocytes showed invitro only a very slight spontaneous haemolysis. On the other hand, strong myopathy occurred. The strongest was the hyaline-degeneration of theskeletal muscles, Moreover, necrocalcinosis was found in the smooth muscles of stomach and intestines and in the heart muscle. In the duckling, besides the degree of myopathy in the various organs, certain other criteria were investigated for their suitability for determining the requirement of vitamin E: weight increase, differential counting of leucocytes, activity of the serum enzymes creatine-phosphokinase, aspartate-aminotransferase and lactic acid dehydrogenase, differential determination of the serum proteins and the serum tocopherol level, All these criteria showed a clear connection with the vitamin E content of the food. The histologically determined degree of myopathy of the skeletal muscles was found to be the most suitable for the determination of the requirement of vitamin E. The degree of myopathy of a duckling was expressed as a score (0 - 24) which was determined by a microscopic assessment of the cross-sections of three pairs of leg muscles (score 0 - 4 per muscle). A linear relation was found between the myopathy score and the logaritm of the vitamin E content of the food. The amount of vitamin E needed to prevent myopathy could be calculated by linear extrapolation. Myopathy in ducklings was found to occur only if the food contained little vitamin E {{at the same time as}} very little selenium. As little as 0. 1 mg Se (as Na 2 SeO 3 ) per kg food was sufficient to prevent myopathy completely, This amount has an anti-myopathic effect that is equal to at least 20 mg D-α-tocopheryl acetate,All diets, of the rats as well as of the ducklings, contained 35 cal% fat. The linoleic acid content of the diet was varied by the use of fats with a low (lard and coconut fat) or with a high linoleic acid content (maize oil and safflower oil). Lard and coconut fat contain very little vitamin E; in the case of maize oil and safflower oil, the tocopherols were removed. Increasing doses of linoleic acid were obtained by the use of mixtures of coconut fat and safflower oil, Study of the effect of an increasing linoleic acid content of the food led to the following conclusions:- Up to 10 cal% the linoleic acid content of the food has no influence on the requirement of vitamin E. This requirement is roughly 3. 0 mg D-α-tocopherol per 1000 Kcal food. - At a linoleic acid uptake of more than 10 cal% the requirement of vitamin E can increase to 6 mg D-α-tocopherol per 1000 Kcal food, This is probably the result of an increased breakdown of vitamin E in the gastro-intestinal tract. - From the ratio between the content of vitamin E and linoleic acid it is not possible to deduce whether or not a diet contains sufficient vitamin E. - Many investigators have observed an increase in the requirement of vitamin E after only very small doses of linoleic acid. However, they were working with diets which contained insufficient essential fatty acids (EFA). With these diets (0 - 2 cal% linoleic acid) linoleic acid uptake causes a proportional increase in the requirement of vitamin E, which no longer increases once the EFA-deficiency has been corrected. It seems probable that in biomembranes a critical ratio exists between vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acids. - At a fat consumption of 30 - 40 cal% a dietary fat will need to contain 100 mg D-α-tocopherol (or an equivalent amount of other tocopherols) per kg fat to meet the requirement of vitamin E, This requirement can rise to 200 mg, if the fat contains more than 25 % linoleic acid. - In general, vegetable oils with a high linoleic acid content contain ample vitamin E. Strongly saturated fats often contain too little vitamin E...|$|E

If they are expressing <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptoms,</b> then yes they are. However, the reason may not be due to insufficient available nutrients in the soil, but rather poor uptake due to climatic or soil factors affecting growth. This was recently discussed in an ICM News article for potassium (K) in corn and soybean. If the symptoms are clearly present, then {{there really is no}} need for plant sampling and analysis as the plant is indicating the deficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} {{was confirmed}} that the addition of germanium dioxide (soluble form) to the nutrient solution can delay {{for a short time}} the appearance of boron <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptoms</b> on the shoots of sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L.). This appeared to be true, however, only under growing conditions in which the plants had a low boron requirement. The delay in the appearance of boron <b>deficiency</b> <b>symptoms</b> by administering germanium was demonstrated in sunflower plants ranging in age from 7 to 20 days. This effect was noted whether the germanium was administered prior to or at the time the plants were transferred to minus-boron nutrient solution...|$|R
