40|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} {{and utilization}} has been practiced in Malaysia {{especially in the}} villages since long time ago. The 1998 drought, which brought unpleasant water supply disruptions for the Kuala Lumpur folks, has created a surge of interest in rainwater harvesting. This paper looks at the current technology used in rainwater harvesting consists of collection area, gutters, down pipes, <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> <b>system,</b> storage tank and focusing on water quality using the Bio-sand filtration as a treatment system. This system is set up {{at the main campus}} KUiTTHO, Johor, Malaysia. A fine sand medium (d = 0. 45 mm, UC = 2. 7, porosity(e) = 0. 45, density(pp) = 2. 65 g/ml) with 0. 40 m depth was used to determine the effectiveness of the filtration system. Rainwater was collected from 15 storm rainfall events from February 2005 to April 2005. Samplings were taken from the effluent and influent of the system, and analysed for turbidity, total suspended solid, and pH. The results indicated that the Bio-sand filter could remove at maximum level 93 % of turbidity (ranged from 2. 53 - 8. 9 NTU after filtration), 92 % of total suspended solid (3 - 17. 6 mg/L) and 34 % of pH (6. 29 - 6. 86). This study shows that the Bio-sand filter improves the rainwater into a better quality water conform to the WHO Drinking Standard Guidelines and the Interim National River Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (within Class 1 and 2 A) which makes its suitable for a variety of non potable uses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> {{phenomenon}} can {{be defined}} as the initial period during which the concentration of pollutants was higher than those in latter stage of rain events (Gupta and Saul 1996). Researches have shown that diverting the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> from the harvested rainwater may improve the quality of stored water. In this study, a special <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> volume harvesting <b>system</b> has been setup in two houses located in two different areas in the Ile de France (France) and 13 storm events during 8 months have been collected. The results show the correlation between some parameters. Amount them, TSS and turbidity show a clear decline, which have the potential to describe the first-flush effect. Otherwise, {{there was no evidence that}} can prove the existence of such <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> phenomenon in terms of the microbial indicators.

40|$|First-flush {{diversion}} {{is increasingly}} recognised {{as a useful}} intervention to reduce both suspended and dissolved contaminate loads in rainwater <b>systems.</b> Such <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> <b>systems</b> rely on the early rain to wash the roof before water is allowed in the store. While there is almost universal acceptance that this is beneficial, {{there is no agreement}} on just how much water is to be diverted and the reset of the device rarely considered. In a paper delivered at the 12 th IRCSA conference the authors presented a number of field measurements and derived an exponential decay constant for the first-flush phenomenon based on rainfall depth. This paper builds on these results by applying this decay constant, and a time constant for debris accumulation derived from the same data, to a water-balance model. The results show that most current first-flush devices used in the field have a poor performance; however it is possible to remove up to 85 % of incoming material while retaining 85 % of the water if the device is designed carefully. Better material removal performance is possible but only at the expense of lower water yield; similarly water yield can be improved by reducing overall material removal. The key to good performance is found to be to use a slow device reset combined with a large water diversion, though not as large as had been initially feared. A design procedure is discussed along with practical technical constraints, possibilities and currently available techniques...|$|R

40|$|Rainwater can be {{harvested}} from any simple clean roof surface and, if collected properly, requires {{little or no}} treatment before consumption. However, rainwater may become polluted and unhygienic if the dirty <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> is not separated from the clean rainwater especially after a long dry season. Some people do temporarily let the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> run to waste before collecting clean water, {{but this does not}} easily apply for rainwater harvesting systems fixed with permanent collection and storage tanks. This study was set out to exam the problem and came up with pilot devices in prototype, which could be used to improve on the quality of rainwater collected for storage. The prototypes were designed to retain the dirty <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> before letting clean water flow to the main storage tank. The quality of the output rainwater, collected after installation of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> retainer, was analyzed and the overall benefits of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> retainer technology evaluated.

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{knowledge}} in relation to <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> {{does not provide a}} clear understanding of the role of rainfall and catchment characteristics in influencing this phenomenon. This is attributed to the inconsistent findings from research studies due to the unsatisfactory selection of <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> indicators and how <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> is defined. The research study discussed in this thesis provides the outcomes of a comprehensive analysis on the influence of rainfall and catchment characteristics on <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> behaviour in residential catchments. Two sets of <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> indicators are introduced in this study. These indicators were selected such that they are representative in explaining in a systematic manner the characteristics associated with <b>first</b> <b>flush.</b> Stormwater samples and rainfall-runoff data were collected and recorded from stormwater monitoring stations established at three urban catchments at Coomera Waters, Gold Coast, Australia. In addition, historical data were also used to support the data analysis. Three water quality parameters were analysed, namely, total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). The data analyses were primarily undertaken using multi criteria decision making methods, PROMETHEE and GAIA. Based on the data obtained, the pollutant load distribution curve (LV) was determined for the individual rainfall events and pollutant types. Accordingly, two sets of <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> indicators were derived from the curve, namely, cumulative load wash-off for every 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of structural elements employed for stormwater mitigation such as bioretention basins and constructed wetlands {{depend on the}} compatibility between their design specifications and actual stormwater quality and quantity characteristics. These structural elements are commonly designed to accommodate the initial portion of runoff considering the occurrence of <b>first</b> <b>flush.</b> Therefore, the {{effectiveness of}} stormwater quality treatment primarily depends on the in-depth knowledge of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> phenomenon {{and the ability to}} provide appropriate treatment.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of an integrated approach to urban drainage <b>systems,</b> <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> flows management {{is going to become}} one of the primary targets for the protection of receiving water bodies and the related pollution control. It has been demonstrated that, during storm events, the pollutant load associated with <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> flows is sometimes higher than the waste water one in ordinary conditions. However the evaluation of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> runoff volume and the design and optimisation of possible detention tanks and treatment facilities require a deeper understanding of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> phenomenon. In order to investigate runoff pollution and the relationship between pollutant load and runoff, two monitoring systems have been installed in the experimental catchment of Villa Cambiaso, University of Genoa, for sampling separately roof and road runoff. Since January 2002, both water quality and flow measurement data have been collected by analysing the following parameters: total suspended solids, COD, NH 4 +, pH and heavy metals in dissolved form (Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni). Cumulative load curves were produced for all monitored water quality parameters. As for the road runoff, the magnitude of the <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> in the monitored events strongly depends on the duration of the antecedent dry weather period, while the influence of the initial rainfall intensity was observed on the occurrence of the phenomenon. Regarding roof runoff, the entity of <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> of heavy metals in dissolved form is affected by both rainfall event characteristics (intensity and total depth) and environmental conditions prior to the rain event; the occurrence of <b>first</b> <b>flush</b> of suspended solids is mainly affected by the duration of the antecedent dry weather period, which regulates pollutant, building u...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”It is a {{well known}} fact that {{large number of people}} of all age groups travel by train.

Further it affects people by spreading various diseases. One main reason for the lack of cleanliness is that people forget to flush the toilet often. To maintain toilets clean, separate routines are adopted but only periodically at major stations. Hence most of the time, toilet remains unclean. This project aims to design and fabricate the semi automated <b>flushing</b> <b>system</b> in toilets in railway toilets.
