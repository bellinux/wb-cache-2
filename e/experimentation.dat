5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social <b>experimentation,</b> {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual <b>experimentation</b> was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no {{seedings}} were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment {{was not ready to}} be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional <b>experimentation</b> in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E

5|$|Pilot-testing and <b>experimentation</b> {{continued}} {{for three more}} years. An experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969. It was later known as Troop Leader Development; the final Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide, written by John W. Larson, credited White Stag with its origins.|$|E
5|$|Retrospectively, Nimrod {{is noted}} for its musical {{diversity}} and <b>experimentation.</b> It contains elements of folk, surf rock, and ska; the lyrical themes discussed on the record include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.|$|E
40|$|The ever central {{position}} of Thomas Mofolo’s Chaka {{has often been}} justified by the novel’s cultural and thematic contents. This paper rather links this long standing reputation of the narrative to the stylistic and linguistic <b>experimentations</b> initiated by the author. Such <b>experimentations</b> have consisted in fusing languages and aesthetic canons of differing cultural zones...|$|R

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is later found in the desert {{following}} {{the events of the}} second season finale and nursed back to health by Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman). Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic <b>experimentation,</b> discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human <b>experimentation</b> to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E
5|$|Two French-made s were {{commissioned}} in 1928–1929. Both were {{captured by the}} Italians during the April 1941 invasion, after which they were put into service as training and <b>experimentation</b> boats under new names. They were both scuttled {{at the time of}} the Italian capitulation.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 960 sorties {{had been made}} during the trials, {{including}} 1,366 takeoffs and landings, {{by the end of}} evaluations in November 1965. One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation XV-6A Kestrel, and underwent further testing. The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials and <b>experimentation</b> at RAE Bedford with one being modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E
30|$|Sixty Planetlab nodes were {{selected}} {{to be used as}} landmarks. Two <b>experimentations</b> have been carried out, using a landmark simulating a CSP or an Amazon CSP. Reported distance error is 88.5 km in case of simulated CSP and 112.7 km for Amazon CSP. The increase in distance error is due the density of landmarks used in both <b>experimentations.</b> There were less landmarks around Amazon CSP.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player <b>experimentation,</b> such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the <b>experimentation</b> in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Les Chants Magnétiques was {{released}} on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6million units. In its first two months the new album sold a reported 200,000units in France alone. The album uses sounds from the Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was an early pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic <b>experimentation</b> in new ways.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under <b>experimentation.</b>|$|E
5|$|First of the class, Osvetnik was {{involved}} in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period. She was captured in port by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. She was refitted and modernised before being commissioned by the Italians as Francesco Rismondo, but was only used for training and <b>experimentation.</b> After the Italian surrender, she was captured then scuttled by the Germans in September 1943.|$|E
