5|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in New Orleans {{began with the}} {{construction}} of the Hennan Building in 1895; this building, rising , is often regarded as the first skyscraper in New Orleans. The 20-story Hibernia Bank Building, constructed in 1921 at a height of , held the title of the tallest in New Orleans for 44 years. But, for most of the 20th century, the skyline of New Orleans consisted of only low and mid-rise structures. The soft soils of New Orleans are susceptible to subsidence, and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing large high-rises <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the era of}} Ottoman rule, and {{especially}} from the 17th to the 19th century, the local Greek Orthodox communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of Zagori acquired an autonomous status inside the Ottoman Empire, whereby the locals were exempt from the fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities. During this period large groups of villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment,</b> the art of herbal healing by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.|$|E

50|$|Tychyna {{represents}} a complicated figure in both {{a political and}} academic sense. Many Ukrainian exile intellectuals and scholars involved {{in the analysis of}} Ukrainian literary history could not accept Tychnya's submission to political authority and apparent abandonment of many of his literary companions to the horrors of Stalinism. The true merit of his later poetry has been difficult to judge <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bitter <b>environment,</b> which is only now relaxing.

5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment.</b> Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E

25|$|If {{there had}} been doubts over Bernini's {{position}} as Rome's preeminent artist, {{the success of the}} Four Rivers Fountain removed them. Bernini continued to receive commissions from Pope Innocent X and other senior members of Rome's clergy and aristocracy, as well as from exalted patrons outside of Rome, such as Francesco d'Este. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment,</b> Bernini's artistic style flourished. New types of funerary monument were designed, such as the seemingly floating medallion, hovering in the air as it were, for the deceased nun Maria Raggi, while chapels he designed, such as the Raimondi Chapel in the church of San Pietro in Montorio, illustrated how Bernini could use hidden lighting to help suggest divine intervention within the narratives he was depicting.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that [...] "direct government by the Assembly" [...] {{could not survive}} <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment.</b> The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Mustafa Kemal saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both. He prevented the spread into Turkey of the totalitarian party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy. Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies {{as a means of}} eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.|$|E
2500|$|The author Ahmed Rashid {{suggests}} that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology. It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history.

2500|$|To the north, {{the leading}} brigade of the 31st Division {{advanced}} into no man's land before zero hour, ready to rush the German front trench when the barrage lifted. Some {{units of the}} 4th Division, advanced from the British front line in formations led by snipers and skirmishers; in the 29th Division some battalions [...] "marched" [...] to the German wire and others rushed forward from assembly-trenches dug in no man's land. In the 36th, 32nd and 8th division areas, some battalions assembled {{in front of the}} German wire, ready to rush forward at zero hour and many of the battalions of XV Corps and XIII Corps walked slowly forward in lines behind a creeping barrage. Of [...] in the initial attack, [...] into no man's land, ten rushed from the British front trench and twelve advanced at a steady pace behind a barrage. Prior and Wilson found that the behaviour of the British infantry had less effect than the behaviour of the German infantry, which in turn was determined by the fire of the British artillery. Where the German defences and garrisons had been destroyed, the British infantry succeeded. When significant numbers of German machine-gunners survived, especially when supported by artillery, the British attack failed. On the French front, the artillery preparation was almost wholly effective in destroying German defences and killing German infantry in their underground shelters. The prevalence and effectiveness of killing-machines determined the result and <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment,</b> a soldier with a bayonet was obsolete and infantry formations irrelevant.|$|E
