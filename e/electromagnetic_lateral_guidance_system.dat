Given any feasible entry conditions, terminal area energy management interface conditions, and the reference trajectory generated onboard then, the method can generate a longitudinal guidance profile rapidly, featuring linear quadratic regular method and a proportional-integral-derivative tracking law with time-varying gains, which satisfies all the entry corridor constraints and meets the requirements with high precision. Afterwards, by utilizing special features of crossrange parameter, establishing bank-reversal corridor, and determining bank-reversals according to dynamically adjusted method, the algorithm enables the <b>lateral</b> entry <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> to fly a wide range of missions and provides reliable and good performance in the presence of significant aerodynamic modeling uncertainty.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{control of a}} low-speed vehicle. Several topics are studied in detail: (1) vehicle error-state model for <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> based on Ackerman steering and (2) <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle using fuzzy logic. Independently written research papers address each topic. The first paper presents a second order 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 kinematic model based on Ackerman steering appropriate for studying the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of low-speed vehicles traversing on roads of constant curvature. <b>Lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of vehicles is {{of great interest to}} the Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS) Division of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) community. Both linear and nonlinear models are derived in detail. The error states considered are the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s lateral error and heading error measured with respect to the instantaneous road centerline tangent. In addition to the derivation, both simulation and experimental results are presented with very good correspondence being achieved. The second paper investigates the performance of several different controllers used to perform <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle described as a linear nonminimum-phase 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 bicycle model based on Ackerman steering. Both a conventional type I proportional-integral (PI) controller and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are considered. The PI controller is designed using standard techniques and the two-level FLC / PI controller adjusts both proportional and integral feedback control gains around the baseline values based on heuristics and the current conditions as measured by the lateral error. Time-based simulations using MATLAB / SIMULINK permit a comparison between both controllers for several different simulation scenarios of interest. Primary performance metrics considered were percent overshoot and settling time in response to a step input. In general, the two-level FLC / PI controller performed better; 6...|$|R

40|$|A <b>lateral</b> entry <b>guidance</b> is {{designed}} based on azimuth error and crossrange error for a low L/D ratio lunar return vehicle. The conventional technique {{to determine the}} bank sign is according to the crossrange error, which might cause large crossrange deviation during Kepler phase if azimuth error at skip out point is large. This paper develops a combined <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> logic to minish accumulate crossrange error caused by azimuth error during Kepler phase. The lateral logic decides the value of crossrange threshold by constantly predicting the crossrange at skip out point. The azimuth error at skip out point is regulated to a small value by only one bank reverse through online adjusting reversal threshold. The effect of earth rotation is compensated by moving the landing site to opposite direction. During the second entry, the lateral logical {{is designed}} based on the crossrange error to achieve precise lateral control.

5000|$|As Flight 9 {{approached}} Jakarta, {{the crew}} {{found it difficult}} to see anything through the windscreen, and made the approach almost entirely on instruments, despite reports of good visibility. The crew decided to fly the instrument landing system (ILS); however, the vertical <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> was inoperative, so they were forced to fly with only the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> as the first officer monitored the airport's distance measuring equipment (DME). He then called out how high they should be at each DME step along the final approach to the runway, creating a virtual glide slope for them to follow. It was, in Moody's words, [...] "a bit like negotiating one's way up a badger's arse." [...] Although the runway lights could be made out through a small strip of the windscreen, the landing lights on the aircraft seemed to be inoperable. After landing, the flight crew found it impossible to taxi, due to glare from apron floodlights which made the already sandblasted windscreen opaque.|$|R
40|$|A <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{algorithm}} {{which controls}} {{the location of}} the line of intersection between the actual and desired orbital planes (the hinge line) is developed for the aerobraking phase of a lift-modulated orbital transfer vehicle. The on-board targeting algorithm associated with this <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> algorithm is simple and concise which is very desirable since computation time and space are limited on an on-board flight computer. A variational equation which describes the movement of the hinge line is derived. Simple relationships between the plane error, the desired hinge line position, the position out-of-plane error, and the velocity out-of-plane error are found. A computer simulation is developed to test the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> algorithm for a variety of operating conditions. The algorithm does reduce the total burn magnitude needed to achieve the desired orbit by allowing the plane correction and perigee-raising burn to be combined in a single maneuver.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{analysing}} an integrated reconfigurable control and guidance approach for recovering a small fixed-wing UAV from different actuator faults, which cover locked in place (stuck) and loss of effectiveness. The model of the UAV Aerosonde is used to develop a reconfigurable control system based on the control allocation technique {{for a variety of}} faults, such as locked-in-place control surfaces. It is shown through simulation that the developed technique is successful to recover the aircraft from various faults but cannot guarantee success on the planned mission. For mission scenarios where performance degradation is such that the prescribed trajectory cannot be achieved, a reconfigurable <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> is developed, which is capable of adapting parameters such as the minimum turning radius and the look-ahead distance for obstacle avoidance, to allow the vehicle to dynamically generate a path which guides the aircraft around the no-fly zones taking into account the post-fault reduced performance. Path following is performed by means of a non-linear <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> law and a collision avoidance algorithm is implemented as well. Finally, the integration of control reconfiguration and guidance adaptation is carried out to maximise probabilities of post-failure success in the mission. A methodology is developed, using an error based control allocation parameter, as a measure of performance degradation, which links both reconfiguration and <b>guidance</b> <b>systems.</b> The developed method, although approximate, is proven to be an efficient way of allocating the required degree of reconfiguration in guidance commands when an accurate prediction of the actual performance is not available...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to compare the reproducibility of lateral tooth contacts of casts mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator when condylar guidance was set by different methods and (ii) to assess the margin of error of the variations of condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts, {{depending on the type of}} <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> In subjects with different types of <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance,</b> intraoral <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value of condylar guidance obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations of condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar <b>guidance</b> until <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts changed.

40|$|A {{variable}} look-ahead controller for the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{of vehicles}} for Automated Highway Systems is proposed. The control {{objective is to}} make the lateral error at a certain point ahead of the vehicle zero. The distance of this point from the vehicle is called the look-ahead distance.

50|$|Lateral {{navigation}} (LNAV) {{refers to}} navigating over a ground track with guidance from an electronic device {{that gives the}} pilot (or autopilot) error indications in the lateral direction only {{and not in the}} vertical direction. In aviation, lateral navigation is one of two guidance types: linear guidance and angular guidance. In linear guidance, the aircraft's deviation to the left or right of the desired ground track is given as a distance between the aircraft's current position and the desired track. In angular guidance, the error indication is given in degrees of angle from the desired line relative to a ground-based navigation device. To provide an illustration, as the aircraft approaches the ground device with a constant angular error, its distance to the desired ground line decreases. In the context of aviation instrument approaches, an LNAV approach (one that uses lateral navigation) is implied to be a GPS-based approach and to have linear <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> A VOR-based approach will have angular <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b>|$|R
