5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel {{transferred}} the {{control of the}} mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement</b> in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, Ottoman forces conquered Mamluk territory. Agricultural {{villages in}} Jordan {{witnessed}} {{a period of}} relative prosperity in the 16th century, but were later abandoned. For the next centuries, Ottoman rule in the region, at times, was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. This led to a short-lived occupation by the Wahhabi forces (1803–1812), an ultra-orthodox <b>Islamic</b> <b>movement</b> that emerged in Najd in modern-day Saudi Arabia. Ibrahim Pasha, son of {{the governor of the}} Egypt Eyalet under the request of the Ottoman sultan, rooted out the Wahhabis between 1811 and 1818. In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant. His oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834. The cities of Al-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's forces for harbouring a peasants' revolt leader. Egyptian rule was later forcibly ended, with Ottoman rule restored.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} power {{struggle in the}} discourse of Islam Nusantara which becomes very popular in contemporary Indonesian Islam. The idea of Islam Nusantara is not different from Islam in general, but with distinctive charactericstics, such as tawâzun, i‘tidâl, and tawassut}. The proponents of this idea claim that their intellectual framework {{is based on the}} principle of maslah}ah mursalah, istih}sân, and ‘urf. Using critical discourse analysis, this article attempts to see the other side of Islam Nusantara discourse. This study is based on an assumption that language and discourse are not only an instrument to convey ideas, but also a means to construct social reality. Social activities are always related to and constructed by their social settings. This article argues that the discourse of Islam Nusantara emerges as a part of struggle for influence between mainstream <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements,</b> such as Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, and new transnational <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements,</b> such as Tarbiyah, Hizbut Tahrir, and Salafis. The use of the term Islam Nusantara is indeed the effort of mainstream <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements</b> to create the image of indigenous <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements,</b> different from the newly imported <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements.</b> However, the discourse of Islam Nusantara seems to be reductionist and monolithic in perceiving diverse realities of Islam in Nusantara...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The West {{has often}} {{approached}} Hamas as monolithic and static. However, careful analysis {{reveals that the}} movement is flexible and fluid. Hamas actually provides its own discourse that offers an ever-changing framework of identity formation. By one merely labeling {{the group as a}} "terrorist " organization, the potential for comprehensive analysis is not only undermined but is reduced to focusing on the group’s actions and doctrinal aspects of its charter. Although some scholars have begun serious in-depth studies and research into the <b>Islamic</b> Resistance <b>Movement</b> as a dynamic group within a broader context of socio-economic and cultural factors influenced and generated by the Nakba and subsequent Israeli occupation, the gender ideology of Hamas as well as other <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements</b> has been greatly ignored.
