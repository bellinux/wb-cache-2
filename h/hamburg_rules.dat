50|$|The Rotterdam Rules are a set {{of rules}} {{designed}} to replace the <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> and the outdated Hague-Visby Rules (both of which are International Conventions to impose duties upon a carrier of goods by sea). Should the Rotterdam Rules come into effect, they would cover not merely the sea voyage, but all parts of any contract of carriage with a sea leg. Thereafter, land carriers, warehouses, and freight forwarders would need P&I cover. This would inevitably lead to an increase in the scope and importance of P&I cover, and might diminish the prevalence of standard cargo insurance.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no single [...] "international law of {{carriage}} of goods by sea", most sea-trading nations tend to adopt an international convention on such law, with a view to establishing a universal standard. The three main conventions are the Hague Rules of 1924, the Hague-Visby Rules of 1968 and the <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> of 1978. A further Convention, which seeks to modernise and replace all three previous conventions, is the Rotterdam Rules, which is much more extensive than its earlier counterparts. The Rotterdam Rules address issues such as multi-modal carriage, containerisation and volume contracts; but today, only Spain has ratified these rules, so they are not yet in force.|$|E

Whether a choice of a forum can be invalidated by a maritime Convention such as those containing the Hague, Hague-Visby, <b>Hamburg</b> and Rotterdam <b>Rules,</b> or national legislation similar to one of those Conventions, is explored {{in the light of the}} express provisions on choice of jurisdiction, international Conventions and public policy in Brussels I...|$|R
50|$|With only 10 Articles, the Rules {{have the}} virtue of brevity, but they have several faults. When, after 44 years of experience, the 1924 Rules were updated with a single minor amendment, they still covered only {{carriage}} wholly by sea (thereby ignoring multi-modal transport), and they barely acknowledged the container revolution of the 1950s. Also, the United Nations body UNCTAD felt that the Rules had actually diluted the protection to shippers once provided by English common law, and proposed instead the more modern <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> of 1978. These were embraced by many developing countries, but largely ignored by ship-operating nations. The modern Rotterdam Rules, with some 96 articles, have far more scope and cover multi-modal transport; but these Rules remain far from general implementation.|$|E
5000|$|The carrier's duties are not [...] "strict", but {{require only}} a {{reasonable}} standard of professionalism and care; and Article IV allows the carrier {{a wide range}} of situations exempting them from liability on a cargo claim. These exemptions include destruction or damage to the cargo caused by: fire, perils of the sea, Act of God, and act of war. A controversial provision exempts the carrier from liability for [...] "neglect or default of the master ... in the navigation or in the management of the ship". This provision is considered unfair to the shipper; and both the later <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> (which require contracting states to denounce the Hague-Visby Rules) and Rotterdam Rules (which are not yet in force) refuse exemption for negligent navigation and management.|$|E
50|$|In the {{carriage}} of goods by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The bill of lading (transport document used almost exclusively for {{carriage of goods}} by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee that acts as a receipt of transfer of goods and as a negotiable instrument. The bill of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the consignee of damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership of the goods until the bill of lading is transferred to the consignee. Most bills of lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules.</b> These rules impose minimum responsibilities and liabilities that cannot be softened by contract.

40|$|The Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea (<b>Hamburg</b> <b>rules)</b> {{was hoped}} {{to provide a}} uniform modern {{commercial}} code for the international carriage of goods by sea. However, 26 years after the diplomatic conference and nearly 13 years after it came into force, the rules have not been ratified by the world’s major maritime powers. The main contention of the maritime powers is that the <b>Hamburg</b> <b>rules</b> have increased the liability of the carrier to unbearable levels. The {{majority of the world}} maritime powers have thus continued to use the previous rules with some adopting a hybrid of the previous and the existing one. My thesis is therefore to assess {{the extent to which the}} <b>Hamburg</b> <b>rules</b> have increased the liability of the carrier. The focus will be on making a comparison between the <b>Hamburg</b> <b>rules</b> and the previous Hague rules, specifically on the provisions of the definition of the carrier, carrier’s period of responsibility, carrier’s obligation and the carrier’s general liability...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules.</b> The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules</b> do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under <b>Hamburg</b> <b>Rules.</b> The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} {{covers the}} history of the Levy family of Hamburg, Germany from 1837 through 1942. The bulk of the material relates to Ludwig Levy and his wife Ida née Winterberg, particularly the wealth that they lost during Nazi persecution and their efforts to emigrate. Materials include business records for the family metal smelting business, A. Levy Metallgeschäft, from its founding to its eventual forced sale and closure; banking, investment, and tax records; birth, marriage, and death certificates; an original certificate of Hamburg citizenship for Abraham Levy; inheritance papers; plans for gravestones; documentation of the capital levy (Vermögensausgabe) paid by Ida Levy; emigration papers; records of membership in and correspondence with Jewish organizations; limited personal correspondence; and a few photographs. Also included are clippings and official notices that document increasing restrictions set on Jewish residents of <b>Hamburg</b> during Nazi <b>rule.</b> digitizedLudwig Levy was born on March 10, 1875 in Hamburg. In 1906, Ludwig and his brother Joseph took over the family business, A. Levy Metallgeschäft, which had been founded by their father Abraham Levy. In 1907, Ludwig married Ida Winterberger (born October 3, 1883 in Winterberg to the businessman Moses Winterberger and his wife Rickchen). The couple had one son, Hartwig (born April 11, 1908), who studied law in Germany and immigrated to New York in the 1930 s, where he changed his name to Howard. Ida’s sister Else Irma Levy lived together with Ludwig and Ida. Between 1938 and 1941, the three of them attempted to emigrate, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Else died of a serious illness on July 28, 1940. Ludwig and Ida were deported to Theresienstadt on July 15, 1942 and then to Minsk on September 21, 1942, where they perished. Ludwig gave his personal papers to a non-Jewish friend shortly before his deportation. They eventually landed at the Zentralarchiv zur Erforschung der Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland in Heidelberg. From there, the papers were passed on to Irma Levy, the widow of Hartwig (Howard) Levy living in New York, who then donated the papers to the Leo Baeck Institute.
