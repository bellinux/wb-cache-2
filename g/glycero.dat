40|$|The {{production}} of monoacylglycerol by <b>glycero</b> lysis {{of olive oil}} in n-hexane, catalyzed by lipases from Candida rugosa, Chromo bacterium viscosum and Rhizopus sp. immobilized in a hydrophilic polyurethane foam was investigated. The highest monoacylglycerol production was reached with the Candida rugosa lipase. Thus, this was the enzyme selected for subsequent studies. The effect of the initial water activity (a_w) of the system on both <b>glycero</b> lysis and hydrolysis was evaluated. The yield of monoacylglycerol increased with decreasing a_w. The highest yield of monoacylglycerol (70 %, w/w) was obtained at the lowest a_w used (0. 23). During <b>glycero</b> lysis, even when hydrolysis was completely repressed (a_w values lower than 0. 43), release of fatty acids occurred. This suggests that the hydrolysis of the ester bond in the acyl glycerol, promoted by glycerol, was the first reaction step. During hydrolysis, both external and internal diffusion limitations for triacylglycerols were negligible. The increase in olive oil concentration appeared to promote an interfacial activation of the lipase, {{directly related to the}} hydrophobicity of the reaction medium. During operational stability studies, no deactivation of the lipase was detected after 15 successive batches (23 hours each) Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

The addition of one equivalent of methyllithium to the diacetonide of L-gulono- 1, 4 - lactone gave a keto-sugar, l-deoxy- 3, 4; 6, 7 -di- 0 -isopropylidene-β-L- gulo - heptulofuranose. The anomeric configuration of this compound was determined by equilibrium nOe measurements. Hydrolysis in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid caused simultaneous deprotection, isomerisation and dehydration to yield 2, 7 -anhydro-l-deoxy-β-L- gulo heptulopyranose, a highly stable, rigid bicyclic system. The structure of the bicyclic system was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies on a crystalline derivative. The introduction of nitrogen at C- 6 of L-gulono-l, 4 -lactone was achieved via the azide displacement of the known bromide, 6 -bromo- 6 -deoxy- 2, 3 - 0 - isopropylidene-L-gulono-l, 4 -lactone. Protection of the C- 5 hydroxyl group as its silyl ether {{was followed by the}} addition of one equivalent of methyllithium to the carbonyl group to give a keto-sugar, 7 -azido- 6 -(0 - tert -butyldimethylsilyl-l, 7 - dideoxy- 3, 4 - 0 -isopropylidene-β-L- gulo -heptulofuranose. Removal of the protecting groups followed by reduction of the azide functionality gave the bicyclic hemiaminal, l, 2, 7 -trideoxy- 2, 7 -imino-β-L- gulo -heptulopyranose, a stable but hygroscopic solid. A third bicyclic system, 2, 7 -anhydro-l, 2, 6 -trideoxy- 2, 6 -imino-β-L- gulo - heptulopyranose, was synthesised from diacetone-D-mannose via the known ketosugar, 6 -azido- 7 - 0 - tert -butyldimethylsilyl-l, 6 -dideoxy- 3, 4 - 0 -isopropylidene-β- L- gulo -heptulofuranose. Removal of the protecting groups from this keto-sugar, followed by reduction of the azide functionality, gave the target system. Analysis of the NMR spectra showed that this existed as an equilibrium mixture of the closed, bicyclic hemiaminal form and the monocyclic imine form, with the bicyclic form predominating in all solvents investigated. The sodium borohydride reduction of l-deoxy- 3, 4; 6, 7 -di- 0 -isopropylidene-β-L- gulo -heptulofuranose gave a single product, the heptitol 7 -deoxy-l, 2; 4, 5 -di- 0 -isopropylidene- L- <b>glycero</b> -D- gluco -heptitol. This was converted into two novel pyrrolidine amino sugars, l, 2, 5 -trideoxy- 2, 5 -imino-L- <b>glycero</b> -L- allo -heplitol and l, 2, 5 -trideoxy- 2, 5 -imino-L-allitol. The two free hydroxyl groups in the heptitol were converted into leaving groups and one was then displaced selectively with sodium azide. Reduction of the azide functionality gave an amine which cyclised onto the remaining leaving group to form the pyrrolidine framework. Complete deprotection of this product gave l, 2, 5 -trideoxy- 2, 5 -imino-L- <b>glycero</b> -L- allo - heptitol, the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies on a crystalline derivative.

The interaction of QBS dissolved in the subphase with DPPC monolayers and silicon supported bilayers was studied above the cmc 10 3 M. Surface pressure relaxation and surface dilatational rheology combined with quartz crystal microbalance QCM and neutron reflectivity NR were employed for this purpose. The DPPC penetrating abilities of QBS are {{compared with those of}} typical synthetic surfactants SDS, CTAB and Triton X 100. We show that the penetration studies using high surface activity bio surfactants should be performed by a subphase exchange, not by spreading onto the surfactant solution. In contrast to the synthetic surfactants of similar surface activity, QBS does not collapse DPPC mono and bilayers, but penetrates them, improving their surface dilatational elastic properties even in the highly compressed solid state. The dilatational viscoelasticity modulus increases from 204 mN m for pure DPPC up to 310 mN m for the QBS penetrated layers, while it drops to near zero values {{in the case of the}} synthetic surfactants. The estimated maximum insertion pressure of QBS into DPPC monolayers exceeds the maximum surface pressure achievable in our setup, in agreement with the surface rheological response of the penetrated layer...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the syntheses of some polyfunctionalised cyclopentanes via intramolecular aldol condensations of sugar δ-lactone precursors. The known azido carbpcycle (1 S, 2 R, 3 S, 4 R, 5 R) -methyl [5 -azido- 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydrpxy- 2, 3 - O -isopropylidene-cyclopentane] carboxylate was prepared from 2 - deoxy- 2 -iodo- 3, 4 : 6, 7 -di- O -isopropylidene-D- <b>glycero</b> -D- talo -heptono- 1, 5 -lactone in five steps. The key reaction was a base-induced intramolecular aldol cyclisation of a 5 - iodo-formyl- 2, 6 -lactone. Borohydride {{reduction of the}} methyl ester gave an azido triol. Deprotection followed by reduction of the azide functionality produced an amino pentol. The analogous tetrahydroxy β-amino acid was synthesised from the azido carbocycle in three steps. The inhibitory activity of the amino pentol against human liver glycosidases is reported. Two azido bicyclic lactones, (1 R, 4 R, 5 R, 6 R, 7 R) - 4 -azido- 5, 6, 7 -trihydroxy- 5, 6 - 0 - isopropylidene- 2 -oxa-bicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan- 3 -one and (1 S, 4 S, 5 R, 6 R, 7 R) - 4 -azido- 5, 6, 7 -trmydroxy- 5, 6 - O -isopropydilene- 2 -oxa-bicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan- 3 -one, were prepared from 3, 4 : 6, 7 -di- O -isopropylidene-D- <b>glycero</b> -D- talo -heptono- 1, 5 -lactone in five steps. The (1 R, 4 R, 5 R, 6 R, 7) -compound was further elaborated to give an amino pentol via a series of borohydride reduction / deprotection / catalytic hydrogenation. A novel carbocyclic spirohydantoin was synthesised by two alternative routes. The second route also provided access to an N' -phenyl spirohydantoin. The inhibitory activities of the amino pentol and the spirohydantoin against human liver glycosidases are reported. The azido bicyclic lactone triol (1 R, 4 S, 5 R, 6 R, 7 R) - 4 -azido- 5, 6, 7 -trihydroxy- 2 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan- 3 -one underwent reduction of the azide functionality with concomitant epimerisation to give the (5 S) -epimeric amine. The structure of this material was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of a crystalline derivative. Treatment of the azido triol with base under non-aqueous conditions resulted in a retroaldol reaction to give the (5 S) -epimeric azide, the relative configuration of which was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. A third ketal protected azido bicyclic lactone was prepared via a base-induced retro-aldol epimerisation. Five tetrahydroxycyclopentane α-amino acids, including a pair of enantiomers, were synthesised from the azido bicyclic lactones. The structures {{of two of the}} α-amino acids were established by X-ray crystallographic analysis, whilst the enantiomeric compounds were identified using circular dichroism spectrometry. The diketal protected (2 R, 3 R, 4 R, 5 R) -tetrahydroxy-cyclopentane α-amino acid was incorporated into six oligopeptides. Peptide coupling at the C -terminus of the carbocyclic amino acid was carried out using two amino acid tert -butyl esters. Chain extension at the N -terminus was achieved by reaction with N -benzyloxycarbonyl protected amino acids in the presence of 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride as the carbodiimide reagent. Complete deprotection of a tetrapeptide is described. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe recent {{discoveries of}} the {{involvement}} of SK 3 channel in some cell motility mechanisms occurring in cancer disease have opened up {{the way to the}} synthesis of inhibitors that could reduce metastasis formation. On the basis of our recent previous works showing that both lactose-glycero-ether lipid () and some phosphate analogues () were efficient compounds to modulate SK 3 channel activity, the present study, which found its inspiration {{in the structure of the}} natural glycolipid DiGalactosylDiacylGlycerol (DGDG), reports the incorporation of a digalactosyl moiety (α-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 6) -β-galactopyranosyl-) as the polar head of a <b>glycero</b> ether lipid. For the construction of the digalactosyl fragment, two synthetic approaches were compared. The standard strategy which is based on the use of the benzyl protecting group to produce 1 → 6 disaccharide unit, was compared with a second method that made use of the trimethylsilyl moiety as a protecting group. This second strategy, which is applied for the first time to the synthesis of (1 → 6) -disaccharide unit, presents a net advantage in terms of efficacy (better global yield) and cost. Finally, compound, which is characterized by a (1 → 6) DiGalactosyl unit (DG) as the polar head of the amphiphilic structure, was tested as a modulator of the SK 3 channel activity. Patch-clamp experiments have shown that compound reduced SK 3 currents (- 28. 2 ± 2. 0 % at 5 μM) and cell migration assays performed at 300 nM have shown a reduction of cell migration (SK 3 + HEK 293 T) by 19. 6 ± 2. 7 %...|$|E

Neutron diffraction was used to characterise the samples in terms of transition temperatures, whereas elastic incoherent neutron scattering EINS demonstrates that the dynamics on the sub macromolecular length scale and pico to nano second time scale are correlated with the structural transitions through a discontinuity in the observed elastic intensities and the derived mean square displacements. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed in parallel focussing on the length, time and temperature scales of the neutron experiments. They correctly reproduce the structural features of the main gel liquid phase transition. Particular emphasis is placed on the dynamical amplitudes derived from experiment and simulations. Two methods are used to analyse the experimental data and mean square displacements. They agree within a factor of 2 irrespective of the probed time scale, i. e. the instrument utilized. Mean square displacements computed from simulations show a comparable level of agreement with the experimental values, albeit, the best match with the two methods varies for the two instruments. Consequently, experiments and simulations together give a consistent picture of the structural and dynamical aspects of the main lipid transition and provide a basis for future, theoretical modelling of dynamics and phase behaviour in membranes. The need for more detailed analytical models is pointed out by the remaining variation of the dynamical amplitudes derived in two different ways from experiments {{on the one hand and}} simulations on the othe...|$|E
40|$|Plants from {{temperate}} climate zones {{are able to}} increase their freezing tolerance during exposure to low, above zero temperatures in a process termed cold acclimation. During this process, several cold regulated COR proteins are accu mulated in the cells. One of them is COR 15 A, a small, intrinsically disordered protein that contributes to leaf freezing tolerance by stabilizing cellular membranes. The isolated protein folds into amphipathic a helices in response to increased crowding condi tions, such as high concentrations of glycerol. Although there is evidence for direct COR 15 A membrane interactions, the orien tation and depth of protein insertion were unknown. In addition, although folding due to high osmolyte concentrations had been established, the folding response of the protein under conditions of gradual dehydration had not been investigated. Here we show, using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, that COR 15 A starts to fold into a helices already under mild dehydration conditions 97 relative humidity RH, corresponding to freezing at 3 C and that folding gradually increases with decreasing RH. Neutron diffraction experiments at 97 and 75 RH established {{that the presence of}} COR 15 A had no significant influence on the structure of 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl sn <b>glycero</b> 3 phosphocholine POPC membranes. However, using deuterated POPC we could clearly establish that COR 15 A interacts with the membranes and penetrates below the headgroup region into {{the upper part of the}} fatty acyl chain region.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{recently}} reported spectroscopic evidence for structural relaxation of myoglobin (Mb) following photodissociation of MbCO [Lambright, D. G., Balasubramanian, S., & Boxer, S. G. (1991) Chem. Phys. 158, 249 - 2601, In this paper we report measurements {{for a series}} of single amino acid mutants of human myoglobin on the distal side of the heme pocket (positions 45, 64, and 68) in order to examine specific structural determinants involved in this conformational relaxation and to determine the nature of the coupling between relaxation and the functional process of ligand binding. The kinetics of ligand binding and conformational relaxation were monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy in the Soret spectral region, and the results are analyzed using a four-state ligand binding model. Two principal results emerge: (1) amino acid substitutions in the distal heme pocket affect the kinetics of the nonequilibrium conformational relaxation and (2) the rate of ligand escape from the protein matrix is not significantly perturbed by the distal heme pocket mutations. Much of our knowledge regarding the mechanism of ligand binding to myoglobin (Mb) ' comes from extensive studies of CO rebinding to photolyzed Mb in viscous <b>glycero</b> 1 :water solutions [see for example Austin et al. (1975), Beece et al. (1980), Hasinoff (1981), Ansari et al. (1986), and Campbell et al. (1987) j. In glycerol glasses below- 200 K, the kinetics of CO rebinding to Mb are highly nonexponential, and this has been interpreted as reflecting a distribution of barrier heights for the iron-ligand bond formation step (process I; Austin et al., 1975). A variety of theoretical models have been developed to explain this basic observation (Agmon &...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen (H 2) {{has been}} {{considered}} as energy of future to substitute fossil fuel utilization. It is currently produced from hydrocarbon reforming (i. e. natural gas and petroleum) and electrolysis processes. Therefore, in the current work, magnesium oxide (MgO) -supported Ni catalyst with Cerium, Ce as a promoter was prepared to produce the synthesis gas H 2 from the glycerol reforming reaction and the activity of catalyst is studied. Besides, the physicochemical properties of fresh catalysts were characterized with various techniques. BET characterization of both fresh 3 wt% and 5 wt% Ce-Ni/MgO catalysts showed that the 5 wt% Ce-Ni/MgO catalyst has larger BET specific surface area and pore diameter than the 3 wt% Ce-Ni/MgO catalyst. XRD diffraction pattern of fresh 5 wt% Ce-Ni/MgO catalyst showed peaks representing MgO at 2 θ = 37. 00  and NiO at 42. 99 , 62. 41 , 74. 84  and 78. 79 . From the FESEM imaging of 5 wt% Ce-Ni/MgO catalyst, it can be observed {{that it is a}} crystalline catalyst. TGA results summarized that the magnitude of the highest peak increases as the heating ramp increases from 10 to 20 C/min. Besides that, reaction studies have found that the 3 wt% catalysts gave almost equal rate of formation of product yield (H 2 and CO). From the results obtained, the glycerol conversion, XG was directly proportional with the reactant (glycerol to N 2) flow ratios. Furthermore, the activation energy obtained for H 2 formation rate from the current study was 27. 82 kJ/mol.

Subjects: Thirty patients and 15 normal volunteers. Methods: Each subject of this study underwent pure tone audiometry testing, evoked vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and Vidionystagmography (VNG) before G 1 and 2 Â h after glycerol G 2 administration (1. 3 Â g/kg). Results: Affected ears were 32 and unaffected ears were 28. The affected ears had higher hearing and SRT thresholds {{when compared to the}} unaffected ears and control group. VEMPs of the affected ears were normal in six ears (18. 75 %), absent in four ears (12. 5 %) and augmented amplitude in 22 (68. 75 %), their VNG results showed peripheral vestibular disorder. After oral administration of glycerol, the previous test battery was repeated and itâs result on PTA showed that 53. 13 % (17 / 32) of affected ears had positive glycerol test mainly in stage II and III. Ten of the 32 affected ears (31. 26 %) showed improvement of VEMPs after glycerol administration. Also, two (7. 8 %) of the unaffected ears showed positive glycerol. Latency of the VEMP had no significant changes after glycerol administration and there was no statistical correlation between the results of G-PTA and G-VEMP. There was statistical significant improvement of the slow peak velocity of caloric test in patientâs affected ears and insignificant improvement in control group and in unaffected ears after glycerol administration.

Piles of 11 bilayer membranes of 1, 2 dimyristoyl sn <b>glycero</b> 3 phosphocholine DMPC are immobilized at the interface {{of the solid}} silicon support and the liquid D 2 O backing phase. We replace the natural hyaluronic acid HA component of synovial fluid by a synthetic substitute, namely, poly allylamine hydrochloride PAH, at identical concentration. We find the oligolamellar DMPC bilayer films strongly interacting with PAR resulting in a drastic increase of the membranes d spacing {{by a factor of}} similar to 5. Onset of shear causes a buckling like deformation of the DMPC bilayers perpendicular to the applied shear field. With increasing shear rate we observe substantially enhanced water fractions in the membrane slabs which we attribute to increasing fragmentation caused by Kelvin Helmholtz like instabilities parallel to the applied shear field.
