25|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>Yellow</b> {{was once}} {{produced}} by collecting the urine of cattle {{that had been}} fed only mango leaves. Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th and 18th centuries favored it for its luminescent qualities, and often used it to represent sunlight. Since mango leaves are nutritionally inadequate for cattle, the practice of harvesting <b>Indian</b> <b>Yellow</b> was eventually declared to be inhumane. Modern hues of <b>Indian</b> <b>Yellow</b> are made from synthetic pigments.|$|R

30|$|A mixed green {{containing}} <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> and indigo {{occurs on}} the 16 th century folio altered at the Mughal court, (Table  1, # 35)—where {{it is used}} on the insert—and in two 18 th century Iranian works (Table  1, # 37 – 38). In all three of these, <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> also occurs as the pure yellow pigment and this use of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> {{can be attributed to}} links with Mughal India (see below). In one of the 18 th century works, (Table  1, # 37), the <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> and indigo combination was used for dark green details whilst a mixture of orpiment and indigo was used for light green details on the same robe.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> is a transparent, {{fluorescent}} pigment used in oil paintings and watercolors. Originally magnesium euxanthate, it was {{claimed to have}} been produced from the urine of Indian cows fed only on mango leaves. It has now been replaced by synthetic <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> hue.|$|R
50|$|Due to its fluorescence, <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> is {{especially}} vivid and bright in sunlight. It was likely first used by Dutch artists. Before {{the end of}} the 18th century it was commonly used by artists across Europe. The origin of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> was considered a mystery until 1883.|$|R
30|$|The {{identification}} of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> {{in some of}} the art works studied contrasts with published studies to date. The manufacture of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> {{has been the subject of}} a number of recent papers [28, 36]. <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> occurs in <b>Indian</b> works from the 16 th through 19 th century [18, 28, 29] and was likely produced in India from the urine of cows fed exclusively on mango leaves [28]. Although there is one reference to <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> being introduced to India from Persia in the 15 th century [37], <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> has not previously been found on works firmly ascribed to Iran [5, 7, 14, 18]. It is hence often considered diagnostic of Indian works—a view that must now be reconsidered in light of its identification in works of clear Persian rather than Indian production. However, use of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> within Persia does appear to be fairly rare and restricted to the late 17 th to 18 th century. This may reflect the culture of the time as well as the production site. The manuscript containing <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> (Table  1, # 36) is believed to have been made in late 17 th century Isfahan, known for its cosmopolitan nature and extensive trade networks. The figures depicted in the two folios (Table  1, # 37 – 38) have Afsharid clothes, named for the dynasty founded by Nader Shah Afshar in about 1736. Nader Shah Afshar invaded India in 1739 and although he did not remain long in India, the works were thus produced in a society that had recent close links to Mughal India with exchange of materials or local patronage of the arts likely. Work is on-going to assess the extent to which <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> occurs within the Persian manuscript and painting tradition.|$|R

50|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>yellow,</b> {{also called}} euxanthin or euxanthine, is a xanthonoid. It is {{transparent}} yellow pigment used in oil painting and watercolors. Chemically it is a magnesium euxanthate, a magnesium salt of euxanthic acid. <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> is a clear, deep and luminescent yellow pigment with a color deeper than gamboge but less pure than cadmium yellow.|$|R
50|$|In her 2004 book Color: A Natural History of the Palette, Victoria Finlay {{examined}} whether <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> {{was really}} made from cow urine. The only printed source mentioning {{this practice is}} a single letter written by Mr. T.N. Mukharji, {{who claimed to have}} seen the color being made. Aside from this letter, there appear to be no written sources from the time period mentioning the production of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow.</b> Finlay searched for legal records concerning the supposed banning of <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> production in both the India Library in London and the National Library in Calcutta, and found none. She visited the town in India mentioned in Mukharji's letter as the only source of the color, but found no trace of evidence that the color had ever been produced there. None of the locals she spoke with had ever heard of the practice. It is possible that <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> came from another source, and that the cow urine story was fabricated by Mukharji, but came to be accepted by later authors. As such, the viability of producing <b>Indian</b> <b>yellow</b> from the urine of mango-leaf-fed cows is unknown.|$|R
