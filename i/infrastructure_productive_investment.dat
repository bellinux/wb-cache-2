In this paper, we {{analyze the}} use of fiscal and {{monetary}} instruments to improve long-run welfare when <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> is irreversible and uncollat-eralizable {{and there is no}} insurance. Only fiat money or government-issued bonds provide self-insurance. We demonstrate that an increase in precautionary savings reduces irreversible <b>productive</b> <b>investment.</b> Hence, subsidies to promote <b>productive</b> but irreversible <b>investment</b> should be financed {{in such a way that}} they do not reduce insurance capability. When lump-sum subsidies are high, a consumption tax is likely to be more redistributive and thus more consumption smoothing than are the other sets of instruments analyzed in our model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the prospective value {{of social capital}} for developmental purposes. It contends that the role that social relationships play in poor actors’ efforts to cope with and move out of poverty needs to be assessed under a dual understanding of social structure, as both the medium and outcome of social action. The study adopts Bourdieu’s ‘theory of practice’ as its main theoretical approach. Actors’ investments in and uses of relationships were analysed {{in relation to their}} objective conditions—stocks of capital—and associated practices and strategies. Social capital was operationalised as both networks of relations (local, external, and vertical) and social resources (mediated access to assets of local economic relevance). This approach was empirically examined via a two-year longitudinal study that followed the experiences of residents of two poor rural villages located in the Department of Lambayeque, in Northern Peru, with regard to their quotidian practices and involvement in a participatory development intervention that conducted basic <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>productive,</b> and informational <b>investments.</b> The study used a mixed-method approach comprising in-depth and unstructured interviews with residents and project staff; household surveys (three waves); and participatory observation. The evidence obtained showed that residents make extensive use of their relationships for economic purposes. Most valuable social resources and connections, however, were unequally accessed by residents according to their levels of poverty. This unequal (re) production of social capital was found to be related to actors’ material conditions and quotidian practices. This social dynamic tended to be reproduced within the participatory intervention examined, leading to an unequal expansion of social capital and related benefits among its beneficiaries. The study concludes that the structural conditionality of the processes of using and building social capital makes it intimately associated with socioeconomic inequalities. The theoretical and practical implications of this work are discussed in the concluding chapter...|$|R

40|$|The {{call for}} an {{across-the-board}} cut in {{the capital gains tax}} rate has won growing bipartisan support. Advocates claim that a tax cut would spur new <b>investment,</b> reward <b>productive</b> enterprise, serve as a simple proxy for inflation indexing, 1 and generate additional tax revenue from the consequent increases in asset turnover and productivity. Opponents contend {{a capital gains tax cut}} would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, that <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> is relatively insensitive to capital gains tax rates, 2 and that any boost to asset turnover would be merely temporary. However, such debate ignores the fact that a large and growing share of capital gains tax revenues, perhaps as large as two-thirds of such receipts, are generated in the real estate sector, a sector that has little discernible impact on <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> or employment. Moreover, the recent stock market rise has enlarged the number of taxpayers who now stand to gain from a capital gains tax cut [...] even as it further weakens the rationale that a cut is required to stimulate economic growth.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the interplay between long term <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> and more short term and liquid {{speculative}} ones. A three-period lived overlapping generations model allows us to make this distinction. Agents have two investment decisions. When young, they can invest in productive capital that provides a return during the following two periods. When young or in the middle age, they can also invest in a bubble. Assuming, in accordance with the empirical evidence, that the bubbleless economy is dynamically efficient, the existence of a stationary bubble raises <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> and production. Indeed, young agents sell short the bubble to increase <b>productive</b> <b>investments,</b> whereas traders at middle age transfer wealth to the old age. We outline that a technological change inducing either a larger return of capital in the short term or a similar increase in the return of capital in both periods raises productive capital, production and the bubble size. This framework also allows us to discuss several economic applications: the effects of both regulation on limited borrowing and fiscal policy on the occurrence of bubbles, the introduction of a probability of market crash and the effect of bubbles on income inequality...|$|R

40|$|Spending on <b>productive</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{is seen as}} an {{important}} contributor to long term economic growth. Several authors have documented a downward trend in public investment during the last three decades and warned about its possible detrimental effects on the economy. A not well-realized fact is that <b>productive</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investment</b> is mostly provided by sub-national governments. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the effect of revenue decentralization on the provision of infrastructure at the sub-national level. We estimate the effects of revenue decentralization and earmarked grant financing on the level of sub-national infrastructure investment in 20 European countries over the period 1990 - 2009. The findings are compared to those obtained when using sub-national investment in redistribution, for which the theory predictions are different. To account for the high auto-correlation in the dependent variable, we apply a dynamic panel data approach. In particular, we use a Corrected Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDVC) estimator with the lagged dependent variable included to account for the dynamic character of the dependent variable. The empirical analysis shows that decentralisation in terms of tax shares increases public investment in infrastructure; public investment in redistribution is not significantly affected by decentralisation. The positive link between total regional investment and decentralisation suggests that decentralisation on regional infrastructure investment is additional and does not go hand in hand with a considerable reduction in other types of regional investment, such as health, education or safety. As to investment grants, they have a positive impact on both types of regional investment. The negative interaction between investment grants and decentralisation for regional infrastructure investment suggest that the impact of tax decentralisation on regional infrastructure investment declines with increasing receipts of investment grants by regional governments. This result is intuitive. As the significance of the tax-decentralisation parameter suggests, higher regional decision autonomy leads to more investment in infrastructure. Attempts to undermine the power of regions through the backdoor - e. g. by introducing conditional transfers - will at least partly offset the positive effect of decentralisation...|$|R

30|$|The {{relationship}} between household remittance income {{and the financial}} sector discussed above yields several testable hypotheses. First, households that lack access to financial services {{are more likely to}} use remittances to finance <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> and large purchases, such as homes and land, than those with access. Second, this substitution effect should decline as the financial sector develops. That is, as competition among the financial sector increases, declining transfer costs makes remittances more attractive relative to bank loans. So, at some point, financial sector development can make households more likely to use remittances to finance investments and large purchases. Finally, {{an increase in the number}} of financial products should compete with other investment opportunities. Thus, the use of remittances for <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> will decline as banks begin to offer lower-risk alternative investments.|$|R
