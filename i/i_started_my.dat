5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

500|$|After {{a series}} of co-starring film roles, Lopez {{received}} her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E

And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E

When I came here, as an apprentice, there was six ships being built, right where I'm standing. It was {{an extraordinary}} place. A hive of activity. Welders, caulkers, platers, burners, joiners, engineers, electricians. I learned how men talked to one another, and how merciless Glasgow humour can be. It has made an indelible mark on me."

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical.

They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> career.

2500|$|Mara {{founded the}} charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, {{and medical care}} for orphans in Kibera, a Nairobi, Kenya slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased. The charity {{auctioned}} memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money. She visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with {{the growing number of}} nonprofits that are just business opportunities. [...] "The people who need help aren’t really getting it. So <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> own", she told Interview magazine in 2009. Mara later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. [...] "I need to do both; I can't just do acting," [...] she stated to The Journal News. In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring. Uweza is a Swahili word meaning opportunity, ability, and power. Mara serves {{as the president of the}} board of directors for the foundation.|$|E

It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand.
