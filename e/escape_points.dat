The {{model is the}} rectangular billiard and {{the shape of the}} <b>escape</b> <b>point</b> is assumed to have a semicircular form. Stickiness and self-similar structures for the escape times and emission angles are generated inside "backgammon" like stripes of initial conditions. These stripes are born at the boundary between two different emission angles but same escape times. As the rounding effects increase, backgammon stripes start to overlap and the escape times statistics obeys the power law decay and anomalous diffusion is expected. Tiny rounded borders (around 0. 1 % from the whole billiard size) are shown to be sufficient to generate the sticky motion, while borders larger than 10 % are enough to produce escape times with chaotic decay.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a class of}} transcendental meromorphic functions f: C ↦ → C with infinitely many poles. Under some regularity assumption on the location of poles and {{the behavior of the}} function near the poles, we provide explicite lower bounds for the hyperbolic dimension (Hausdorff dimension of radial points) of the Julia set and upper bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of <b>escaping</b> <b>points</b> in the Julia set. In particular the Hausdorff dimension of the latter set is less than the Hausdorff dimension of the former set. Consequently, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of <b>escaping</b> <b>points</b> is less than 2 and the area of this set is equal to zero. The functions under consideration may have infinitely many singular values, and we do not even assume them to belong to the class B.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the evolution of}} a connected set in Euclidean space carried by a periodic incompressible stochastic flow. While for almost every realization of the random flow at time t most of the particles are at a distance of order √ t away from the origin [DKK 1], there is an uncountable set of measure zero of points, which escape to infinity at the linear rate [CSS 1]. In this paper we prove that this set of linear <b>escape</b> <b>points</b> has full Hausdorff dimension. Dedicated to our teacher Yakov Sinai on occasion of his 65 th birthday. 1. Introduction. One of the greatest achievements in mathematics of {{the second half of the}} last century was creation of the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems in works of Anosov, Bowen, Ruelle, Sinai, Smale and many others.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{diagnosis}} and outcome of a haemodynamic strategy {{for the treatment of}} primary varicose veins associated with anterograde diastolic flow (ADF) in the Giacomini vein (GV). MethodsADF in the GV, with the escape point located at the saphenopopliteal junction, was demonstrated in 15 patients (15 limbs) by duplex ultrasound. No other <b>escape</b> <b>points</b> were seen in this group. ADF was defined as the flow present in the relaxing phase after isometric contraction of the lower limb, measured in the standing position. Duplex and clinical follow-up was performed prospectively at 1 week, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and once per year thereafter, between 1998 and 2001. Surgery consisted of flush division of the GV from the small saphenous vein (SSV) and division of the incompetent collateral veins from the GV. ResultsGV diameter showed an average reduction from 6 to 4 mm 33 months after surgery. Fourteen patients (93 %) showed no symptoms or varicose veins. GV reconnection and recurrent ADF was demonstrated in two patients (13 %). ConclusionsADF is a rare condition associated with primary varicose veins. ADF occurs when there is a closed venovenous shunt with recirculation in the muscular diastole. This implies that, although a part of the circuit is ascendant, the re-entry point must be located downstream to the scape point. Accurate duplex assessment is required to distinguish this atypical haemodynamic condition from an abnormal systolic circuit bypassing a deep vein obstruction. Interruption of the GV above its junction with the SSV abolished ADF with an acceptable rate of recurrences...|$|E
