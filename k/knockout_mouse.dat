5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. <b>Knockout</b> <b>mouse</b> studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine is an {{antagonist}} at {{all four}} adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies.

Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system.

40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the most}} common form of inherited mental retardation. The syndrome results from the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is encoded by the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR 1) gene. FMR 1 and its two paralogs, fragile X–related genes 1 and 2 (FXR 1 and - 2), form the Fmr 1 gene family. Here, we examined long-lasting synaptic plasticity in Fmr 1 knockout, Fxr 2 knockout, and Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> We found that metabotropic glutamate receptor–dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in the hippocampus was affected in Fmr 1 knockout, Fxr 2 knockout, and Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> at young ages (4 – 6 wk old). In addition, Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> showed significant deficiencies relative to either Fmr 1 or Fxr 2 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> in baseline synaptic transmission and short-term presynaptic plasticity, suggesting FMRP and FXR 2 P may contribute in a cooperative manner to pathways regulating presynaptic plasticity.

High throughput whole transcriptome profiling of the FoxD1-Dicer <b>knockout</b> <b>mouse</b> model revealed ectopic upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2L11 (Bim) and dysregulation of the p53 pathway with increase in p53 effector genes including Bax, Trp53inp1, Jun, Cdkn1a, Mmp2, and Arid3a. p53 protein levels remained unchanged, suggesting that FoxD1 stromal miRNAs directly repress p53-effector genes. Using a lineage tracing approach followed by Fluorescent-activated cell sorting, miRNA profiling of the FoxD1-derived cells not only comprehensively defined the transcriptional landscape of miRNAs that are critical for vascular development, but also identified key miRNAs {{that are likely to}} modulate the renal phenotype in its absence.

This suggests that SHH is partially responsible for the branching of the lungs. Further evidence of SHH’s role in lung branching has been seen with qPCR. SHH expression occurs in the developing lungs around embryonic day 11 and is strongly expressed in the buds of the fetal lungs but low in the developing bronchi.

2500|$|Regarding the {{mechanistic}} role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, {{transgenic mouse}} {{studies have shown}} somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional <b>knockout</b> <b>mouse</b> that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably {{to compensate for the}} loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. [...] Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.|$|E
40|$|Protein {{phosphatase}} 1 plays a {{major role}} in the governance of excitatory synaptic activity, and is subject to control via the neuromodulatory actions of dopamine.

The requirement for these proteins in dopamine-related neuromodulation was tested using <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Dopamine D 1 -mediated regulation of alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate receptor activity was deficient in both striatal and prefrontal cortical neurons from neurabin knockout mice; in spinophilin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> this deficit was manifest only in striatal neurons. At corticostriatal synapses long-term potentiation was deficient in neurabin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice,</b> but not in spinophilin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice,</b> and was rescued by a D 1 receptor agonist. In contrast, long-term depression was deficient in spinophilin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> but not in neurabin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice,</b> and was rescued by D 2 receptor activation. Spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic current frequency was increased in neurabin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice,</b> but not in spinophilin <b>knockout</b> <b>mice,</b> and this effect was normalized by D 2 receptor agonist application. Both knockout strains displayed increased induction of GluR 1 Ser(845) phosphorylation in response to D 1 receptor stimulation in slices, and also displayed enhanced locomotor activation in response to cocaine administration.

Dent's disease results from mutations of the voltage-gated chloride channel CLC- 5. METHODS: We studied the effect of zero and high citrate diet on renal function of ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> and wild-type mice. The mice were placed in metabolic cages from which the urine was collected. Mice were sacrificed to obtain serum and tissues for analysis. RESULTS: ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> fed zero or high citrate diet had significantly increased urinary calcium excretion compared with wild-type mice fed the same diets. Nine-month-old ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> on a zero citrate diet had significantly decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), whereas 9 -month-old ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> on a high citrate diet had normal renal function. ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> fed a zero citrate diet had significantly increased tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, cystic changes, and nephrocalcinosis compared to ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> fed a high citrate diet. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was significantly increased in 9 -month-old ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> on zero citrate diet compared to 9 -month-old wild-type mice on the same diet. CONCLUSION: High citrate diet preserved renal function and delayed progression of renal disease in ClC- 5 <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> even in the apparent absence of stone formation.

In addition, Rab 8 a is mislocalised in Rab 11 a <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Conversely, Rab 11 a is mislocalised in Rab 8 a <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> and in a microvillus atrophy patient, which has a mutation in the myosin Vb gene. Our data show an essential role for Rab 11 a in the localisation of apical proteins in the intestine and demonstrate functional relationships between Rab 11 a, Rab 8 a and myosin Vb in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Inhibition of {{pressure}} natriuresis in mice lacking the AT 2 receptorBackgroundAngiotensin II type 2 (AT 2) receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> have higher blood pressures than wild-type mice; however, the hypertension is imperfectly defined. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} renal mechanisms could be contributory. MethodsWe conducted pressure-natriuresis-diuresis experiments, measured renal cortical and medullary blood flow by laser Doppler methods, and explored cytochrome P 450 -dependent arachidonic acid metabolism by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsBlood pressure was 15 mm Hg higher in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> than in controls, and pressure diuresis and natriuresis curves were shifted rightward. At similar renal perfusion pressures (113 to 118 mm Hg), wild-type mice excreted threefold more sodium and water than AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Fractional sodium and water excretion curves were shifted rightward in parallel. Renal blood flow ranged between 6. 72 and 7. 88 mL/min/g kidney wet weight (kwt) in wild-type and between 5. 84 and 6. 15 mL/min/g kwt in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Renal vascular resistance was increased in AT 2 A receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Cortical blood flow readings leveled at 2. 5 V in wild-type and 1. 5 V in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> Medullary blood flow readings ranged between 0. 8 and 1. 0 V and increased 116 % in wild-type mice as renal perfusion pressure was increased. This increase did not occur in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was similar in both groups at approximately 1 mL/min/g kwt. Renal microsomes from AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> had less activity in hydroxylating arachidonic acid to 20 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20 -meter) than controls, whereas renal AT 1 receptor gene expression was increased in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice.</b> ConclusionsHemodynamic and tubular factors modify renal sodium handling in AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> <b>mice</b> and may cause hypertension. AT 2 receptor disruption induces alterations of other regulatory systems, including altered arachidonic acid metabolism, that {{may contribute to the}} intrarenal differences observed between AT 2 receptor <b>knockout</b> and wild-type <b>mice...</b>|$|R
