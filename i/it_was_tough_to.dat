500|$|Following the {{production}} struggles of The Lord of the Rings, Bakshi decided {{to work on}} something more personal. He pitched American Pop to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film in which songs would be given a new context in juxtaposition to the visuals. American Pop follows four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians, whose careers parallel the history of American pop and starred actor Ron Thompson in a dual lead role. While the film does not reflect Bakshi's own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by people he had encountered in Brownsville. The film's crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams. Bakshi again used rotoscoping, {{in an attempt to}} capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film's story. According to Bakshi, [...] "Rotoscoping is terrible for subtleties, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> get facial performances to match the stage ones." [...] Bakshi was able to acquire the rights to an extensive soundtrack—including songs by Janis Joplin, The Doors, George Gershwin, The Mamas & the Papas, Herbie Hancock, Lou Reed, and Louis Prima—for under $1 million. Released on February 12, 1981, the film was a financial success. The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "I'm amazed at the success that Mr. Bakshi has in turning animated characters into figures of real feelings." [...] Jerry Beck called it [...] "one of Bakshi's best films". Due to music clearance issues, it was not released on home video until 1998.|$|E
