60|$|The little fellow, who was <b>holding</b> her <b>apron,</b> gave such a lusty shout, {{that the}} sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her skirts, to her great admiration. I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but not much older-looking, stood before me.|$|R
60|$|He {{had already}} stepped two yards from {{her when he}} said the last word. Tessa could not have spoken; she was pale, and a great sob was rising; but she turned round as if she felt there was no hope for her, and stepped on, <b>holding</b> her <b>apron</b> so forgetfully that the {{apricots}} began to roll out on the grass.|$|R
60|$|When he {{came into}} the gulley he heard voices through the bushes, and {{pressing}} forward anxiously he saw Blane and Oates before the hovel door, Patience standing there crying, with the baby in her arms, and Rusha <b>holding</b> her <b>apron,</b> and an elderly man whom Stead knew as old Lady Elmwood's steward talking to the other men, who seemed to be persuading him to something.|$|R

An article in a newspaper on February 12, 1909 said “The ladies of the W. C. T. U. will <b>hold</b> an <b>apron</b> sale {{in the basement of}} the Universalist church, Feb. 17th. The date is in honor of the birthday of [...] Miss Frances Willard, who was the founder of the organization of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

Supper 10 cents, all welcome.” (100 Years Ago).|$|R
2500|$|Kidd also visited Block Island around 1699, {{where he}} was {{supplied}} by Mrs. Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of the mariner James Sands. The story has it that, for her hospitality, Mrs. Raymond was bid to <b>hold</b> out her <b>apron,</b> into which Kidd threw gold and jewels until it was full. After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to northern New London, Connecticut (later Montville), where she bought much land. The Raymond family was thus {{said to have been}} [...] "enriched by the apron".|$|R
60|$|And {{with such}} pretty {{nonsense}} the two stood together, Dennet {{in her white}} cap, short crimson kirtle, little stiff collar, and white bib and <b>apron,</b> <b>holding</b> her bird upside down in one hand, {{and with the other}} trying to keep his angry beak from pecking Stephen, who, in his leathern coat and apron, grimed, as well as his crisp black hair, with soot, stood towering above her, stooping to hold out the lustrous wing with one hand while he used his smallest pair of shears with the other to clip the pen-feathers.|$|R

The Mother arranged her papers, went to bed; and the whole of that (TOUT CELA) is sleeping like a dormouse, at the hour I write to you."

5000|$|In 1699, Scottish sailor William Kidd visited Block Island, {{shortly before}} he was hanged for piracy. At Block Island, he was {{supplied}} by Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of mariner James Sands. The story has it that, for her hospitality, Kidd bade Mrs. Raymond to <b>hold</b> out her <b>apron,</b> into which he threw gold and jewels until it was full.

5000|$|Beth {{stands at}} the bed with a {{suitcase}} on it and begins to fold clothes {{and put them in}} the suitcase. Brad stands wearing a [...] "World's Greatest Dad" [...] <b>apron</b> <b>holding</b> a spatula and a container of charcoal lighter fluid. Beth tells him that she is leaving and that she is not and has not been happy for a long time. Brad is worried about what their cookout party guests will think of him and sarcastically asks if Beth would be happy if he made a huge scene in front of them. Beth, in her anger, says that she really doesn't care. Brad reaches for her as she attempts to exit and Beth screams at him not to touch her.|$|R
60|$|<b>Holding</b> up her <b>apron</b> full {{of flowers}} {{with her left}} hand, Proserpina seized the large shrub with the other, and pulled and pulled, but was hardly able to loosen the soil about its roots. What a deep-rooted plant it was! Again the girl pulled with all her might, and {{observed}} that the earth began to stir and crack to some distance around the stem. She gave another pull, but relaxed her hold, fancying {{that there was a}} rumbling sound right beneath her feet. Did the roots extend down into some enchanted cavern? Then, laughing at herself for so childish a notion, she made another effort; up came the shrub, and Proserpina staggered back, holding the stem triumphantly in her hand, and gazing at the deep hole which its roots had left in the soil.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study related to operational {{analyses of the}} apron road system of the São Paulo International Airport, in Guarulhos. The {{results of the study}} were considered in the updating process of the Airport Master Plan. The proposed method of analysis encompasses five steps, to say: determination of road vehicle operational parameters; selection of level of service criteria for apron road traffic operation; definition of alternative airport configurations and demand scenarios; designation of service and <b>holding</b> areas for <b>apron</b> equipment; traffic flow forecasting related to current and alternative configurations and scenarios. Special consideration had to be given to the determination of apron vehicle parameters, once they are not available in the literature, given their specific physical and operational characteristics. Field data was collected and treated to fulfill these needs. The paper presents procedures and results of the performed analyses, as well as the recommended configuration of the apron road system to fit the updated version of the Guarulhos Airport Master Plan...|$|R
60|$|Once upon a time--but {{whether in}} the time past or time to come {{is a matter of}} little or no moment--this wide world had become so {{overburdened}} with an accumulation of worn-out trumpery, that the inhabitants determined to rid themselves of it by a general bonfire. The site fixed upon at the representation of the insurance companies, and as being as central a spot as any other on the globe, was one of the broadest prairies of the West, where no human habitation would be endangered by the flames, and where a vast assemblage of spectators might commodiously admire the show. Having a taste for sights of this kind, and imagining, likewise, that the illumination of the bonfire might reveal some profundity of moral truth heretofore hidden in mist or darkness, I made it convenient to journey thither and be present. At my arrival, although the heap of condemned rubbish was as yet comparatively small, the torch had already been applied. Amid that boundless plain, in the dusk of the evening, like a far off star alone in the firmament, there was merely visible one tremulous gleam, whence none could have anticipated so fierce a blaze as was destined to ensue. With every moment, however, there came foot-travellers, women <b>holding</b> up their <b>aprons,</b> men on horseback, wheelbarrows, lumbering baggage-wagons, and other vehicles, great and small, and from far and near, laden with articles that were judged fit for nothing but to be burned.|$|R
6000|$|Of Thome's other habits, {{she said}} that he always behaved with the strictest propriety, only that he pressed {{her to go to}} Elfland with him, and took <b>hold</b> of her <b>apron</b> as if to pull her along. Again, she said she had seen him in public places, both in the churchyard at Dalry and on the street of Edinburgh, where he walked about among other people, and handled goods that were exposed to sale, without {{attracting}} any notice. She herself did not then speak to him, for it was his command that, upon such occasions, she should never address him unless he spoke first to her. In his theological opinions, Mr. Reid appeared to lean to the Church of Rome, which, indeed, was most indulgent to the fairy folk. He said that the new law, i.e., the Reformation, was not good, and that the old faith should return again, but not exactly as it had been before. Being questioned why this visionary sage attached himself to her more than to others, the accused person replied, that when she was confined in childbirth of one of her boys, a stout woman came into her hut, and sat down on a bench by her bed, like a mere earthly gossip; that she demanded a drink, and was accommodated accordingly; and thereafter told the invalid that the child should die, but that her husband, who was then ailing, should recover. This visit seems to have been previous to her meeting Thome Reid near Monkcastle garden, for that worthy explained to her that her stout visitant was Queen of Fairies, and that he had since attended her by the express command of that lady, his queen and mistress. This reminds us of the extreme doting attachment which the Queen of the Fairies is represented to have taken for Dapper in [...] "The Alchemist." [...] Thome Reid attended her, it would seem, on being summoned thrice, and appeared to her very often within four years. He often requested her to go with him on his return to Fairyland, and when she refused, he shook his head, and said she would repent it.|$|R
