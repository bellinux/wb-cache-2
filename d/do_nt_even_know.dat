25|$|One of Microsoft's biggest {{advances}} initially {{developed for}} Windows NT {{was a new}} 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, {{and from then on}} Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. The Win32 API had three levels implementations: the complete one for Windows NT, a subset for Chicago (originally called Win32c) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and Unicode support, and a more limited subset called Win32s which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows <b>NT,</b> <b>even</b> though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.|$|R

The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required, in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The implementation is verifie <b>do</b> <b>ntest</b> cases by comparison with either exact solutions or ones computed by the Finite Element method...|$|R
