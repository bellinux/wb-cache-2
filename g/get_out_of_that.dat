25|$|The {{reasoning}} is increased activity leads to increased learning, {{which leads to}} lower costs, {{which can lead to}} lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed that if you cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you should <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> business and concentrate your resources where you can take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed product portfolio techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.|$|E

[...] The camera emphasizes his own relationship with Pam, and why he went through with the jinx all day.|$|E
500|$|At first, Henson's Muppets {{appeared}} {{separately from}} the realistic segments on the Street, but after a poor test-screening in Philadelphia, the show was revamped to integrate the two, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Though Henson would often downplay his role in Sesame Street’s success, Cooney frequently praised Jim's work and, in 1990, the Public Broadcasting Service called him [...] "the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service." [...] The success of Sesame Street also allowed Henson to stop producing commercials. He later remembered that [...] "it was a pleasure to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> world".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical {{look at the}} {{universe}} and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of [...] "wonderment" [...] with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes {{and looked at the}} world for the first time. With NME, she further clarified that the lyrics convey the feeling of being small in comparison to the vast universe. It also talks about how regular life goes on faster [...] "than the speeding light", but one can <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> journey and look at themselves with an outsider's perspective.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will come back {{at the beginning of a}} circle, although you have tried to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> particular circle." ...|$|E
500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to me, had I not resolved to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E

Beyoncé could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about {{the sound of her}} music. For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold off and you realize it's a surprise party for you." ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me when I thought I'd better <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E
500|$|In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior {{shooting}} guard Derrick Miller {{to start the}} second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. [...] "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what we <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," [...] Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 9879 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.|$|E

500|$|So many Southern Rhodesians were {{withdrawn}} from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace {{those who had been}} commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the [...] "big push" [...] of 1 July 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which began on 14 July. This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade's first engagement, and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by Sir BH Liddell Hart as [...] "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". [...] "God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again," [...] a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; [...] "at times I wished it would come fast, anything to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> terrible death-trap and murderous place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos {{described}} in a 1990 article in the LA Times how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a [...] "landing station" [...] on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, [...] "capsule" [...] it, and {{send it back to}} Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, [...] "If you can <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set.

2500|$|Sonya's stalker was {{revealed}} to be her old school friend Erin Rogers (Adrienne Pickering). Erin broke into Sonya's home and admitted to sending the letters because she blamed Sonya for introducing her to drugs, which ruined her life. Morey commented, [...] "Erin represents {{what could have happened}} to Sonya if she didn't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> life." [...] After Erin was arrested, Toadie warned her to stay away from his family, while Sonya felt so guilty she paid Erin's bail. Sonya then vowed to make amends with Erin and helped her get a job at The Waterhole, but after Brennan exposed Erin as Sonya's stalker, she lost the job leaving Sonya [...] "to pick up the pieces once again". On Christmas Day, Sonya began thinking about how Erin would be spending the holiday, which prompted Brennan to find her the address of Erin's squat. Sonya visited Erin with some food, but Erin told her to leave as she did not need her charity. Sonya then made it clear that she would be there for Erin when she needed her.|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
