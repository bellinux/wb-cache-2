5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to the}} player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as <b>he</b> <b>lands.</b> The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will {{do whatever is necessary}} to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the human race.|$|E

5|$|Back in Tokyo after Shishio's defeat, Yahiko notices Yukishiro Enishi's revenge {{plot against}} Kenshin. Sensing his own {{inability}} to help, he trains {{much harder to}} learn the two succession techniques in Kamiya Kasshin-ryū. Such moves allow him to block an opponent's attack and then hit him with his weapon. He successfully learns both of this techniques and becomes so adept at using them, that Yahiko starts performing several variations. He uses these moves against one of Enishi's partners Otowa Hyōko and defeats him. While Yahiko rests from to his injuries, Kaoru is kidnapped by Enishi, and Yahiko and his friends start searching for her. When another of Enishi's comrades, Kujiranami Hyōgo escapes from jail and goes on a rampage, Yahiko stands up against him. However, he is not strong enough on his own to defeat him and Kenshin saves him at the last moment. After he and Kenshin recover from their fight injuries, they go to rescue Kaoru from Enishi. While on his island fortress, Yahiko defeats {{one of the four}} bodyguards from Enishi's partner, Heishin, and witnesses Kenshin's fight against Enishi, which Kenshin wins.

One day Kenshin calls him to test his skills; when <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> a hit on Kenshin, he gives Yahiko his own reverse-blade sword as a sign that he has become a true samurai.|$|E
5|$|Gonsales is a Spaniard {{forced to}} flee the country after killing {{a man in a}} duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry {{substantial}} loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting {{what appears to be a}} utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. <b>He</b> <b>lands</b> in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when <b>he</b> <b>lands,</b> the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

25|$|The {{driver is}} {{positioned}} centered—faced down; this position offers greater protection {{to the driver}} during combat, while reducing any chance of injury whenever Batman uses the ejection seat. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, sent to meet Batman as <b>he</b> <b>lands.</b> The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles.

25|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the government in}} Macau is challenged by a merchant, Pedro Velho, who seeks rapprochement with the Chinese. A clever ruse by the governor and his accomplices makes Velho leave the colony for the hinterland. Pilar, the daughter of governor Farria by a Chinese woman, flees a forced marriage and is thought to take refuge in a Dominican monastery. Camões's ship is wrecked {{off the coast of}} Macau, and when <b>he</b> <b>lands,</b> still holding his epic poem, Camões ends up in the garden home of a ruined estate where he discovers Pilar. A vision of his Portuguese lover merges with the half-Chinese woman, who is living as a Chinese in the house of her former nurse. Pilar helps Camões recover his health, but when he leaves to investigate a fire (the governor had the monastery burned down) he is arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins in}} 2020 when North Korean forces led by General Ri-Chan Kyong {{take control of}} the Lingshan Islands. A team of American {{civilian}} archaeologists, led by Dr. Rosenthal, send out a distress call indicating that they have discovered something that could change the world. Thus Raptor Team is dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under code names); they are outfitted with Nanosuits, which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a high-altitude jump onto one of the islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad's suit remotely, restoring its normal function.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} inconsistency {{is introduced}} with Tik-Tok of Oz: Hank the Mule cannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although <b>he</b> <b>lands</b> {{on the shore}} of Ev first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be because Tik-Tok of Oz was originally a stageplay version of Ozma of Oz; Dorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for Dorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more convincingly be played by two people in a costume. Hank probably could not talk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character, in the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to the part of Dorothy's cow Imogene, Toto's replacement on stage in the immensely successful 1903 Broadway version of The Wizard of Oz, a success that Baum sought to duplicate {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
