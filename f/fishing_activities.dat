5|$|The Antarctic scallop is {{monitored}} {{in connection with}} the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by vessels that land the scallop as by-catch during their <b>fishing</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the puffadder shyshark can {{be easily}} caught by hand. Not {{targeted}} by commercial fisheries because of its small size, it is taken incidentally and discarded by bottom trawlers operating between Mossel Bay and East London, and by fishing boats in False Bay. Many are hooked by recreational anglers casting from the shore, who also generally discard or kill them as minor pests. Some local exploitation of this species does occur for lobster bait and the aquarium trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the puffadder shyshark as Near Threatened. Although it remains abundant, the small range of this shark lies entirely within a heavily fished region, and any increase in <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> or habitat degradation could potentially impact the entire population.|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{distribution}} and intensity of inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> is needed to inform marine spatial planning and to assess fisheries interactions with the environment and other industries. Although fishing vessels under 15 m (overall length) account for 98. 4 % (2011 value) {{by the number of}} the European fleet, information on inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> in Europe is very limited as there is no statutory satellite monitoring of smaller vessels (< 15 m length before 2012, < 12 m thereafter). Here, we develop, present, and apply a method which uses sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) estimates calculated from fisheries enforcement data to describe {{the distribution}} and intensity of inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> off the coasts of England and Wales. For the larger inshore vessels, the SPUE estimates of activity were validated with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data and showed good agreement at the scale of analysis. <b>Fishing</b> <b>activity</b> estimates from SPUE are presented with an assessment of uncertainty, to account for spatial differences in enforcement activity. Our estimates of the distribution and intensity of inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> and will complement estimates of offshore <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> based on VMS...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, {{bilateral}} ties were characterised {{by trade}} and economic co-operation; {{other areas of}} bilateral co-operation were explored from 2000 onwards. In that year, Vietnam and Malaysia reached an agreement on bilateral efforts on law enforcement and suppressing the trans-national drug trade. In 2004, three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) {{in the areas of}} information technology, education and diplomatic ties, and co-operation-in-general were signed. Bilateral co-operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed, which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries. The MoU also provided for the navies of both countries to prevent Vietnamese fishermen from encroaching into Malaysian waters for <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> as well as to control piracy.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by <b>fishing</b> <b>activities,</b> and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.|$|E
5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977.

5|$|Thereafter, the {{archipelago}} was visited only by fishing ships; its political status was undisputed until 1820, when Colonel David Jewett, an American privateer {{working for the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, informed anchored ships about Buenos Aires' 1816 claim to Spain's territories in the South Atlantic. Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants, in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German-born merchant Luis Vernet permission to conduct <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> and exploit feral cattle in {{the archipelago}}. Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony. Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829, and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers. Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the American warship USS Lexington in 1831, when United States Navy commander Silas Duncan declared {{the dissolution of the}} island's government.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. This paper {{examines}} {{differences and}} changes in <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> among individual ports in a multi-species fishery using shift-share analysis. We describe overall trends in the fishing industry in north-central California and examine {{the extent to which}} different ports have fared differently. Trends in trips, boats, and revenue indicate that the level of <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> has declined dramatically in the region. We investigate whether all ports have been affected equally by this sector-wide decline; and if not, why not what factors make one port better able to support commercial fishing than another? We first identify and rank ports based on changes in <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> over time. We then explore some possible explanations for different levels of <b>fishing</b> <b>activity,</b> such as stock abundance conditions that vary over space, fishing regulations, supply chain issues (concentration of receivers or processors, idiosyncratic issues such as a sudden loss of a major receiver), and local policies including port infrastructure investments). We use a novel application of the shift-share method to perform the analysis. Shift-share, a non-parametric technique for visualizing trends, is a standard tool in regional science for describing changes in local communities, but it has not been applied to fisheries economics or fleet dynamics. Our results find evidence of fishing regulations as a strong driver of port-level <b>fishing</b> <b>activity,</b> and of both complementary and competitive relationships between nearby ports...|$|R

5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of specialized and commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the island}} archipelago of Lofoten and Vestera°len in northern Norway is a critical foundation from which to understand the subsequent spread of commercial fishing across the north Atlantic region during the medieval and early modern period. One little understood aspect of this development {{is the relationship between}} medieval commercial fishing stations (fiskevaer) and earlier <b>fishing</b> <b>activity.</b> In this article, cultural sediment deposits at Langenesværet, Vestera°len, Northern Norway provide an opportunity to examine this relationship and its implications for current historical models of fishing development in northern Norway and the north Atlantic region. Conventional and AMS radiocarbon dating techniques are used to establish a chronology for the deposits, while activities associated with the sediments are characterized using thin-section micromorphology supported by proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE). The results suggest that the site commenced formation as early as ca. 3000 B. C. and that the site was first used for specialized <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> from the early centuries A. D. The medieval commercial fiskevaer settlement at Langenesværet was introduced to an area that had a longstanding tradition of specialised <b>fishing</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R
