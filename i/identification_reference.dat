40|$|Abstract—The use {{of digital}} {{technologies}} in providing {{health care services}} is collectively known as eHealth. Considerable {{progress has been made}} in the development of eHealth services, but concerns over service integration, large scale deployment, and security, integrity and confidentiality of sensitive medical data still need to be addressed. This paper presents a solution proposed by the Data Capture and Auto <b>Identification</b> <b>Reference</b> (DACAR) project to overcoming these challenges. The DACAR platform uses a Single Point of Contact, a rule based information sharing policy syntax and data buckets hosted by a scalable and cost-effective Cloud infrastructure, to allow the secure capture, storage and consumption of sensitive health care data. Currently, a prototype of the DACAR platform has been implemented. To assess the viability and performance of the platform, a demonstration application, namely the Early Warn-ing Score, has been developed and deployed within a private Cloud infrastructure at Edinburgh Napier University. Simulated experimental results show that the end-to-end communication latency of 97. 8 % of application messages were below 100 ms. Hence, the DACAR platform is efficient enough to support the development and integration of time critical eHealth services. A more comprehensive evaluation of the DACAR platform in a real life medical environment is under development at Chelse...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} proved that Sensor Pattern Noise (SPN) can serve as an imaging device {{fingerprint}} for source camera <b>identification.</b> <b>Reference</b> SPN estimation {{is a very important}} procedure within the framework of this application. Most previous works built reference SPN by averaging the SPNs extracted from 50 images of blue sky. However, this method can be problematic. Firstly, in practice we may face the problem of source camera identification {{in the absence of the}} imaging cameras and reference SPNs, which means only natural images with scene details are available for reference SPN estimation rather than blue sky images. It is challenging because the reference SPN can be severely contaminated by image content. Secondly, the number of available reference images sometimes is too few for existing methods to estimate a reliable reference SPN. In fact, existing methods lack consideration of the number of available reference images as they were designed for the datasets with abundant images to estimate the reference SPN. In order to deal with the aforementioned problem, in this work, a novel reference estimator is proposed. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance than the methods based on the averaged reference SPN, especially when few reference images used...|$|E
40|$|URIs, a {{universal}} identification scheme, {{are different from}} human names insofar as they can provide the ability to reliably access the thing identified. URIs also can function to reference a nonaccessible thing {{in a similar manner}} to how names function in natural language. There are two distinctly different relationships between names and things: access and reference. To confuse the two relations leads to underlying problems with Web architecture. Reference is by nature ambiguous in any language. So any attempts by Web architecture to make reference completely unambiguous will fail on the Web. Despite popular belief otherwise, making further ontological distinctions often leads to more ambiguity, not less. Contrary to appeals to Kripke for some sort of eternal and unique <b>identification,</b> <b>reference</b> on the Web uses descriptions and therefore there is no unambiguous resolution of reference. On the Web, what is needed is not just a simple redirection, but a uniform and logically consistent manner of associating descriptions with URIs that can be done in a number of practical ways that should be made consistent. THE IDENTITY CRISIS ON THE WEB One might imagine {{that there would be no}} problems of identification on the Web. After all, the Web seems to be about identifying and accessing web pages.

The absence of laboratory testing <b>identification</b> <b>references</b> against this patient's name led to police visiting the man who readily disclosed that he had AIDS and that he had been called in for a blood test by Dr Schmidt on the evening in question. The forensic challenge at that point was to match the DNA from the virus itself from the patient to the victim, something that had never been done before. HIV DNA was collected from the victim, from the putative patient source, and from thirty-two other unrelated, HIV-positive individuals living in the same metropolitan area. Scientists concluded that of all the samples they tested, the two viruses' DNA from the victim and the patient matched almost exactly, even with HIV's potential to mutate very rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Revealing {{diversity}} among extant blood flukes, and {{the patterns of}} relationships among them, hits been hindered by the difficulty of determining if specimens described from different life cycle stages, hosts, geographic localities, and times represent the Same or different species. Persistent collection of all available life cycle stages and provision of exact collection localities, host <b>identification,</b> <b>reference</b> DNA sequences for the parasite, and voucher specimens eventually will provide the framework needed to piece together individual life cycles and facilitate reconciliation with classical taxonomic descriptions, including those based oil single life cycle Stages. It also provides a means to document unique or rare species that might only ever be recovered From a single life cycle stage. With {{an emphasis on the}} value of new information from field collections of any available life cycle stages, here we provide data For several blood fluke cercariae from freshwater snails from Kenya, Uganda, and Australia. Similar data are provided for adult worms of Macrobilharzia macrobilharzia and miracidia of Bivitellobilliarzia nairi. Some schistosome and sanguinicolid cercariae that we recovered have peculiar morphological features, and our phylogenetic analyses (18 S and 28 S rDNA and mtDNA CO 1) suggest that 2 of the new schistosome specimens likely represent previously unknown lineages. Our results also provide new insights into 2 of the 4 remaining schistosome genera yet to be extensively characterized with respect to their position in molecular phylogenies, Macrobilharzia and Bivitellobilharzio.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the number of}} {{imported}} leishmaniasis cases has increased in countries of Western Europe. The trend is associated with increasing travels, ecotourism activity, military operations and immigration. While in endemic countries leishmaniasis is usually well diagnosed, accurate patient history and parasite identification are necessary to distinguish between autochthonous and imported cases. This is particularly important, as new Leishmania species/genotypes may be introduced and transmitted by local phlebotomine vectors without appropriate surveillance, with unpredictable consequences. We report on the surveillance of imported leishmaniasis performed by the Leishmania <b>Identification</b> <b>Reference</b> Centre of Rome from 1986 through 2012, involving health care centres from 16 / 20 Italian regions. Suspected imported cases were analyzed and conclusions were based on clinical, epidemiological and diagnostic findings. Over the years, different parasite identification methods were employed, including MultiLocus Enzyme Electrophoresis and molecular techniques combining disease diagnosis (SSU rDNA nested-PCR) and Leishmania typing (nuclear repetitive sequence and ITS- 1 PCR-RFLPs). A total of 105 imported cases were recorded (annual range: 0 - 20) of which 36 were visceral (VL) (16 HIV-coinfections) and 69 cutaneous (CL) cases; 85 cases (52 CL) were from the Old World and 20 (17 CL) from the New World. Eight Leishmania species were identified, of which 7 were exotic to Italy. VL importation until 1995 {{was associated with the}} spread of Mediterranean Leishmania-HIV co-infections in early 1990 s. Following the introduction of HAART treatment, such cases became occasional in Italians but relatively frequent among immigrants. In contrast, a steady increase of CL cases was observed from different areas of the Old and New Worlds, that in recent years included mainly immigrants 'visiting friends and relatives' and Italian tourists. This positive trend likely depends on better diagnosis and reporting; however, we suspect that many CL cases remained unrecognized. Given the relatively low incidence of leishmaniasis importation, the risk of introduction of exotic parasites appears limited, although the detection of anthroponotic species requires attention...|$|E
40|$|Entity {{matching}} {{also known}} as entity resolution, duplicate <b>identification,</b> <b>reference</b> reconciliation or record linkage and is a critically important task for data cleaning and data integration. One can think of it, as the task of finding entities matching to the same entity in the real world. These entities can belong to a single source of data, or distributed data-sources. It takes structured data as an input and process includes comparison of that structured data (entity or database record) with entities present in the knowledge base. For large-scale entity, matching data {{has to go through}} some sequence of steps, which includes Evaluation, Preprocessing, Candidate calculation and Classification. The entity matching workflow consists of two strategies: blocking (map) and matching (reduce). Blocking strategy termed as the division of a data source into partitions or blocks. Blocking is helpful to improve performance. Blocking achieves this goal restricting the set of similar entities in the same partition or block and then, comparing the same within blocks. The partitioning makes use of blocking keys and blocking keys are determined from entity 2 ̆ 7 s attributes. Partitioning helps to partition data into blocks. Values of one or several attributes form the blocking key. Mostly, the blocking key is concatenation of prefixes of these attributes. The second part of the workflow consists of the strategy for matching. This aims to identify all matching entity pairs within the same partition. To find out matching result, one need to realize comparison result of the pair of entities. A matching strategy can use several approaches for matching and can combine similarity scores to find if the entity pair is a match or not. The entity-matching model expects the matching strategy to return the list of matching pairs of entities. Thus, by relating the structured data with their most apposite entity, entity matching tries to gain the maximum out of the existing knowledge base. One of the best solutions for Entity Matching would be Dedoop [4], which is Deduplication of Hadoop. Cartesian product causes the workload due to execution with the time complexity of O (n 2) and to provide more time for matching techniques to maintain the quality, some load balancing techniques are necessary. Even after the application of blocking, the task of matching i. e. Entity Matching can still be a costly task and can take up to several days for completion if running against large datasets. The MapReduce [2] programming model is perfect to execute EM in parallel. During execution, input file split into multiple parts or chunks. Then, map phase, multiple map tasks can read those parts in parallel, which are nothing but entities. During reduce phase, based on blocking keys, these entities are redistributed among several reduce tasks. This is helpful for grouping together entities with the same blocking key and can be helpful for the application of matching in parallel...|$|E

The study involved 67 deaf adolescents (38 boys and 29 girls aged 16 to 19 students of secondary school). Ninety-three hearing children constituted a comparison group. The structure of identity was explored on the basis of <b>identification</b> <b>references</b> given by the subjects who were to reply in writing, 20 times running, to the question: „Who Am I?” the test, adapted from M. H. Kuhn and T. S. McPartland by Martines and Silvestre (1995) given in written and signed mode. Results showed that the hearing status as well as mode of communication influence the description of personal identity. It was found that deaf adoles­cents used more descriptions especially in the fol­lowing categories: Civil Status, Body and Physical Appearance, Tastes and Activities, Friendship and Relationships, Personal and Social Situation, Negative Personal Traits, and Neutral Personality Traits. Although this study could demonstrate im­pact independent variables on identity, the data raise the need for further, preferably longitudinal, research. This complex phenomenon has to be examined more closely.
