50|$|The turtles are {{now ready}} {{to return to their}} own time, but Mikey says he'd rather stay (in {{particular}} because he wanted to be with Mitsu). Raphael decides he wants to stay as well because he feels like the Turtles are appreciated in Japan unlike back home. The other turtles and April try to convince them otherwise until Kenshin activates the scepter and makes the decision harder. After a long debate (which included Mitsu telling Mikey to keep his promise about Kenshin returning to the past), Michelangelo reluctantly agrees to go home with his brothers, but just barely misses grabbing the scepter in time. The Honor <b>Guards</b> <b>switch</b> back with the Turtles (all except for Michelangelo). Fortunately, the last remaining Honor Guard activates the scepter and swaps places with Mikey just before the scepter burns out.|$|R

There {{he became a}} cadet officer at the Haile Selassie I Cadet School and was training Ethiopian youths to be officers in Emperor Haile Selassie's Imperial Guards. In 1951, Nauclér and the Swede Orvar Nilsson was commissioned into the Kagnew Battalion which {{was going to be}} deployed in Korea. Both Nauclér and Nilsson had twice previously been granted temporary leave from the Swedish Army to serve first in the Winter War and then the Continuation War, but were now denied. Instead, they asked for dismissal from the Swedish service, which was immediately granted. They were both hired as majors in Emperor Haile Selassie's Imperial <b>Guard,</b> <b>switched</b> to Ethiopian uniforms and flew by private plane carried by an Ethiopian pilot to Djibouti, where they joined the battalion as advisers. The journey from Djibouti, via Bangkok to Pusan in the American troopship [...] took three weeks. It arrived in the Port of Pusan in the morning 6 May 1951, where the South Korean President Syngman Rhee and representatives of the UN forces in Korea were waiting.

During {{the course of the}} story, the extraterrestrial Tachyon is teleported onto the station, by scientist James Holmes, with whom Tachyon bonds. Dot, a spy with the power to shrink, sneaks aboard the station on a government mission. Circus acrobat Polestar stows away after a romantic interlude with a space shuttle pilot, while Avalon, Holmes' teenage witch daughter, and her boyfriend, the telekinetically powered Impulse, are brought there by the CEO to use as leverage against Holmes. Megabyte, one of the CEO's robot <b>guards,</b> <b>switches</b> sides and assists the others to foil the CEO's plot. After deciding to stay together as a team, issues 7 - 9 depicted the team traveling to the mystical realm of Avalon, during which the titular character's mother is revealed to be the Lady of the Lake of Arthurian legend. Subsequent single issues focused on The Volunteers, a group of superhumans with ties to Dot, Polestar's life in the circus, a [...] "very special issue" [...] about teen pregnancy, and Tachyon's sense of alienation.|$|R

But after two minutes, Matthew Hartmann scored the first {{goal of the}} half. Chad Gould subbed {{in the game and}} scored a goal from a free kick at the 48th minute. The scoreline reached 17-0. Gould scored 6 more goals, 3 goals each by Jake Morallo and James Younghusband, and 1 goal each by Simon Greatwich and Matthew Hartmann. Phil Younghusband finished the game by scoring in the 90th minute and in the final minute.|$|R
50|$|The Armory was {{designed}} by prominent area architect James H. Gow, originally in a design {{that was meant to}} be made of brick. However, cost-cutting measures led the <b>Guard</b> to <b>switch</b> the building to a free and plentiful local resource, cobblestone, which would make the building more distinctive and famous. 3,300 wagonloads weighing 6,600 tons were hauled by Lawrence W. Billis from Clear Creek to this site, and as it rose some locals predicted it would collapse. However, it has remained standing for over 90 years to this day.|$|R

50|$|He {{can play}} at either the point guard or {{shooting}} guard position. He spent {{the early part}} of his club EuroLeague career playing as a shooting <b>guard,</b> and then <b>switched</b> to the point guard position later in his club career. In the senior men's Spanish national team, he has mainly played at the shooting guard position.|$|R
50|$|The {{multi-mode}} switch {{consists of}} three settings: Off, Signal, and On. When the switch is set to Signal, the user is able to press and hold a button located just above the switch to turn the light on, and it will switch off again when the button is released. This allows users to signal using Morse code. When the switch is moved up to the On position, the flashlight remains on without any further user interaction. The modern MX-991/U also features a <b>switch</b> <b>guard</b> which was not present in previous variants as issued in the Vietnam War. The <b>switch</b> <b>guard</b> was suggested as an improvement from soldiers during the war, and later added to prevent unintentional operation of the flashlight. This helped to prevent soldiers from accidentally giving their position away in the dark should equipment, clothing etc press the signal button or move the switch.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Mount Vernon, New York, Cousins {{was only a}} two-star {{prospect}} out of high school.

As a senior, Cousins paired with Buddy Hield to lead the Sooners to the Final Four while averaging 12.6 points, 4.5 assists and 1.4 steals per game. He earned third-team All-Big 12 honors.|$|R
5000|$|He {{served in}} the Confederate States Army in the Louisiana Native Guards during the Civil War. The unit was {{originally}} raised by the Confederates from the sizable free black population of New Orleans who volunteered their services. It was disbanded and reconstituted a few times as the Confederate government {{did not know what}} to do with the troops, until New Orleans was captured by Union forces. Officers of the Guard were partly composed of free black soldiers from New Orleans and the surrounding area. Morris served among them as a lieutenant. After the fall of New Orleans, some of the Confederate Louisiana <b>Guard</b> promptly <b>switched</b> allegiances to the Union, and its officers became the first black officers in the Union Army.|$|R
5000|$|After the Armistice Agreement {{was signed}} in Korea, the Ohio Guard's focus {{returned}} to its state mission and reorganization in accordance with federal mandates. Significant challenges were met by the continuing changes and advances in technology which required a flexible and better educated force. World events also continued to impact the Ohio Guard. The Berlin Crisis of 1961 resulted in the mobilization of ten Ohio Air and Army National Guard units to help counter the Soviet threat. It was during this period that the Ohio <b>Guard's</b> units <b>switched</b> over to the new Reorganisation Objective Army Division (ROAD) framework directed by the Department of Defense. Most notable among these changes was the deactivation of the storied 37th [...] "Buckeye" [...] Division on February 15, 1968.

50|$|Geldron: The boss of Jolty Jungle. Geldron {{resembles a}} large crab with no claws, a pumpkin colored head with 2 yellow eyes, a purple {{underside}} {{with the boss}} symbol and 4 blue legs with turquoise knees and feet that resemble claws. He attacks using his feet to smash Dewy and by extending a large green drop of slime to grab Dewy. If this happens, the player must shake the wiimote to break free. He is defeated when Dewy first pulls him down from the ceiling and smashes his eyes. He then flips up onto his back and <b>guards</b> the <b>switches</b> used to flip him over. The platform Dewy and Geldron battle on breaks apart as the battle proceeds. Upon being defeated, Geldron screams and retracts his eyes and claws before flying all over the place. He then smashes into the ceiling and becomes as flat as a pancake. On his underside, a large bud opens up to reveal a flower.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we propose an {{approximation}} scheme to trans-form a general stochastic hybrid system (SHS) into a SHS without forced transitions due to spatial <b>guards.</b> Such <b>switching</b> mechanisms are re-placed by spontaneous transitions with state-dependent transition in-tensities (jump rates). The resulting switching diffusion process with random hybrid jumps {{is shown to}} converge in distribution to the origi-nal stochastic hybrid system execution. The obtained approximation can be useful for various purposes such as, on the computational side, simula-tion and reachability analysis, {{as well as for}} the theoretical investigation of the model. More generally, it is suggested that SHS which are en-dowed exclusively with random jumping events are simpler than those that present spatial forcing transitions. In the opening of this work, the general SHS model is presented, a few of its basic properties are discussed, and the concept of generator is introduced. The second part of the paper describes the approximation procedure, introduces the new SHS model, and proves, under some as-sumptions, its weak convergence to the original system. We describe the general stochastic hybrid system model introduced in [1]...|$|R
5000|$|Sokol Baci (1828-1920) [...] was {{the chief}} of the Gruda, a {{northern}} Albanian tribe in the vicinity of Podgorica (now Montenegro). Originally, he had served the Ottoman sultan in his personal <b>guard,</b> but <b>switched</b> sides after he was maltreated, and fought the Ottoman forces in the Sanjak of Scutari. After his clan was defeated and subjugated, he was exiled and sought refuge in Montenegro, even though he had earlier fought against them in the 1870s, and lived in Podgorica beginning in approximately 1884. Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro recognized his status and employed him. He was {{one of the leaders of}} the Albanian Revolt of 1911, alongside chiefs such as Ded Gjo Luli, Mehmet Shpëndi, Mirash Luca and Luigj Gurakuqi. In 1912, the entire tribes of Gruda and Hoti, along with major portions of the Kastrati, Shkreli, and Klimenti tribes, backed Montenegro during the Balkan Wars. In 1913, he was appointed commander of Scutari by King Nicholas I of Montenegro, where he lived until his death in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|When the vans {{reached the}} camp, they emptied their {{passengers}} who were {{taken over by}} the S.S. guards. These began to drive them, cursing and swearing, beating them on their backs with their truncheons, into a hut where they were to pass the night without having had a meal. The hut was divided into two sections, one for men, one for women. It was separated from the main lager by a barbed-wire fence. Altogether, the lager held at that moment, about three hundred men, women and children. The beds were iron frames arranged in a double tier, without mattresses of any kind. Our prisoners threw themselves on the bare springs trying to snatch a few minutes sleep; but few slept that night, if only because the <b>guards</b> kept <b>switching</b> the lights off and on, from time to time, as a precaution against attempts to escape, which was next to impossible in any case. Their cold harsh voices filled the prisoners with anxiety about the future and, in these circumstances, it is anxiety which can turn a prison into a hell on earth.|$|R

[...] These claims were disputed by senior British officers. A 2004 report in The Guardian cited senior UK military and intelligence sources saying that British Admiral Michael Boyce told his commanders to negotiate with senior Iraqi Army and Republican <b>Guard</b> officers to <b>switch</b> sides and operate under UK guidance to uphold law and order, but that CPA orders 1 and 2 effectively destroyed any chance to regroup the Iraqi forces for such a plan.|$|R
50|$|All {{multiple}} unit trains have local door switches, located in various locations. These are always located on cab doors {{which can be}} locked for security. Most of the rest are located on door control panels and require the Guard open their local door and step onto the platform before opening the remaining passenger doors, thus making sure their train is accommodated correctly on the platform. In some cases, where the driver releases the doors, the <b>Guard</b> uses a <b>switch</b> to isolate their door from the rest to prevent it closing when the other passenger doors are closed. The Guard will observe the doors closing, and is required {{to remain on the}} platform until all doors are closed and it is safe to proceed. They will then will close their door before starting the train.|$|R

For the reachability analysis of the continuous dynamics, we use an efficient approximation algorithm based on zonotopes. In order to use this technique for the analysis of hybrid systems, we must also deal with the discrete transitions in a satisfactory (i. e. scalable and accurate) way. For that purpose, we need to approximate the intersection of the continuous reachable sets with the guards enabling the discrete transitions. The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm for computing efficiently a tight over-approximation of the intersection of (possibly high-order) zonotopes with a hyperplane.

50|$|There is {{a window}} for each cell {{designed}} for lower-ranking prisoners. The area of the window is around one square meter, located more than two meters above the ground. The windowsill is sloped upward with window opens upward toward outside, but of course, prisoners are unable to open the window themselves. There are three layers for every window: screen, iron fence, and glass painted white. In the cells for high-ranking prisoners, there are two windows but the outermost layer is sanded glass instead of glass painted white. Prisoners could neither see the courtyard nor any other buildings, but some could see the mountain and sun from their cells. A 15-watt light bulb with sanded glass is on the 3.5 meter high ceiling, and it is covered by iron mesh, and the dim light is controlled by <b>guards</b> via a <b>switch</b> outside.|$|R

40|$|Oracle Data Guard is the management, monitoring, and {{automation}} {{software infrastructure}} that creates, maintains, and monitors {{one or more}} standby databases to protect enterprise data from failures, disasters, errors, and data corruptions. Data Guard maintains standby databases as consistent copies of the production database as far as transactions are concerned. These standby databases can be located at remote disaster recovery sites {{thousands of miles away}} from the production data center, or they may be located in the same city, same campus, or even in the same building. If the production database becomes unavailable because of a planned or an unplanned outage, Data <b>Guard</b> can <b>switch</b> any standby database to the production role, thus minimizing the downtime associated with the outage, andpreventing any data loss.

40|$|Constant-rate {{multi-mode}} {{systems are}} hybrid systems that can switch freely among a finite set of modes, and whose dynamics is specified by {{a finite number}} of real-valued variables with mode-dependent constant rates. The schedulability problem for such systems is to design a mode-switching policy that maintains the state within a specified safety set. The main result of the paper is that schedulability can be decided in polynomial time. We also generalize our result to optimal schedulability problems with average cost and reachability cost objectives. Polynomial-time scheduling algorithms make this class an appealing formal model for design of energy-optimal policies. The key to tractability is that the only constraints on when a scheduler can switch the mode are specified by global objectives. Adding local constraints by associating either invariants with modes, or <b>guards</b> with mode <b>switches,</b> lead to undecidability, and requiring the scheduler to make decisions only at multiples of a given sampling rate, leads to a PSPACE-complete schedulability problem...|$|R
