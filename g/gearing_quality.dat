40|$|AbstractGear hobbing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} manufacturing processes for cylindrical <b>gears.</b> The <b>quality</b> of the <b>gears</b> is a result of the tool quality, the precision of the workpiece, tool clamping and kinematics of the machine. The dry gear hobbing process allows machining of <b>gears</b> with a <b>quality</b> according to the DIN standard of up to IT 5. To evaluate which <b>gear</b> <b>quality</b> is possible to machine with a given clamping and hob it is useful to simulate the process in advance. This is also an opportunity to order the required quality of the hob according to its application. The objective presented in this paper is to simulate non-ideal gear hobbing processes and to calculate the geometry and topography of the workpiece. To achieve this goal, a simulation for continuous gear hobbing was developed. By calculating planar intersections of transverse sections of both gear and tool, the resulting gear geometry is determined. Beside it is possible to calculate different characteristic values for the hobbing process such as chip thickness and cutting volume. By an evaluation of tool and clamping tolerances these deviations can be used to modify the simulation model. Afterwards a non-ideal hobbing simulation can be performed and the resulting gear geometry can be analyzed using a virtual measurement machine. An advantage of this non-ideal simulation is also the possibility of calculating the tool load taking these deviations into account and to use the results for further process designs to reduce the risk of tool failure. The virtual measurement machine analyses the geometry according to VDI/VDE  2612 / 2607 and DIN  3961. The resulting measurements of the flank and lead lines can be used for a classification of the <b>gear</b> <b>quality.</b> By using this simulation program it is possible to reduce the costs and time effort of setting up a new hobbing process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grinding is a {{final step}} in the {{production}} chain of gears and therefore determines {{the quality of the}} product. In the industrial practice gears are cut- generally by means of a hobbing process- and their surface is hardened through a heat treatment, which has the target of increasing the wear resistance of the tooth flanks. Grinding is therefore necessary to remove the material distortions originating during the heat treatment and to fulfill dimensional and quality requirements. Usually only <b>gears</b> with high <b>quality</b> requirements are ground. Otherwise grinding is not carried out to reduce the production costs. In the recent years however the percentage of ground gears has been growing continuously due to the rising demands on load capacity, quiet running and life time as well as the increasing performance offered by the grinding processes. Generating grinding by means of cylindrical grinding worms shows the highest potential among the existing processes for gear grinding due to the high material removal performance that can be achieved. In order to use dressable worms efficiently the dressing technology has to be optimized. The present contribution describes the technology for dressing vitreous bonded grinding worms. This process is based on the use of form dressing rollers by means of which the grinding worm geometry and topography are generated. The investigations are aimed at analyzing the influence of the dressing parameters, in particular the speed ratio between dressing and grinding tool, and the attainable <b>gear</b> <b>quality</b> and surface properties. The results show significant dependencies between the dressing strategy and the grinding results...|$|R

40|$|Gears {{are used}} to {{transmit}} mechanical workfrom one point to another. They are widely used in different mechanisms {{and they are the}} most important components of a transmission system. Thus, it is important that they are manufactured with high precision to deliver the work with highest possible efficiency. The dominant gear production method is metal cutting, like hobbing. The gear manufacturing industry aims to replace their traditional production lines with greener processes and thereby urge engineers to think about using metal forming methods instead of the traditional metal cutting solutions when possible. Gear rolling is an interesting metal forming method that can be an alternative method to fabricate gear wheels. Research on gear rolling firstly came into interest around 2000. Very few papers are published that covers the development of the method and its limitations and advantages. Almost all of these publications considered rolling of gear wheels with small modules. The focus of this study will be on application of gear rolling for gear wheels with large module (over 3 mm) where the amount of deformation is much larger than found in previous studies. In this thesis the Finite Element Method has been used to simulate and predict the results of rolling of high gears. In addition to that experiments were performed to validate the numerical results and develop the modelling technique for further investigations. The main topic of discussion is about the <b>gear</b> <b>quality</b> as a measure of the success for the process. Extra {{attention has been paid to}} the effects of friction and process planning in the result of process loads and also on the <b>gear</b> <b>quality.</b> The thesis structure is based on four published papers, and some additional results from the experiments which have not yet been published. According to the results of these papers, the effect of friction and process parameters are recognized in the final product quality. It is shown that FEM has a great potential in order to model and analyze the gear rolling process. A new approach to combine numerical methods with quality measurement to predict the process outcomes is also presented. The results show that gear wheels with a module of 4 mm reach an ISO quality level between 11 and 12. This is substantially lower quality than can be obtained with metal cutting operations. The results of this thesis can be used as the starting point for future research to optimize the <b>quality</b> of <b>gear</b> rolling for high gears. QC 20150914 </p...|$|R
