However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater <b>inflows</b> have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater <b>inflows</b> into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E

40|$|The present {{experimental}} study demonstrates {{the effects of}} clean and distorted <b>inflow</b> conditions on the performance and nature of stall inception in a single stage axial flow fan. A 90 degrees distortion screen located upstream of the rotor leading edge was rotated up to 40 per cent of the rotor speed in the clockwise (co-rotation) and counterclockwise (counter-rotation) directions to generate dynamic <b>inflow</b> distortion. It was observed that the stall margin deteriorated substantially under co-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortion as compared to counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortion. The degradation in stall margin was about 15 per cent and 1. 98 per cent under co- and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions, respectively. Tip injection {{was used as a}} means of enhancing the fan performance under distorted <b>inflow.</b> With tip injection under co-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortion, about 2. 8 per cent improvement in stall margin was observed. The improvement in stall margin under counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortion with tip injection was 2. 98 per cent. The unsteady static pressure traces show clear differences in the nature of stall inception under co-and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions. The stall inception occurs through long-length-scale disturbances under co-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortion, while the mode of stall inception under clean flow and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions was through short-length-scale disturbances. The nature of stall inception under dynamic <b>inflow</b> distortion with tip injection remains the same as without tip injection...|$|R

Temporal trends in these <b>inflow</b> rates are an important basis for evaluating changes in PFOS and PFOA emissions in the Tokyo Bay catchment basin. A mixing model estimated the average concentrations of these compounds in the freshwater <b>inflow</b> to the bay, which were then multiplied by estimated freshwater <b>inflow</b> rates to obtain the <b>inflow</b> rates of these compounds. The receptor-oriented approach enabled us to comprehensively cover <b>inflow</b> to the bay, including <b>inflow</b> via direct discharge to the bay. On a logarithmic basis, the rate of <b>inflow</b> for PFOS decreased gradually, particularly after 2006, whereas that for PFOA exhibited a marked stepwise decrease from 2006 to 2007. The rate of <b>inflow</b> for PFOS decreased from 730 kg/y during 2004 – 2006 to 160 kg/y in 2010, whereas that for PFOA decreased from 2000 kg/y during 2004 – 2006 to 290 kg/y in 2010. These reductions probably reflected reductions in the use and emission of these compounds and their precursors in the Tokyo Bay catchment basin. Our estimated per-person <b>inflow</b> rates (i. e., <b>inflow</b> rates divided by the estimated population in the basin) for PFOS were generally comparable to previously reported per-person waterborne emission rates in Japan and other countries, whereas those for PFOA were generally higher than previously reported per-person waterborne emission rates.

The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large <b>inflows</b> of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

Unsteady pressure data from wall mounted sensors {{were used in the}} wavelet transforms. This paper was carried out under undistorted and distorted <b>inflow</b> conditions as well as for slow throttle closure and throttle ramping. It was observed from the wavelet transforms that the stall inception under clean <b>inflow</b> (undistorted) and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions (in the direction opposing the rotor rotation) incur through short length-scale disturbances and through long length-scale disturbances under static and co-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions (in the same direction of rotor rotation). Modal activity was observed to be insignificant under clean <b>inflow</b> while under static <b>inflow</b> distortion, long length-scale disturbances evolved due to interaction between rotor blades and the distorted sector, especially near the trailing edge of the distortion screen. The presence of a strong mode was observed under both co- and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions. With throttle ramping, stall inception occurs through long and short length-scale disturbances under co- and counter-rotating <b>inflow</b> distortions, respectively Some preliminary flow characteristics were studied using a seven hole probe.

Methods: The records of 495 patients who underwent 551 infrainguinal bypass grafting procedures were reviewed. Saphenous vein and prosthetic grafts were evaluated separately. Graft patency rates, patient limb salvage rates, and patient survival rates in those grafts that arose from a reconstructed <b>inflow</b> source were compared with those that arose from normal, nonreconstructed <b>inflow</b> sources. When grafts had either hemodynamic failure or occlusion, the cause of failure was identified. Results: Four-year primary patency rates in vein grafts that arose from a reconstructed <b>inflow</b> sources were lower than those in grafts that arose from nonreconstructed <b>inflow</b> sources (41 % vs 54 %; p = 0. 006). Assisted primary patency rates and secondary patency rates, however, were similar (62 % vs 74 % and 64 % vs 77 %, respectively). The 4 -year primary patency rate (45 % vs 55 %), assisted primary patency rate (60 % vs 60 %), and secondary patency rate (60 % vs 61 %) in prosthetic grafts did not vary based on <b>inflow</b> source. The {{most common cause of}} graft failure was <b>inflow</b> failure, except in the vein grafts that did not require an <b>inflow</b> procedure, in which {{the most common cause of}} failure was graft failure. <b>Inflow</b> failure occurred in 24 % and 22 % of the vein and prosthetic grafts with multisegmental disease, respectively, but in only 7 % (p < 0. 001) and 10 % (p < 0. 05), respectively, of those that arose from normal nonreconstructed <b>inflow.</b> The presence of an <b>inflow</b> procedure did not affect limb salvage rates or patient survival rates, regardless of graft material. Conclusions: Long-term patency rates, patient limb salvage rates, and survival rates in patients with a reconstructed <b>inflow</b> source were similar to those of patients with a normal nonreconstructed <b>inflow.</b> A major cause of occlusion is <b>inflow</b> failure, and this occurs in a greater proportion of patients with multisegmental disease.

For 36 patients, geometric models of aneurysms were determined by using 3 D rotational angiography. 2 D phase-contrast MR imaging velocity measurements of the parent artery were performed. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed twice: once by using patient-specific phase-contrast MR imaging velocity profiles and once by using generalized Womersley profiles as <b>inflow</b> boundary conditions. Resulting mean and maximum wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were analyzed, and hemodynamic characteristics were qualitatively compared.
