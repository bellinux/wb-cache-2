In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India {{as it did in the}} United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures.

25|$|A {{complete}} ring {{has much}} simpler structure than a commutative ring.

Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of excellent ring.|$|E

25|$|The {{school has}} nearly 2,000 students, {{exceeding}} its design capacity and resulting in overcrowding {{and many other}} major problems.
