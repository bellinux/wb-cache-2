50|$|Barrish, Saunders, and Wolf (1969) {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Good Behavior Game on reducing out-of-seat behavior and talking-out behavior with 24 fourth-grade students. Seven of the students had been referred by the teacher to the principal for a number of disruptive behaviors. It was also noted that the classroom was lacking a general behavior management plan. Prior to implementation, the teacher presented a short overview of the game to explain the <b>instructional</b> <b>times</b> when the game would be in effect (i.e., math period), rules, and rewards. When the experimental conditions were altered, the teacher provided a new explanation of the change(s). The researchers used a reversal and multiple baseline experimental design with four phases: (1) math baseline and reading baseline, (2) math game and reading baseline, (3) math reversal and reading game, and (4) math game and reading game. The results indicate a significant decrease in disruptive behavior during both math and reading class when the Good Behavior Game was in effect. Talking-out behavior decreased from 96% during baseline to 19% when the game was applied during the math period. Similarly, the students' out-of-seat behavior was reduced from 82% of the scored intervals to 9% during the intervention. Both teams won on all but three occasions. Evidence of generalization and maintenance was not reported.|$|R
25|$|Most Waldorf-inspired {{schools in}} the United States are {{elementary}} schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on standardized tests {{in order to continue}} receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded <b>instructional</b> <b>time</b> for academic subjects.|$|E

40|$|Although {{many people}} in both K- 12 and early {{childhood}} education have written about knowledge and teaching, {{little is known about}} what types of knowledge preschool teachers use to make moment-to-moment instructional decisions. This study responds to the gaps in the literature by exploring early childhood teachers’ pedagogical reasoning about practice in order uncover how teachers report using information to reason about practice. This dissertation study used a phenomenological approach in order to understand early childhood teachers’ pedagogical reasoning. It asked the guiding research question: How do prekindergarten teachers reason during their moment-to-moment instruction? The pedagogical reasoning of eight prekindergarten teachers from two preschools was examined. The teachers had a variety of background experiences. The schools served similar children but each had different learning goals for children and different center-wide structures for delivering content to children. Each teacher was observed and video-recorded four times, twice during circle time and twice during language and literacy instruction. A stimulated recall procedure was used to access teachers’ reasoning about their practice during those <b>instructional</b> <b>times.</b> Participants discussed using six main categories of information to inform their pedagogical reasoning during practice. Across these categories teachers seemed to think a great deal about their students, content (goals and curriculum), and sometimes themselves. They rarely reported using information from outside the instructional context such as information about how young children learn and develop skills. Broader contextual variables such as instructional activity and school setting also seemed to influence teachers’ use of information. Multiple sources of information worked together to inform teachers’ pedagogical reasoning in complex ways that were often not visible from an outside perspective. By focusing on teachers’ perspectives of their work in the classroom, this research complements and expands current early childhood education research and helps the field understand more about the information that teachers use to inform their pedagogical reasoning during practice. The implications of these findings as they relate to what is currently known about early childhood and K- 12 teachers’ uses of knowledge, implications for designing professional learning for teachers of young children, as well as directions for future scholarship are discussed...|$|R
