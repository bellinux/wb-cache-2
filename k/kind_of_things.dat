[...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E

[...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's {{about the end of}} school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

As a consequence, when somebody designs an individual item and classifies it by a particular kind, then all the knowledge and requirements that are known for the supertypes <b>of</b> that <b>kind</b> will also be recognized and can be made available automatically.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> {{that were on the}} album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E
500|$|Manor Marussia's Alexander Rossi {{was delighted}} with his result in twelfth, {{feeling that it}} could be [...] "the start of great things", after he had equalled the team's best result of the season. Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The bottom line of this is that these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. We are much better than this." ...|$|E

[...] Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.|$|E

Their crowdfunding success has, however, granted them enough independence to be more selective about the publishers they work with {{and the types of}} publishing deals they are willing to accept. Talking to gaming news site Polygon, Schafer explained: [...] "We've changed our relationship with publishers. They used to be our sole source of income.

Lucy Gray, like the Lucy of the Lucy poems and Ruth of Wordsworth's [...] "Ruth" [...] are, according to H. W.

[...] Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, [...] "These <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, {{if it is true that}} I am a problem for my team then I will go. But like I said, I am happy here. The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E

[...] Protagoras was skeptical about the application of theoretical mathematics to the natural world; {{he did not believe}} they were really worth studying at all. [...] According to Philodemus, Protagoras said that [...] "The subject matter is unknowable and the terminology distasteful". [...] Nonetheless, mathematics was considered to be by some a very viable form of art, and Protagoras says on the arts, [...] "art (tekhnê) without practice and practice without art are nothing" [...] (Stobaeus, Selections 3.29.80).|$|E
2500|$|Specified at 5 to 50MiB/s, Nintendo {{cited the}} ROM cartridges' very fast load times in {{comparison}} to disc-based games.
