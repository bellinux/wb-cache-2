5000|$|The General Manager of the ELR, Richard Hacking, {{wrote to}} The Times {{newspaper}} expressing his annoyance at the L&YR's tactics. He {{claimed to have}} {{received a letter from}} the company sent on 9 March 1849 informing him of proposed changes to operational procedures resulting from a near-collision at Clifton Junction. The first change was that ELR trains would at all times give way to L&YR trains on the Manchester and Bolton line; a stop signal was to be placed 400 yd along the ELR line from the junction, to be activated whenever a L&YR train was in sight. The second change was that [...] "for the safety of the public" [...] all ELR trains would be required to stop before the points at the junction, where all passenger tickets to Manchester would be collected by L&YR employees. A daily return would be required of all passengers and other <b>freight</b> <b>booked</b> from Salford [...] "for the purpose of keeping regularly and balancing punctually the accounts of the two companies". [...] Hacking claimed to have replied stating that the near-collision had occurred because the L&YR's engine driver had ignored a signal at Clifton Junction, and that the ELR would not accept the changes requested by the L&YR. The ELR refused to supply tickets at any point, although they considered it reasonable to supply more information on their traffic using the L&YR line.|$|R

Fiona Dunscombe's The Triple Point of Water (2007) drew on her experiences of working in Soho during the 1980s. Chris Longmuir's Dead Wood (2009) was a grizzly crime novel set {{in a world of}} violence and gangland retribution. Alan Wright's Act of Murder (2010) was a tale of magic, poisonings and thespians, with some gruesome murders thrown in for good measure. Simon Ashe-Browne's Nothing Human Left (2011) was a psychological thriller set in a Dublin public school as a schoolboy's criminal desires reach a frightening conclusion. Jacob Appel's The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up was a satire of Post-9/11 patriotism in the United States. In 2014 Amy Mason won for her novel The Other Ida.

40|$|Focusing on technical, {{policy and}} social/societal {{practices}} and innovations for electrified transport for personal, public and <b>freight</b> purposes, this <b>book</b> provides a state-of-the-art overview of developments in e-mobility in Europe and the West Coast of the USA. It {{serves as a}} learning base for further implementing and commercially developing this field {{for the benefit of}} society, the environment and public health, as well as for economic development and private industry. A fast-growing, interdisciplinary sector, electric mobility links engineering, infrastructure, environment, transport and sustainable development. But despite the relevance of the topic, few publications have ever attempted to document or promote the wide range of electric mobility initiatives and projects taking place today. Addressing this need, this publication consists of case studies, reports on technological developments and examples of successful infrastructure installation in cities, which document current initiatives and serve as an inspiration for others...|$|R
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. <b>Freight</b> forwarding firms <b>book</b> cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|R

I never understood before the wonderful organization of the railroads. But they tell me that there is a bad congestion of freight down South this month. If my vegetables get tangled up in that there is no telling when they will arrive.|$|R
