Human patients are routinely scanned using an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> during imaging. However, we found that in sheep the ECG is not a reliable method for gating. We developed a software based method that allowed us to use the left ventricular pressure (LVP) as a reliable <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> By taking the time derivative of the LVP (dP/dt), {{we were able to}} start imaging at both end-diastole for systolic phase images, and end-systole for diastolic phase images. We also used MR tissue tagging to calculate 3 D strain information during diastole. Using the LVP in combination with our digital circuit provided a reliable and time efficient method for ovine cardiac imaging. Unlike the ECG signal the left ventricular pressure was a clean signal and allowed for accurate, nondelay based triggering during systole and diastole. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E

This work {{presents}} {{a method to}} obtain automatically the cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> in a PET study of rats, by employing the variation with time of the counts in the cardiac region, that can be extracted from list-mode data. In an initial step, the cardiac region is identified in the image space by backward-projecting {{a small fraction of}} the acquired data and studying the variation with time of the counts in each voxel inside said region, with frequencies within 2 and 8 Hz. The region obtained corresponds accurately to the left-ventricle of the heart of the rat. In a second step, the lines-of-response (LORs) connected with this region are found by forward-projecting this region. The time variation of the number of counts in these LORs contains the cardiac motion information that we want to extract. This variation of counts with time is band-pass filtered to reduce noise, and the time signal so obtained is used to create the <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> The result was compared with a cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> obtained from an ECG acquired simultaneously to the PET study. Reconstructed gated images obtained from both gating information are similar. The method proposed demonstrates that valid cardiac gating signals can be obtained for rats from PET list-mode data.

It requires appropriate signal processing and correct QRS detection, but gating software methods are cur-rently limited. In this study we sought to demonstrate the fea-sibility of digital real-time automatically updated gating meth-ods, based on optimizing a signal-processing technique for different mouse strains. High-resolution MR images of mouse hearts and aortic arches were acquired using a chain consisting of ECG signal detection, digital signal processing, and <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> generation modeled using Simulink (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).

40|$|Multiphase Machines offer a {{promising}} solution to many practical challenges {{due to their}} advantages over the three phase counterparts, as fault-tolerant capability and lower torque ripple magnitude. Among different multiphase machines, five-phase machines correspond to a relatively practical selection in industrial applications. Multiphase machines are conventionally fed from voltage source inverter (VSI) as it facilities the operation under open-phase condition but with a sophisticated controller. Among different power converter topologies, current source inverter (CSI) features a simple inverter structure, a lower switching dv/dt, and a reliable short circuit protection. However, the control of multiphase CSI under open phase has not been yet considered in the literature. Additionally, the space vector PWM (SVPWM) of multiphase CSI is still challenging. Alternatively, the mapped sinusoidal PWM can offer simpler control over SVPWM. In this paper, a fault-tolerant controller for a five-phase CSI inverter is introduced and proposed for medium voltage drive applications. The proposed <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> generator provides a controllable linear modulation index with the availability of over modulation.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography {{allows for}} dynamic, three-dimensional (3 D+T) imaging {{of the heart}} within animal embryos. However, direct 3 D+T imaging frame rates remain insufficient for cardiodynamic analysis. Previously, this limitation has been addressed by reconstructing 3 D+T representations of the beating heart based on sets of two-dimensional image sequences (2 D+T) acquired sequentially at high frame rate and in fixed (and parallel) planes throughout the heart. These methods either require additional hardware to trigger the acquisition of each 2 D+T series to the same phase of the cardiac cycle or accumulate registration errors as the slices are synchronized retrospectively by pairs, without a <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> Here, we present a sequential turning acquisition and reconstruction (STAR) method for 3 D+T imaging of periodically moving structures, which does not require any additional <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> and is not prone to registration error accumulation. Similarly to other sequential cardiac imaging methods, multiple fast image series are consecutively acquired for different sections but in between acquisitions, the imaging plane is rotated around the center line instead of shifted along the direction perpendicular to the slices. As the central lines of all image-sequences coincide and represent measurements of the same spatial position, {{they can be used}} to accurately synchronize all the slices to a single inherent reference signal. We characterized the accuracy of our method on a simulated dynamic phantom and successfully imaged a beating embryonic rat heart. Potentially, this method can be applied for structural or Doppler imaging approaches with any direct space imaging modality such as computed tomography, ultrasound, or light microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Fetal {{cardiovascular}} MRI {{has been}} {{hampered by the}} lack of a reliable cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> A recently proposed solution to this problem is metric optimized gating (MOG) [1 - 3]. Here, we demonstrate the ability of MOG to acquire images of the fetal myocardium without conventional cardiac gating. Our work is motivated by the need for high-resolution dynamic imaging in the assessment of fetal congenital heart disease [4]. Methods Fetal scans were performed using a 1. 5 T Avanto MRI system (Siemens, Germany). Scan lengths were kept as short as possible to avoid artifact from fetal movement (~ 5 - 10 seconds/slice). Data were acquired using a conventional cine pulse sequence triggered by a synthetic cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> The period of this trigger was constant, and chosen to be longer than the expected duration of the fetal cardiac cycle. This ensured that each line of k-space was acquired for every cardiac phase. Data were then retrospectively sorted and reconstructed using hypothetical cardiac triggers. The positions of these triggers were iteratively adjusted according to the MOG method until a metric for image quality (entropy) was optimized [1, 2, 5]. Results Figures 1 and 2 show short-axis and four-chamber views of the fetal heart, respectively. In Figure 1, the ventricles are shown at end-systole and end-diastole. Normal myocardial contraction is visible when comparing the two images and assessment of cardiac function is possible (LV ejection fraction= 60 %).

To achieve the expected control objectives, suitable control strategies must be implemented based on the available devices, system models, and control techniques. The self-commutated ac/dc converters control the electrical power by generating controllable ac fundamental and dc average outputs. These controllable outputs are controlled by the conducting state combinations of the converter switching devices, driven by their <b>gate</b> <b>signals.</b> The <b>gate</b> <b>signals</b> are specified by fundamental parameters of frequency, amplitude, and phase angle.

30|$|The {{implementation}} of the gating+ algorithm involves assessment of signal at every voxel in every frequency, selectively including the fluctuating signal due to respiratory motion only when {{and where it is}} not confounded by noise. To characterize the difference between useful signal and noise in a per-voxel per-frequency basis, we used an estimated threshold of 1.2 × effective noise. The effective noise is derived from the randomly gated image. The constant 1.2 was derived from Monte Carlo simulations: 108 combinations of ranging magnitude and phase scenarios for motion and noise vectors were simulated. Both motion and noise vectors contain an element of noise which comes with random phase. We modeled this random process and found that when the ratio between motion and noise vector magnitudes is greater than approximately 1.2, then it becomes more probable (P > 0.5) that the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> is closer to the true signal than the ungated signal. In essence, the unknown phase of the noise is managed through knowledge of its magnitude, random phase, and statistical behavior, which allows us to make a binary determination as to its likely benefit on the accuracy of the <b>gated</b> <b>signal.</b> The concept may be understood as such: intuitively, where the true motion signal vectors are much greater in magnitude than the noise vectors, the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> is more reliable regardless of the noise and should be used. When the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, then useful fluctuations will be indiscernible through the noise, thus the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> provides no added value and should not be used. The implication of this strategy is that a gating+ voxel value will, on average, have improved accuracy relative to its ungated value.|$|R
