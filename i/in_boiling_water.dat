5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|Utensils {{used for}} non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even {{otherwise}} kosher food prepared with them non-kosher.

Food prepared in a manner that violates the Shabbat (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.|$|E

50|$|The {{shelf life}} of instant noodles ranges from 4-12 months, {{depending}} on environmental factors.

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived.

Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} silk {{production}} {{is known as}} sericulture. The entire production process of silk {{can be divided into}} several steps which are typically handled by different entities.

25|$|Commercial silks {{originate}} from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred {{to produce a}} white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The pupae are killed by either dipping them <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> before the adult moths emerge or by piercing them with a needle. These factors all contribute {{to the ability of}} the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread, permitting a much stronger cloth to be woven from the silk.|$|E

25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.|$|E
25|$|Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, {{eviscerated}} {{and rinsed}} thoroughly with water. Air is pumped {{under the skin}} through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.

While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.

Later, many needles were heated <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E
