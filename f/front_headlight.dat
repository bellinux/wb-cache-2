2500|$|The Crusader “Cruiser” {{model was}} the {{high-end}} (more expensive) men/boy’s bicycle, and included additional features, such as <b>front</b> <b>headlight,</b> rear rack, and most importantly, the motobike tank. [...] The low-end model, (also described in ads' fine print as a cruiser), was the crusader “chaser,” and the ladies’ the crusader “clipper” and ‘cutter” models {{to complete the}} nautical theme in the product naming scheme. [...] Art work of U.S. Navy Cruiser ships were depicted in the Mead Cycle Co. ads.|$|E
2500|$|The touring family, {{also known}} as [...] "dressers" [...] or [...] "baggers", {{includes}} Road King, Road Glide, Street Glide and Electra Glide models offered in various trims. The Road Kings have a [...] "retro cruiser" [...] appearance and are equipped with a large clear windshield. Road Kings are reminiscent of big-twin models from the 1940s and 1950s. Electra Glides can be identified by their full front fairings. Most Electra Glides sport a fork-mounted fairing {{referred to as the}} [...] "Batwing" [...] due to its unmistakable shape. The Road Glide and Road Glide Ultra Classic have a frame-mounted fairing, referred to as the [...] "Sharknose". The Sharknose includes a unique, dual <b>front</b> <b>headlight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Finally, the Naked 125S {{version is}} almost {{identical}} to the 125R, albeit with significantly less aero parts and a single <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> assembly. Seat height: 800 mm. Wheelbase: 1349.6 mm.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A campervan conversion. This variant has flush <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b> Many {{commercial}} (van) {{versions of}} the Maestro, which shared this campervan's basic bodyshell, had smaller, recessed headlights.|$|R
5000|$|GT-A - Same option with GSR with 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission, gauge pack, deluxe velour interior, {{full leather}} or the Recaro sports seats, GT-A-only diamond cut finish 17 in alloy wheels, clear {{rear light lenses}} and all-in-one style <b>front</b> <b>headlights,</b> and short spoiler option.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the {{medium-duty}} Ford F-Series (F-600 through F-800 and all Ford B-Series) {{were given}} their first update since 1980. All versions (except severe-service) received a hood redesign which enlarged the grille {{and moved the}} turn signal indicators {{to the outside of}} the <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scrambler - Similar to the Roadster, the Scrambler {{featured}} a <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> and rear tail/brake lights, however {{it came with}} a 3.5 HP Tecumseh engine and single speed jackshaft. Same colors offered as the Roadster and Goat/Ram.|$|E
50|$|Until 2000, {{the factory}} code was K589. For model year 2001 the K1200RS was revised {{with a new}} model code, K547. That year the <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> panel was modified, foot peg {{position}} was lowered and handlebars raised slightly. Previously optional ABS was made standard in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|... 303 [...] "Collegiate": Street- and trail-based {{college campus}} bike. This model had rear {{taillights}} as a stock option and optional <b>front</b> <b>headlight.</b> It used a [...] Briggs and Stratton engine and Bonham now produced their own [...] "Climb-Away" [...] clutch and transmission, with {{a broader range}} of ratios.|$|E
5000|$|Regulations for the GT1 {{category}} {{stipulated that}} to be eligible, a total of 25 cars must be built for road use. Porsche developed two fully road-legal versions, dubbed [...] "911 GT1 Straßenversion", and delivered one in early 1996 to the German government for compliance testing, which it passed. The engine had to be slightly de-tuned to meet European emissions laws, although its 600 Nm rpm at 4250 and [...] at 7200 rpm {{proved to be more}} than adequate; the vehicle could accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) from a standstill in 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 308 km/h. [...] The second vehicle {{is in the hands of}} Bahrain-based private collector Khalid M. Abdul Rahim These two vehicles feature 993 style <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b> A further 20 units were built in 1997 with 996 style <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As the Falcon {{became the}} Mustang and the Maverick became the Granada, Ford restyled the Escort from the {{beltline}} {{up and turned}} the rear seats into cargo space. The distinguishing feature between the vehicles would be an all-new rear hatchback and <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b> Mercury received a similar variant of the Lynx named the LN7.|$|R
50|$|This {{facelift}} includes new <b>front</b> <b>headlights,</b> redesigned <b>front</b> {{and rear}} bumpers, new exterior mirrors, new rim choices, a larger front grille, restyled interior, {{and a new}} ML 420 CDI engine choice. The ML 280 CDI became the ML 300 CDI, the 320 CDI became the 350 CDI, and the 420 CDI became the 450 CDI.|$|R
50|$|Transmission was via a torque {{converter}} and a jackshaft final drive mounted {{ahead of the}} leading coupled wheels. In addition, there was a two-speed gearbox with ratios of 5.76:1 and 19.52:1 giving top speeds of 50 mi/h km/h and 15 mi/h km/h respectively in both forward and reverse. As delivered, it had its maker's trade name Harlandic on a plate just below the <b>front</b> <b>headlight.</b>|$|E

50|$|For 2008, Mazda {{released}} a Special Edition MX-5 in Icy Blue exterior, with exclusive Dark Saddle Brown folding top, with matching leather with blue stitching steering wheel, seats, and hand brake. The Special Edition also featured a silver-accented shift knob, dark-silver finished instrument panel with chrome accents, special 17 in alloy wheels, stainless steel MX-5 scuff plate, and chrome <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> bezel, {{as well as}} grille and fog lamp surrounds. The 2008 Special Edition was limited to 105 PRHT-equipped units in Canada and 750 soft-top units in the US.|$|E
50|$|Volkswagen made {{a choice}} of three and five-door {{hatchback}} or a five-door station wagon available. The European Golf wagon was nearly identical to the North American Jetta Wagon. The only difference {{was the use of}} the Golf <b>front</b> <b>headlights,</b> bumpers, grille, hood, and fenders as these parts are interchangeable between the Mk4 Golf and Bora/Jetta.|$|R
50|$|Various {{cosmetic}} changes {{include a}} revised grille, redesigned <b>front</b> <b>headlights,</b> bumpers, side air-intake grills, rear boot, etc. It held a decent amount of sales despite problems including uneven shut {{lines on the}} drivers door on models for the United Kingdom. Production was suspended in April 2005, when MG Rover collapsed. 39,249 MG TFs were built from 2002 until 2005.|$|R
50|$|Škoda on 10 January 2017 in Vienna {{presented}} {{the third generation}} Octavia with facelift, the main changes brought mainly split <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> and a new system for predictive pedestrian protection. The first cars were delivered to customers before spring. The new Skoda Octavia  has finally launched at an introductory price of Rs 15.49 lakh (Ex showroom, Pan India)>.|$|R
50|$|When an {{inspector}} {{is put in}} charge of watching Spratt and the others, Humpty's car, the ford zephyr, is found. They were about to remove it from the garage it was found in, but Jack realises that the <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> has removed and a wire was feeding through it. He orders everyone to run away and the car explodes. Spratt and Mary then interview a woman who was divorced from Humpty. She reveals that she killed Humpty out of jealousy by putting three poisonous tablets in his coffee. Jack then tells her that Humpty was shot, not poisoned and that she is innocent.|$|E
50|$|Styling {{changes were}} minor. Taillights were now {{recessed}} in body-color bezels that were divided {{by a single}} central horizontal bar. <b>Front</b> <b>headlight</b> bezels were now made of nylon and similarly body colored. A new injection molded ABS plastic grille was dominated by a horizontal bar that extended forward in the center from the sides, while its outline had squared off edges that wrapped forward into the inner headlight extensions. Fender-mounted marker lights were added at {{the front and rear}} as standard equipment, as the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations mandated their application (along with seat belts beginning January 1, 1968) to all passenger cars sold in the United States for 1968.|$|E

50|$|It {{incorporates}} {{the fuel tank}} into the frame and has no external bodywork or fairings. It has a stainless steel under-seat exhaust, a four-speed manual gearbox or automatic transmission and dual hydraulic disc brake. The <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> are positioned vertically. In the US, the 49 cc model is limited to 40 mph to qualify as a moped in some jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|The trim {{levels were}} once again revised in 2006. Nissan is still selling the Nissan X-Trail T30 model in some countries, where {{it is called the}} Nissan X-Trail Classic. In 2007, the Yulon {{manufactured}} model version got a facelift. In Taiwan at least, the Nissan X-Trail T30 model has slightly larger and different shaped <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> and different <b>front</b> grille.|$|R
50|$|The Electrocity {{design was}} facelifted in 2005 {{to match the}} updated Cadet design, with the main {{noticeable}} change being rounded <b>front</b> <b>headlights.</b> Following the collapse of TransBus International in 2004 and subsequent cancellation of the Enviro200H programme, Transport for London placed {{the first order of}} six Electrocities, based on VDL SB120 chassis, for use on route 360 (operated by Go-Ahead Group subsidiary London Central); this first batch of buses entered service in early 2006.|$|R
50|$|Graham McRae {{imported}} {{a replica}} McLaren M6B made by US based Manta Cars {{and called the}} Montage. McRae approached David Harrod of Fibreglass Developments Limited (FDL) of Bunnythorpe in the late 1970s to make a mould of the Montage. McRae intended to build and sell the cars in New Zealand. Harrod set about making the moulds and redesigned the doors, <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> position, lowered the seat mounts. McRae sold his interest to Harrod {{as he had been}} offered a mechanic position with US Skoal Bandit racing team of Paul Newman. McLaren were approached for consent to build the car as its design was subject to their patents. They refused, but as their patent ran out in 1981 Harrod was free to build and sell the cars. A total of 37 cars were built with 4 being sold in Australia. Harrod left for Australia in 1982 and Steve Bond took over.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{competing}} in Europe and America, Prince Leopold competed in Australia {{also with a}} drive the 1984 James Hardie 1000 driving a Group A BMW 635 CSi for Frank Gardner's factory backed JPS Team BMW, partnering [...] Formula One World Champion Denny Hulme. In Australian touring car racing Group A was only a minor class introduced for the endurance races in 1984 before taking over as top class in 1985. After a troubled week which included losing {{a day after the}} Prince crashed the BMW at the top of The Mountain due to a lost front wheel, the pair finished the race in 15th place and 2nd in class, 4 laps behind the class winning TWR Rover Vitesse and 15 laps behind the race winning Holden Dealer Team Commodore. von Bayern (and Hulme) both had a new experience while racing at Bathurst in 1984. Their BMW was equipped with a racecam unit fitted in place of the left <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> and both drivers were able to talk to the Channel 7 television commentary team while they were driving with the Prince saying at one point that [...] "The race is very much fun for me".|$|E
5000|$|An {{up close}} {{examination}} of the Chaparral 2F (Mercury [...] "articolo" [...] # 30), produced about 1970, {{is a good example}} of the company's ingenuity. The rear wing (which along with its struts was diecast metal) moved up and down and also tilted. The gull-wing doors were molded in clear plastic with lower portions painted white like the body. Rear mesh covering the engine and lined vents added realism. Sometimes Mercury models went above and beyond the norm. On the Chaparral, this was seen in minutae lilke tiny dual diecast metal gas caps which opened. Decals were fairly precise and historically accurate including sponsorship by Shell and toy model manufacturer Cox - labeled on the sides. The steering wheel was a couple of sizes too big, but other features made up for that. The <b>front</b> <b>headlight</b> were cast not in clear plastic, but in a yellowish tint. The exhaust tips exited the rear molded into a separate metal plate - the tips were also machined to look hollow. Also, Chaparral creator Jim Hall was from Texas and the Mercury version has yellow Texas plates.Having stated many positives, this model, produced about 1970, was not perfect in proportion. The rear quarters look a bit too thick and square and the gentle curve of the doors up to the engine lid vents is lost on this model. Also, those vents on the real car are molded to look like two separate intakes while it is a single intake on each side of the model. The front grill on the Mercury is just an elongated rectangle while the real car's was oval-ish.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{the actual}} race chassis were built, sharing only basic key {{structural}} elements {{with the road}} cars. A firewall was placed immediately behind the driver's seat in the cockpit, eliminating any rear visibility inside the car. A large diffuser and wing {{were added to the}} rear, while a splitter and vents on the hood were added to the <b>front.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> were also replaced with protruding permanent units in place of the pop-up headlights on the road car.|$|R
50|$|It {{replaced}} the ZIL-4104 in 1985 and {{had virtually no}} mechanical changes compared with that model. The only major changes {{have been in the}} styling, which in some respects, notably in the rear-view mirrors, was subtly modernised compared to the styling of previous ZIL models. The front turn indicators were also modernised, with the rectangular horizontal line giving way to a more vertically oriented, door-like shape. The <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> were also restyled, as was the rear parcel shelf.|$|R
5000|$|Limited Edition (badged [...] "LE" [...] {{and based}} on Executive with Verada appointments; 4-speed automatic; KJ series <b>front</b> {{parabola}} <b>headlights</b> with amber turn bezels) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 {{it became}} clear {{additional}} motive power was required in the North Island, but the process of dieselisation was yet to begin. Consequently, NZR chose to order 16 steam locomotives from North British {{to the design of}} the successful J class. These locomotives contained a number of differences to both the J class and Hillside JAs - although turned out with the cross-compound pump, roller bearings on the rods were limited to the connection between the connecting and driving rod, mechanical lubrication was employed. In January 1951 the order had been made for the 16 JA to be more coal burners, and North British regarded the order as essentially a repeat order, virtually identical to 1939 J, but in April 1951 the NZR CME requested the order to be changed to oil burning due to perceived long term coal shortage due to the waterfront strike and the associated strike by miners and unavailability of shipping for coal and the expected long term high imported coal price and the long time it would take to build up coal stocks to safe levels, and the class were built as oil burners, with no grate, ash pan or fire door (the only class of locomotives on the NZR to be built completely as oil burners)and ACFL blow down was incorporated late in their construction. A significant improvement was the incorporation of French T.I.A, blow down equipment which enabled rapid ejection of boiler sludge and reduced the boiler scale, enabling much faster turnaround and higher availability. The system of injection of the oil flow into the burners is different and far more effective than in NZR 1948-50 conversion of 12 Js to oil burning. Other detail differences was the use of Stone's headlights and electrical generator instead of the usual Pyle National equipment, the [...] "Butterfly" [...] number boards on the <b>front</b> <b>headlight,</b> and the lack of smokebox number plate (although a smokebox plate was specified by the NZR).|$|E
50|$|In 1975 {{the model}} {{underwent}} a facelift by Giorgetto Giugiaro; the circular <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> {{were replaced by}} rectangular ones and its rear was altered amid several modifications, while the SEAT 124 and SEAT 1430 ranges were unified under a single model officially named SEAT 124D versión 75. The car's initial production in Zona Franca was transferred in 1976 to the Landaben - newly acquired from Authi - plant in Pamplona, resulting in {{the elimination of the}} '124 Familiar' station wagon 5-door versions.|$|R
50|$|The Boxster was {{released}} {{ahead of its}} big brother, the 996. The 986 Boxster had the same bonnet, <b>front</b> wings, <b>headlights,</b> interior and engine architecture as the 996.|$|R
50|$|Bombardier INNOVIA APM 256 (Sometimes {{referred}} as the Taipei Metro CITYFLO650 by its control system, and internally code-named C370 by the running company of Taipei Metro, Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation) {{is the second}} generation of automated guideway transit rolling stock to be used on Taipei Metro Line 1 (Brown Line) of the Taipei Metro. They are distinguished from their predecessors, Matra VAL256, by their circular <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> and a grey livery, with a green stripe above. Also, instead of yellow forward-facing seats, the train offers blue seats that face inward.|$|R
40|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of LED technology into automotive <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> there is the de-icing of the headlight covers required. Different materials as bottom and top layers in a silver based three layer stack have been investigated with respect to the electrical and optical properties of the transparent conductive film. The transparent conductive multilayer-stacks have been deposited by means of pulsed magnetron sputtering onto rigid plastic plates and on float glass. Results are presented from the investigation of the influence of different dielectric and conductive oxide layers onto silver based transparent conductive multilayer-stacks for automotive application...|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} {{designed}} {{to compete with the}} Alexander ALX400 body, and had neat rectangular <b>front</b> <b>headlights</b> below a large front windscreen. From the side, it can be easily recognised by the different depths of windows on the lower deck; however, this is less apparent with newer bonded-glazed models. Seating varied according to the chassis and specification. TfL models were typically built with 41 seats upstairs, and 23 downstairs, with a centre exit door. Early TfL versions also had the staircase moved to the centre of the bus, although this was later changed to the standard position of just behind the driver.|$|R
