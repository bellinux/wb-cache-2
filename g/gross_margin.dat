40|$|SIGNIFICANCE: The tobacco {{industry}} argues that tobacco sales {{are important to}} small retailers’ business. We examined 1) tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales, and profits in small shops, 2) differences by area deprivation and smoking prevalence, and 3) the role of e-cigarettes. METHODS: Sales data from 1447 shops covering two 2 -week periods in 2015 (weeks starting 1 June, 8 June, 14 Sept, 21 Sept) recorded by electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) in small shops in the UK were obtained from an EPOS company. Data were aggregated into weekly tobacco, non-tobacco, and e-cigarette sales values, <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales quantities, and transactions. RESULTS: For the week starting 21 Sept (N= 1416), mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> on tobacco products were 6. 6 % (SD= 2. 2) and 24. 1 % (SD= 4. 9) on non-tobacco products. Mean total sales values (tobacco+non-tobacco sales) =£ 14, 893. 58 (SD= 8543. 91) while mean tobacco sales=£ 3, 716. 17 (SD= 2087. 16), thus tobacco accounted for 26. 0 % (SD= 0. 08) of total sales. Mean total gross profits=£ 2, 894. 54 (SD= 1788. 81) while mean gross profits from tobacco were only £ 241. 80 (SD= 165. 41), thus tobacco accounted for 9. 1 % (SD= 0. 05) of total profits. Area smoking prevalence and deprivation were both positively correlated with tobacco sales values and tobacco gross profits, but negatively correlated with tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> (p< 0. 0001 for all). N= 550 shops {{had at least one}} e-cigarette transaction, with a mean of 3. 2 (SD= 5. 3) transactions and mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> of 43. 4 % (SD= 10. 5). Week 4 (N= 1416) was chosen for presentation because it was the most current and had fewer EPOS errors. Findings across the 4 weeks were similar although small differences were found, including tobacco and total sales values (p< 0. 0001). Tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> did not differ (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high sales values, tobacco has low <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> compared to other products. Tobacco sales values are higher in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas. The lower <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> on tobacco in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas suggest that more smokers in these areas smoke cheap discount brands.

40|$|Ethanol {{production}} {{over the}} past few years has been both a haven and heartache for investors in corn-based ethanol facilities. Record-high returns in 2006 and 2007 have vanished in the face of precipitous drops in <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> in 2008. Using a real options approach, we analyze investment and operating decisions of corn-based dry-grind ethanol facilities and identify trigger prices that signal the optimal times in which to change the status of plant operations. Specifically, we identify the levels of <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> (price of ethanol less price of corn) that trigger firm investment and entry, suspension and reactivation of existing plants, and, finally, exit of plants from the industry. Margin triggers were estimated for three classes of plants, differentiated by plant size. Entry margin triggers drop from $ 1. 78 to $ 1. 33 per gallon as plants size increases, given economies of size in production. Exit margin triggers are more similar across plant sizes, ranging from $ 0. 17 to $ 0. 13 per gallon. In addition, firms will mothball plants when <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> drop to around $ 0. 17 per gallon, and later reactivate if margins increase to between $ 0. 66 and $ 0. 79, depending on plant size.
