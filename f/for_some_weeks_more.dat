25|$|The clutch size {{generally}} is 3–5 eggs {{with an average}} of four. For 22–26 days both sexes take turns incubating the eggs. The young are so precocial that they are seen swimming within two hours after hatching and are also capable of rapid land velocity at that early time. In spite of this early development the young normally return to the nest for resting for one or two more days. They fledge after about one month but remain dependent on their parents <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> Birds begin to breed at 1–2 years of age.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{days after}} Mr. Brumley's visit Susan Burnet reached Black Strand. She too had been baffled for a while. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>week</b> or <b>more</b> she couldn't {{discover}} {{the whereabouts of}} Lady Harman and lived in the profoundest perplexity. She had brought back her curtains to the Putney house in a large but luggable bundle, they were all made and ready to put up, and she found the place closed and locked, in the charge of a caretaker whose primary duty it was to answer no questions. It needed several days of thought and amazement, and {{a vast amount of}} [...] "I wonder," [...] and [...] "I just would like to know," [...] before it occurred to Susan that if she wrote to Lady Harman at the Putney address the letter might be forwarded. And even then she almost wrecked the entire enterprise by mentioning the money, and it was by a quite exceptional inspiration that she thought after all it was wiser not to say that but to state that she had finished the curtains and done everything (underlined) that Lady Harman had desired. Sir Isaac read it and tossed it over to his wife. [...] "Make her send her bill," [...] he remarked.|$|R
6000|$|Some hours after, {{he came to}} me in my library, {{asked if}} I forgave him, and desired to be reconciled. I drew the lad to my side, and there I kept him a good while, and had much talk with him, in the course of which he {{disclosed}} many points of feeling and thought I approved of in my son. I found, it is true, few elements of the [...] "good fellow" [...] or the [...] "fine fellow" [...] in him; scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash over the wine cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of compassion, affection, fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of wholesome principles--reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile bearing. So I bestowed on his large forehead, and on his cheek--still pale with tears--a proud and contented kiss, and sent him away comforted. Yet I saw him the next day laid on the mound under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered with his hands; he was melancholy <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>weeks,</b> and <b>more</b> than a year elapsed before he would listen to any proposal of having another dog.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1985 Dixon began {{supporting}} the idea of leaving the party and setting up a think tank in Washington, D.C. Many in the party at this point became increasingly irate at Dixon's behavior, citing her alcoholism and paranoia making her increasingly erratic and too unstable to speak to. She encouraged her lieutenants to launch a [...] "Quality of Life" [...] campaign within the party so that party members could assess their own lives. Lieutenants took this at face value and in late October members of the party began {{talking to each other}} on various party issues and their own lives regardless of party rules and regulations, this being made possible by Dixon's absence from the country while on a trip to Eastern Europe. The party's lieutenants called together various members and began speaking out against aspects of the party while discussing its [...] "real nature." [...] Party sessions continued <b>for</b> <b>some</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> until the night before Dixon was scheduled to return. On that night party members convened and unanimously voted to expel the General Secretary (Dixon) from the party, and then to dissolve it. A vote by mail was held in April 1986 amid heated discussions {{on the future of the}} party and a majority voted to confirm the party's dissolution and to liquidate its assets, to be shared among former cadres (which was achieved in August 1987).|$|R
60|$|It was {{not till}} after I had {{withdrawn}} {{to my own}} chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in {{the substance of the}} narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him {{when he was in the}} act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>weeks</b> been <b>more</b> uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.|$|R
40|$|ON May 27, 1940, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} its opinion in Apex Hosiery Co. v. William Leader.
