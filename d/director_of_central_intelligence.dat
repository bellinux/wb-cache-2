5|$|On 7 October 1950, Truman {{selected}} Smith as <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (DCI), {{the head}} of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Since the post had been established in 1946, there had been three directors, none of whom had wanted the job.|$|E
5|$|President of the United States Gerald Ford {{approved}} covert aid to UNITA and the FNLA through Operation IA Feature on 18 July 1975, despite {{strong opposition}} from {{officials in the}} State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Ford told William Colby, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> to establish the operation, providing an initial US$6million. He granted an additional $8million on 27 July and another $25million in August.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence),</b> and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{he served}} as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. Then in 1950, Smith became the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The United Fruit Company {{was badly}} {{affected}} by the reforms of Jacobo Árbenz, especially Decree 900, the agrarian reform law. It responded with an intensive lobbying campaign directed at members of the United States government. The Cold War had also predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. The CIA started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> ordered J. C. King, {{the chief of the}} Western Hemisphere Division, to examine whether dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from the authoritarian governments in Central America.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{is remembered}} in the CIA {{as its first}} {{successful}} <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> {{and one of its}} most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.|$|E

Johnson immediately chose Helms to serve as Deputy <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (DDCI). Raborn and Helms soon journeyed to the LBJ ranch in Texas.
