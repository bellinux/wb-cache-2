25|$|The {{most common}} {{role of women}} in active service was that of a {{searchlight}} operator. In fact, all {{of the members of the}} 93rd Searchlights Regiment were females (Harris). Despite being limited in their roles, there was a great amount of respect between the men and women in the mixed batteries. In fact, one report states, “Many men were amazed that women could make adequate gunners despite their excitable temperament, lack of technical instincts, their lack of interest in aeroplanes and their physical weaknesses”. While women still faced discrimination from some of the highly stereotypical older soldiers and officers who did not like women “playing with their guns”, women were still given rifle practice and taught to use anti-aircraft guns while serving in their batteries. They were told that this was in case the Germans invaded…however <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately.).|$|E
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E

2500|$|Compared to the {{six-speed}} DCT {{currently used}} in the European-market Cee'd models, the new transmission is expected to deliver a fuel-economy improvement of 7% and a 5% improvement in 0–62mph acceleration times.

For Bellini, it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her, and he had no interest in doing that, having cooled in his feelings for her.

60|$|But this arrangement, {{which would}} have been {{pleasant}} enough before,--which seemed to be very pleasant when John Ball was last in Mr Slow's chambers, telling that gentleman {{that he was going to}} make everything smooth by marrying his cousin,--was not by any means so pleasant now. He had felt, when he was mentioning the proposed arrangement to Margaret, that the very naming of it seemed to imply that Mr Maguire and his visit were to go for nothing.

60|$|As he jogged along {{she took}} in some degree the measure of what that might mean, Julia's seeking a little to avoid them. Was she growing to dislike them? Did she think they kept too sharp an eye on her, so {{that the idea of}} their {{standing}} in a still closer relation wouldn't be enticing? Her conduct up to this time had not worn such an appearance, unless perhaps a little, just a very little, in the matter of her ways with poor Grace. Lady Agnes knew she wasn't particularly fond of poor Grace, and could even sufficiently guess the reason--the manner in which Grace betrayed most how they wanted to make sure of her. She remembered how long the girl had stayed the last time she had been at Harsh--going for an acceptable week and dragging out her visit to a month. She took a private heroic vow that Grace shouldn't go near the place again for a year; not, that is, unless Nick and Julia were married within the time. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> happen she shouldn't care. She recognised that it wasn't absolutely everything Julia should be in love with Nick; it was also better she should dislike his mother and sisters after a probable pursuit of him than before. Lady Agnes did justice to the natural rule in virtue of which it usually comes to pass that a woman doesn't get on with her husband's female belongings, and was even willing to be sacrificed to it in her disciplined degree. But she desired not to be sacrificed for nothing: if she was to be objected to as a mother-in-law she wished to be the mother-in-law first.|$|E
6000|$|Little {{by little}} indeed, under the {{vividness}} of Kate's behaviour, the probabilities {{fell back into}} their order. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate couldn't help it--could only be sorry and kind: wouldn't that, without wild flurries, cover everything? Milly at all events tried it as a cover, tried it hard, for the time; pulled it over her, in the front, the larger room, drew it up to her chin with energy. If it didn't, so treated, do everything for her, it did {{so much that she}} could herself supply the rest. She made that up by the interest of her great question, the question of whether, seeing him once more, with all that, as she called it to herself, had come and gone, her impression of him would be different from the impression received in New York. That had held her from the moment of their leaving the museum; it kept her company through their drive and during luncheon; and now that she was {{a quarter of an hour}} alone with him it became acute. She was to feel at this crisis that no clear, no common answer, no direct satisfaction on this point, was to reach her; she was to see her question itself simply go to pieces. She couldn't tell if he were different or not, and she didn't know nor care if she were: these things had ceased to matter in the light of the only thing she did know. This was that she liked him, as she put it to herself, as much as ever; and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> amount to liking a new person the amusement would be but the greater. She had thought him at first very quiet, in spite of recovery from his original confusion; though even the shade of bewilderment, she yet perceived, had not been due to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified identity as the probable sight, over there, of many thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified. No, he was quiet, inevitably, for the first half of the time, because Milly's own lively line--the line of spontaneity--made everything else relative; and because too, so far as Kate was spontaneous, it was ever so finely in the air among them that the normal pitch must be kept. Afterwards, when they had got a little more used, as it were, to each other's separate felicity, he had begun to talk more, clearly bethought himself, at a given moment, of what his natural lively line would be. It would be to take for granted she must wish to hear of the States, and to give her, in its order, everything he had seen and done there. He abounded, of a sudden he almost insisted; he returned, after breaks, to the charge; and the effect was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever to what he had admired, as he went, or to what he hadn't. He simply drenched her with his sociable story--especially during the time they were away from the others. She had stopped then being American--all to let him be English; a permission of which he took, she could feel, both immense and unconscious advantage. She had really never cared less for the [...] "States" [...] than at this moment; but that had nothing to do with the matter. It would have been the occasion of her life to learn about them, for nothing could put him off, and he ventured on no reference to what had happened for herself. It might have been almost as if he had known that the greatest of all these adventures was her doing just what she did then.|$|E
