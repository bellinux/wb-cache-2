25|$|She {{became a}} fan of hip hop music {{at the age of}} 14 and {{improved}} her English by listening and rapping along to famous American rappers such as Eminem. At the age of 15, she started hanging out with lots of bad guys, which made her parents worry about her and therefore always keep an eye on her. The reason she chose music to be her career is that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> safe. She was also interested in skateboarding, and accepted the invitation to join a nu-metal band covering Linkin Park’s songs. She then quickly became a well-recognized and respected rapper from the Vietnamese underground scene.|$|E

While at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, she met Francis J. Underwood, a Harvard Law student from South Carolina. She is from a wealthy family, and the show characterizes her as a [...] "Dallas Debutante" [...] and [...] "Lily White". [...] She recounts her father's taking her to Dealey Plaza, where John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> “so sad, so angry". She has a difficult relationship with her mother, Elizabeth Hale (Ellen Burstyn), who despises Frank and is disappointed in Claire for marrying him.|$|E
500|$|Karen Gillan {{had to wear}} a latex {{prosthetic}} stomach bump for {{the scenes}} which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] and {{pulled back in a}} ponytail. The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E

500|$|New {{fragrance}} project working {{sessions for}} Heat Rush took place backstage in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in November 2009 and the fragrance {{was released in}} February 2011. During the new fragrance project working sessions, Beyoncé deciphered through different scents, later choosing a [...] "Sunset Cocktail Mod 5" [...] scent because <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "as though a breeze were coming through the room" [...] and seemed [...] "like more of a risk". Beyoncé's official perfume website described Heat Rush as a fruity, floral fragrance [...] "that is luminous and vibrant with a dewy delicacy at the same time... It captures Beyoncé's bright sensuality; it's young, fresh, and joyful." [...] The same source listed the scent's top notes as passion fruit, orange and cherry; the middle notes meant to embody [...] "Beyoncé's ultra-feminine side" [...] with orchid, mango and orange hibiscus; and the base notes contain teak, honey and a musk blend that {{was said to be}} inspired by sunsets in Brazil.|$|E
500|$|The entire storyline that {{centered}} around Quinn, Puck and Shelby was roundly criticized by reviewers. West wrote that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "queasy", {{and she called}} Quinn's actions [...] "abhorrent". Bell {{was one of several}} who thought it was highly implausible that Child Protective Services would be backed up, much less for two weeks, given the gravity of Quinn's accusations. Hankinson wondered why they [...] "made Quinn a total sociopath" [...] who went from [...] "dancing on desks" [...] to [...] "framing someone for child endangerment" [...] with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment [...] "a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the [...] "storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting". He also noted that it was [...] "cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out the earnest craziness of Quinn". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're actually going to go there?" [...] vein by Canning and [...] "as realistic as Lord Tubbington pooping candy bars" [...] by Michael Slezak of TVLine.|$|E

It shows me what I've thought all along: that Ellen hasn't really cared anything for that miserable thing since he first began going with Mrs. Uphill a year ago. When he wrote that letter to her in New York {{she wanted to be}} sure she didn't, and when he offered himself and misbehaved so to both of you, she was afraid that she and you were somehow to blame. Now she's worked it out that no one else was wronged, and she is satisfied. <b>It's</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> free, as she says. But, oh, dear me!" [...] Mrs. Kenton broke off, [...] "I talk as if there was nothing to bind her; and yet there is what poor Richard did! What would she say if she knew that? I have been cautioning Lottie and Boyne, but I know it will come out somehow. Do you think it's wise to keep it from her? Hadn't we better tell her? Or shall we wait and see--" ...|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. Halliday {{went out}} Evelyn tried to {{formulate}} her thoughts. To begin with, her mother's calculating caution repelled her; <b>it</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> shabby. Then she had, no doubt, taken much for granted. Jim had, perhaps, had bad luck, {{but this did}} not mean that he was impoverished, and after all there were many expensive things one could go without. She was not as greedy as some people thought. Indeed, it would be rather fine to make a plunge; to let cold caution go and play a romantic part.|$|R
6000|$|So {{she tried}} to reason him out of it, or to amuse him, but without effect. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> beside herself. Then the father, always impatient, would jump {{from his chair and}} shout: ...|$|E

60|$|Miriam {{took off}} her things and looked round. It was a bare, severe room. Her photo, Clara's, Annie's, were on the wall. She looked on the drawing-board {{to see what he}} was doing. There were only a few {{meaningless}} lines. She looked to see what books he was reading. Evidently just an ordinary novel. The letters in the rack she saw were from Annie, Arthur, and from some man or other she did not know. Everything he had touched, everything that was in the least personal to him, she examined with lingering absorption. He had been gone from her for so long, she wanted to rediscover him, his position, what he was now. But there was not much in the room to help <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> only <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> rather sad, <b>it</b> was so hard and comfortless.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat there}} for a long while in silence; the beer had got to Liza's head, and the warm night air filled her with a double intoxication. She felt the arm round her waist, and the big, heavy form {{pressing}} against her side; she experienced again the curious sensation as if her heart were about to burst, and it choked her--a feeling so oppressive and painful <b>it</b> almost <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> sick. <b>Her</b> hands began to tremble, and her breathing grew rapid, as though she were suffocating. Almost fainting, she swayed over towards the man, and a cold shiver ran through her from top to toe. Jim bent over her, and, taking her in both arms, he pressed his lips to hers in a long, passionate kiss. At last, panting for breath, she turned her head away and groaned.|$|R
5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said <b>it</b> only <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> more lonely and isolated.|$|R
60|$|His wife {{watched him}} as {{he put on his}} {{overcoat}} and hat. He was well-dressed, handsome-looking. She felt there was a curious glamour about him. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> bitter. He had an unfair advantage--he was free to go off, while she must stay at home with the children.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} have a power of {{reaching}} rather intimate conversation in one silent and cat-like bound, as he had scaled the steep road, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> him to be dangerous, and perhaps unscrupulous. She changed the subject sharply, not without it movement toward gratifying her own curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Such {{a speech}} from ninety-nine {{people out of}} a hundred would have annoyed Anne bitterly; but {{the way in which}} Mr. Douglas said <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> that she had {{received}} a very real and pleasing compliment.

6000|$|Amabel {{was much}} impressed, {{as she thought}} {{what it would have}} been for him if his little wife bad been {{snatched}} from him so suddenly and frightfully. His return--his meeting her mother--his desolate home and solitary life. She could almost have wept for him. Yet, at the moment of relief from the fear of such misery, he could thus speak. He could look onward to the joy beyond, even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension; and how great they had been was shown by the broken words he uttered in his sleep, for several nights afterwards, while by day he was always watching and cautioning her. Assuredly his dependence on the joy that could not be lost did not make her doubt his tenderness; <b>it</b> only <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> how far behind him she was, for would it have been the same with her, had the danger been his? ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} would think, or try to think, of Herbert, and of all his virtues and of all his goodness. He too loved her well. She never doubted that. He {{had come to her}} with soft words, and {{pleasant}} smiles, and sweet honeyed compliments--compliments which had been sweet to her as they are to all girls; but his soft words, and pleasant smiles, and honeyed love-making had never given her so strong a thrill of strange delight as had those few words from Owen. Her very heart's core had been affected by the vigour of his affection. There had been in it a mysterious grandeur which had half charmed and half frightened <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> that he, were it fated that she should belong to him, would indeed be her lord and ruler; that his was a spirit before which hers would bend and feel itself subdued. With him she could realize all that she had dreamed of woman's love; and that dream which is so sweet to some women--of woman's subjugation. But could it be the same with him to whom she was now positively affianced, with him to whom she knew that she did now owe all her duty? She feared that it was not the same.|$|R
6000|$|Kitty innocently {{singled out}} the worst picture in the place as her favorite, and then was piqued, and {{presently}} frightened, at his cold reluctance about <b>it.</b> He <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> was very bad, and that she shared its inferiority, though he said nothing to that effect. She learned the shame of not being a connoisseur in a connoisseur's company, and she perceived more painfully than ever before that a Bostonian, who had been much in Europe, might be very uncomfortable to the simple, unravelled American. Yet, she reminded herself, the Marches had been in Europe, and they were Bostonians also; {{and they did not}} go about putting everything under foot; they seemed to care for everything they saw, and to have a friendly jest, if not praises, for it. She liked that; she would have been well enough pleased to have Mr. Arbuton laugh outright at her picture, and she could have joined him in it. But the look, however flattered into an air of polite question at last, which he had bent upon her, seemed to outlaw her and condemn her taste in everything. As they passed out of the cathedral, she would rather have gone home than continued the walk as he begged her, if she were not tired, to do; but this would have been flight, and she was not a coward. So they sauntered down the Rue Fabrique, and turned into Palace Street. As they went by the door of Hôtel Musty, her pleasant friends came again into her mind, and she said, [...] "This is where we stayed last week, with Mr. and Mrs. March." ...|$|R
60|$|She went on, but he {{remained}} standing stock {{still in the}} dusk. She had already reached the three palms when she heard behind her a loud peal of laughter, cynical and joyless, such as is heard in smoking-rooms {{at the end of}} a scandalous story. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> positively faint for a moment.|$|E
60|$|She stood {{letting him}} adore her and tremble with joy of her. It healed her hurt pride. It healed her; {{it made her}} glad. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> erect and proud again. Her pride had been wounded inside her. She had been cheapened. Now she {{radiated}} with joy and pride again. It was her restoration and her recognition.|$|E
60|$|There was {{one thing}} she {{determined}} to do immediately, and that was, to begin a series of hospitalities,--and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> proud {{to think that she}} could do this and do it handsomely, and yet do it in the old home where everybody knew she had for years been obliged to practise the strictest economy.|$|E
6000|$|JONES. I suppose I may {{go where}} I like. Where may I go? The other day I {{went to a}} place in the Edgware Road.

6000|$|But why, {{when the}} boys wanted to be begged off, was the schoolmistress to be their advocate? Because Grace Harvey exercised, without {{intending}} anything of the kind, an almost mesmeric influence on every one in the little town. Goodness rather than talent had given her wisdom, and goodness rather than courage a power of using that wisdom, which, to those simple, superstitious folk, seemed altogether an inspiration. There was a mystery about her, too, which worked strongly on {{the hearts of the}} West-country people. She was supposed to be at times [...] "not right;" [...] and wandering intellect is with them, as with many primitive peoples, an object more of awe than of pity. Her deep melancholy alternated with bursts of wild eloquence, with fantastic fables, with entreaties and warnings against sin, full of such pity and pathos that they melted, at times, the hardest hearts. A whole world of strange tales, half false, half true, had grown up around her as she grew. She was believed to spend whole nights in prayer; to speak with visitors from the other world; even to have the power of seeing into futurity. The intensity of her imagination gave rise to the belief that she had only to will, and she could see whom she would, and all that they were doing, even across the seas; her exquisite sensibility, <b>it</b> was whispered, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> every bodily suffering she witnessed, as acutely as the sufferer's self, and in the very limb in which he suffered. Her deep melancholy was believed to be caused by some dark fate--by some agonising sympathy with evil-doers; and it was sometimes said in Aberalva,--"Don't do that, for poor Grace's sake. She bears the sins of all the parish." ...|$|R
60|$|Her love {{might have}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{wish to do}} {{everything}} for her that she now began to do, but it simplified the situation to account for her {{to the world as}} the ward of Mrs. Lander, who was as rich as she was vulgar, and it was with Clementina in this character that Miss Milray began to make the round of afternoon teas, and inspired invitations for her at pleasant houses, by giving a young ladies' lunch for her at her own. Before the night of her little dance, she had lost any misgiving she had felt at first, in the delight of seeing Clementina take the world as if she had thought it would always behave as amiably as that, and as if she had forgotten her unkind experiences to the contrary. She knew from Mrs. Lander how the girls at their hotel had left her out, but Miss Milray could not see that Clementina met them with rancor, when her authority brought them together. If the child was humiliated by her past in the gross lonely luxury of Mrs. Lander's life or the unconscious poverty of her own home, she did not show it {{in the presence of the}} world that now opened its arms to her. She remained so tranquil in the midst of all the novel differences, that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> friend <b>feel</b> rather vulgar in her anxieties for her, and it was not always enough to find that she had not gone wrong simply because she had hold still, and had the gift of waiting for things to happen. Sometimes when Miss Milray had almost decided that her passivity was the calm of a savage, she betrayed so sweet and grateful a sense of all that was done for her, that her benefactress decided that, she was not rustic, but was sylvan in a way of her own, and not so much ignorant as innocent. She discovered that she was not ignorant even of books, but with no literary effect from them she had transmitted her reading into the substance of her native gentleness, and had both ideas and convictions. When Clementina most affected her as an untried wilderness in the conventional things she most felt her equality to any social fortune that might befall her, and then she would have liked to see her married to a title, and taking the glory of this world with an unconsciousness that experience would never wholly penetrate. But then again she felt that this would be somehow a profanation, and she wanted to pack her up and get her back to Middlemount before anything of the kind should happen. She gave Milray these impressions of Clementina in the letter she wrote to thank him for her, and to scold him for sending the girl to her. She accused him of wishing to get off on her a riddle which he could not read himself; but she owned that the charm of Clementina's mystery was worth a thousand times the fatigue of trying to guess her out and that she was more and more infatuated with her every day.|$|R

6000|$|There {{was nothing}} to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the Park and he struck her as giving, unexpectedly, the go-by to any serious search for the Principino. The way they sat down awhile in the sun {{was a sign of}} that; his {{dropping}} with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little, after they were placed, as if now at last she might bring out, as between them, something more specific. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> but <b>feel</b> the more sharply how the specific, in almost any direction, was utterly forbidden her--how the use of it would be, for all the world, like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent. It would come out, the specific, where the dog would come out; would run to earth, somehow, the truth--for she was believing herself in relation to the truth!--at which she mustn't so much as indirectly point. Such, at any rate, was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger, reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at, and yet having to make it evident, while she recognised them, that she didn't wince. There were moments between them, in their chairs, when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up. There were pauses during which, with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine, she might yet, as at some hard game, over a table, for money, have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness. She was positively proud, afterwards, of the great style in which she had kept this up; later on, at the hour's end, when they had retraced their steps to find Amerigo and Charlotte awaiting them at the house, she was able to say to herself that, truly, she had put her plan through; even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation, every minute of the time, not fall below the standard of that other hour, in the treasured past, which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum, a high watermark for the history of their old fortune; the summer evening, in the park at Fawns, when, side by side under the trees just as now, they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone. There had been the possibility of a trap for her, at present, in the very question of their taking up anew that residence; wherefore she had not been the first to sound it, in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do. She was saying to herself in secret: [...] "CAN we again, in this form, migrate there? Can I, for myself, undertake it? face all the intenser keeping-up and stretching-out, indefinitely, impossibly, that our conditions in the country, as we've established and accepted them, would stand for?" [...] She had positively lost herself in this inward doubt--so much she was subsequently to remember; but remembering then too that her companion, though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager, had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in Eaton Square after the banquet to the Castledeans.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} the {{absolute}} carelessness of her manner, the quiet assumption that she was outside the usual conventionalities of life. It is a manner only to be met in English life, {{among some of the}} highest of the high world, and some of the highest of the half world. It was new to Maude, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> uncomfortable, while mingled with it there was something else which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> {{for the first time in}} her life that she had incurred the hostility of a fellow- mortal. <b>It</b> chilled <b>her,</b> and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> unhappy.|$|R
60|$|Yet she was {{far from}} happy.
