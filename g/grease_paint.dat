5|$|At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam Knight won the Silver Medal in Painting {{with the}} {{painting}} Boxer (1917), {{one of the}} series she had painted at Witley in 1916. In 1929 Knight was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University. Knight {{was elected president of}} the Society of Women Artists in 1932 and held the post until 1967. In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the Royal Academy. The same year Knight published her first autobiography, Oil Paint and <b>Grease</b> <b>Paint,</b> which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a Penguin paperback printing.|$|E
2500|$|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson recounts how Jack Buckland, {{inadvertently}} {{caused a}} {{fire on the}} Janet Nicoll. In Auckland, New Zealand, Jack Buckland purchased ten pound of ‘calcium fire’ (fireworks); cartridges, <b>grease</b> <b>paint,</b> and false nose and a wig for the entertainment of the islanders at Jack's trading station on Nonouti atoll. However, on leaving harbour the ‘calcium fire’, which was promised by the chemist to be [...] "safe as a packet of sugar", spontaneously caught alight causing the fireworks to explode in technicolour flashes endangering the ship – until the crew put out the fire.|$|E
2500|$|The orange man {{was portrayed}} by serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves; the advert's co-creator Al Young {{recalled}} that [...] "the guy we used [...] {{was like a}} Shakespearean actor," [...] and noted that out of all who auditioned for the role, [...] "he {{was the one who}} made [...] laugh the most," [...] adding that the way he ran [...] "was surreal". Robinson recalled, [...] "We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect." [...] Geeves recalled in 2006, [...] "I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was at that point I thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'." [...] The orange paint on him was orange <b>grease</b> <b>paint</b> fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming. Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor {{in the role of the}} Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would [...] "make it look real".|$|E

50|$|A {{grease gun}} injury or {{injection}} injury is an injury caused by high-pressure injection of oil, grease, solvents, water, or even air, into the body. The most common causes are accidents with <b>grease</b> guns, <b>paint</b> sprayers, and pressure washers, but pinhole leaks in pressurized hydraulic lines occasionally cause this injury. Additionally, {{there is at}} least one known case of deliberate self-injection with a grease gun.|$|R
40|$|This tenth {{compilation}} of outgassing data of materials intended for spacecraft use supersedes Reference Publication 1124, Revision 2, November 1990. The {{data were obtained}} at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), utilizing equipment developed at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) under contract to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). SRI personnel developed an apparatus for determining the mass loss in vacuum and for collecting the outgassed products. The outgassing data have been presented in three different ways {{in order to facilitate}} material selection. In Section A, the materials are divided by category into the 18 probable uses, such as adhesives, <b>greases,</b> <b>paints,</b> potting compounds, and so forth. In Section B, all the materials contained in Section A are listed in alphabetical order by the manufacturer's identification. In Section C, the only materials listed are those having 'Total Mass Loss' (TML) and Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) equal to or lower than a maximum 1. 0 percent TML and a maximum 0. 10 percent CVCM. These are grouped by use, as in Section A...|$|R

60|$|When he waked {{he listened}} for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer, {{wondering}} why his stateroom had grown so small. Turning, he looked into a narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge square beam. A three-cornered table within arm's reach ran from {{the angle of the}} bows to the foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used Plymouth stove, sat a boy about his own age, with a flat red face and a pair of twinkling grey eyes. He was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber boots. Several pairs of the same sort of foot-wear, an old cap, and some worn-out woolen socks lay on the floor, and black and yellow oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was packed as full of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the smells of fried fish, burnt <b>grease,</b> <b>paint,</b> pepper, and stale tobacco; but these, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets on his bed-place. He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was not that of a steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt {{at the end of a}} halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and whined about him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his mother.|$|E

He {{claimed to have been}} first taught how to make paint by a native American {{childhood}} friend who demonstrated how paint could be made by mixing clay with bear <b>grease.</b> This <b>painting</b> has fine detail on the native figure, whose plucked scalp and tattoos are shown in more detail than the Europeans' uniforms. West is known to have had a collection of North American artefacts which he used in his paintings.|$|R
30|$|Each {{field of}} life depends on fluids such as water, milk, juices, blood, glycerin, <b>grease,</b> <b>paints,</b> oils, polymer solutions, etc. and their direct or {{indirect}} motions. For most of these fluids, a linear stress-strain relationship does not exist [1] and the classical Navier–Stokes equation cannot describe their behavior. There are lots of fluid models in literature depending upon their response under different circumstances. Among them, the model that has received more attention is the rate type fluid model. The first rate type model, which is viscoelastic and still utilized generally, was given by Maxwell [2]. Although Maxwell developed this model for air, not for polymeric liquids, his methodology {{can be summed up}} to provide a plethora of models. Rajagopal and Srinivasa [3] developed a comprehensive thermodynamic framework by using the concept of Maxwell’s work, which provides a base for making a class of rate type viscoelastic fluids. In the presence of transverse magnetic field, Nayak [4] studied both the heat and mass flow rate of viscous fluid through a medium which is porous considering both heat source and sink. Shateyi [5] used a numerical approach to study the MHD flow of a Maxwell fluid past a stretching plate in the presence of chemical reaction. Shah et al. [6] analyzed the unsteady flow of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) second grade fluid over a stretching sheet by using similarity transformations.|$|R
5000|$|Comanche men {{usually had}} pierced ears with hanging {{earrings}} made from pieces of shell or loops of brass or silver wire. A female relative would pierce {{the outer edge}} of the ear with six or eight holes. The men also tattooed their face, arms, and chest with geometric designs, and painted their face and body. Traditionally they used paints made from berry juice and the colored clays of the Comancheria. Later, traders supplied them with vermilion (red pigment) and bright <b>grease</b> <b>paints.</b> Comanche men also wore bands of leather and strips of metal on their arms. Except for black, which was the color for war, there was no standard color or pattern for face and body painting: it was a matter of individual preference. For example, one Comanche might paint one side of his face white and the other side red; another might paint one side of his body green and the other side with green and black stripes. One Comanche might always paint himself in a particular way, while another might change the colors and designs when so inclined. Some designs had special meaning to the individual, and special colors and designs might have been revealed in a dream. Comanche women might also tattoo their face or arms. They were fond of painting their bodies and were free to paint themselves however they pleased. A popular pattern among the women was to paint the insides of their ears a bright red and paint great orange and red circles on their cheeks. They usually painted red and yellow around their lips.|$|R

5000|$|Rubbing with a {{slightly}} moistened foam may remove otherwise [...] "uncleanable" [...] external markings from surfaces. For example, melamine foam can remove crayon, marker pen, and <b>grease</b> from <b>painted</b> walls and wood finishings, plastic-adhering paints from treated wooden tables, and adhesive residue and grime from hubcaps. If the surface being cleaned is not sufficiently hard, it may be finely scratched by the melamine material. The foam wears away, rather like a pencil eraser, leaving behind a slight residue which can be rinsed off. The material is also sold as an effective dental stain remover for private use. It is however warned to not use it on dental fillings as their surface may lose its shine.|$|R
30|$|There {{has been}} great deal of {{interest}} in understanding the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids [1, 2]. Examples of such rheological complex fluids are blood plasma, chocolate, mustard mayonnaise, tooth paste, shampoo, food stuffs, mud, polymer melts, clay coatings, oils and <b>greases,</b> <b>paints</b> etc. These kinds of fluids offer special challenges to the engineers, modelers, mathematicians, and physicists. The study of non-Newtonian fluids {{is very important in}} view of its applications in various branches of engineering and technology, therefore the flow analysis of these fluids is very important in theory and practice. From a theoretical point of view, flows of this type are fundamental in fluid mechanics. Practically speaking, these flows have applications in many manufacturing processes in industry. Due to the great diversity in the physical structures of non-Newtonian fluids, {{it is not possible to}} establish a single constitutive equation. Thus, many non-Newtonian fluid models have been proposed of which most are empirical or semi-empirical. The equations of motion for non-Newtonian fluids are much more complicated and are of higher order than the Navier-Stokes equations. The solutions of most of the problems in the real world are usually even numerical, on computers. However, analytical solutions, even if they may not be accurate, can provide some penetrating insight into the physics of a problem which manages a maze of numbers crunched on a computer. For that reason, researchers still look for analytical solutions of the known and unknown problems, particularly the former, as they can act as a bench mark for the latter. Various analytical and numerical approaches/methods by a number of people with and without slip condition [3 – 26] have been done.|$|R
50|$|Pierre Wertheimer's father, Ernest, had {{emigrated from}} Alsace to Paris in 1870. In Paris the elder Wertheimer {{purchased}} {{an interest in}} the theatrical make-up company Bourjois. Bourjois, an innovator in these products for the stage, developed the first dry rouge, an improvement over the <b>grease</b> laden face <b>paint</b> customarily used. By 1920, Bourjois had become the largest and most successful cosmetic and fragrance company in France. Not restricted to the European continent, Bourjois was an international enterprise with corporate holdings in America. Their facility in Rochester, New York manufactured and distributed the Helena Rubinstein line of face creams. Maintaining Bourjois as a family business, Pierre Wertheimer and his brother Paul took over the directorship of the company in 1917.|$|R

30|$|The real {{extent of}} damage in {{high-pressure}} injection injuries (<b>grease</b> gun injuries, <b>paint</b> gun injuries, pressure gun in juries) is {{hidden behind a}} small and frequently painless punctiform skin lesion on the finger or the hand. These kinds of injuries require prompt surgical intervention with surgical debridement of all ischemic tissue. Possibility of a general intoxication by the fluid must always be ruled out. Postoperative intensive physiotherapy {{is essential for the}} final hand function. The initial benign aspect is frequently causing a delay for an adequate treatment while in the mean time the possibility for subcutaneous damage continuously increases. Because of this delay the chance of permanent reduced functionality in the hand or finger amputation raises. Not only the latency time to adequate treatment but also the injected fluid’s nature, the pressure, the volume and the location of injection, has influence on the seriousness and extensiveness of subcutaneous damage. All these factors influence the functional outcome of the patient.|$|R
