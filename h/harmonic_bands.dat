40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and experimental studies on nonlinear beam propagation in lithium niobate waveguide arrays utilizing higher-order second <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands.</b> We {{find that the}} implementation of the higher-order second <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> leads to a number of new effects. The combined interaction of two second <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> with a propagating fundamental beam can lead to a complete inhibition of nonlinear effects or to the formation of discrete spatial solitons, depending only on the wavelength of the fundamental wave. Furthermore we analyze the properties of discrete solitons, allowing for linear coupling of the second harmonic.

40|$|Coded {{excitation}} methods {{offer the}} potential for improving the SNR without increasing the peak transmitted power and without sacrificing resolution. Our study examines the potential application of coded waveforms, specifically FM chirps, in harmonic imaging. Such a system, in which nonlinear echoes from tissue are used to form the image, requires the extraction and compression of the second harmonic portion of the echo signal. Our objective is to obtain the second harmonic using just one transmission, thereby avoiding problems of frame rate reduction and movement artifacts associated with multiple transmission schemes. With {{the help of an}} efficient method for predicting the transient nonlinear field from a focused transducer, design issues such as waveform and bandwidth selection, as well as filters for second harmonic extraction and compression are examined. Simulations reveal the presence of axial sidelobes in the compressed echo waveform as the bandwidth of the transmitted chirp is increased. These sidelobes, resulting from the overlap of the fundamental and third <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> with the second harmonic, cannot be removed using conventional Fourier filtering. Alternative filtering techniques which utilize the separation of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> of a backscattered chirp in the joint time-frequency domain are suggested. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear wave {{propagation}} has, {{for the last}} couple of decades, become an increasingly more important tool in medical ultrasound imaging. Creating ultrasound images from echoes in the second <b>harmonic</b> frequency <b>band</b> provides a major enhancement to the image quality, reducing body wall reverberation and also reducing perturbations from off-axis echoes. The aim of this study has been to make a fast implementation of nonlinear wave simulation in ultrasound, based on the Propose method, and investigate its agreement with the state-of-the art simulation tool, Abersim. Agreement between the methods has been investigated for a typical cardiac probe in the fundamental and second <b>harmonic</b> frequency <b>band.</b> The comparison showed good agreement for phase, amplitude, wave form and beam profile. Some overestimation of the center lobe in the beam profile was found, but this is expected for quasilinear methods.

When the cold electron density is larger than the hot, nonconvective instability is possible only in that band containing the cold upper-hybrid frequency.

A subharmonic modulation method using two modulating waves is introduced. It is particularly well {{adapted to the}} elimination of specific <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands.</b> Systematic optimization of precalculated wave forms with respect to loss factor shows that three-level PWM is very well suited to harmonic reduction. Transient behavior is discussed. It is concluded that three-level PWM yields significant improvements compared with two-level PWM, especially in high-power (gate-turn-off) GTO applications where the high DC link voltage requires a series connection of the switches.

Conventional smoothed spectrum is used in the non-harmonic band. The mixed spectrum undergoes melscaled band-pass filtering, and the log-energy of the filters' output is discrete cosine transformed to produce cepstral coefficients.

In the primary alcohols and in o-chlor phenol the O[Single Bond]H vibration was found to split into two components, a possible explanation for which is briefly discussed.

A pseudorandom placement of the components within the band ensured that no two sounds were identical. The data suggested that discrimination is primarily based upon the perception of temporal fluctuations in the intensity of the sound and secondarily upon resolved structure in the spectrum, perceived as tone color.

These harmonic components were earlier attributed to a nonlinear instrumental response to the strong wide-band bursty AKR fundamental signal. Evidence is here presented that indicates that these harmonics are of natural origin, namely: (1) all the harmonic signals are sometimes observed to have nearly the same bandwidth, (2) when the fundamental signal has two components the harmonic signal sometimes corresponds to the weaker rather than the stronger component, (3) a weak harmonic can be observed {{to be associated with}} a weak fundamental, and (4) a 'harmonic' signal can be observed when there is no fundamental...|$|E

Some torrent-living frogs of the genera Odorrana and Huia emit ultrasounds to avoid masking by environment noise.

To examine this possibility, we analyzed call structures of two horned toads, Megophrys kuatunensis and M. huangshanensis, which inhabit along streams in eastern China. We investigated variation in call properties within and between the two species and found that the two species show similar call structures but significantly differ in note duration and inter-note interval.

When the ratio of cold to hot electron temperature is small, the cold upper hybrid frequency controls the <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> that can be nonconvectively stable. When this ratio increases above a few times 0. 01, nonconvective instability disappears simultaneously for each harmonic band, when the density ratio is less than unity.

The principle is to combine three frequency bands to form one wide frequency range. The three bands consist of second <b>harmonic</b> <b>bands</b> from two VCOs and a mixer band that is generated by mixing the two fundamental signals of VCOs to bridge the frequency gap. Apart from the wide tuning range, an additional benefit of a mixer-based signal source is that the phase-noise increases âˆ¼ 3 dB/octave, which {{is less than the}} theoretical limit (6 dB/octave) for a fundamental frequency VCO followed by a frequency multiplier or extraction of second harmonic signal from a VCO. A prototype of the proposed signal source implemented in indium gallium phosphide hetero junction bipolar transistor monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology demonstrates both wide frequency tuning range and a very low phase noise.
