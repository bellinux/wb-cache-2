5000|$|The National Maritime Authority (Autoridade Marítima Nacional) or AMN is {{the public}} body {{responsible}} for most of the coast guard type activities in Portugal, including the security, safety, life-guard, lighthouses and pollution fighting at sea. For hundreds of years and until 2014, the maritime authority role in Portugal was performed by the Navy, with the AMN constituting a branch of it. However, due to the constitutional issues of having a branch of the Armed Forces performing an internal security role, the AMN was separated from the Navy in 2014, being now formally an entire separate organization. However, although legally separate, the AMN and the Navy organizations still override in many aspects.

An element crucial to these discussions is whether moonlighting is detrimental for politicians’ performance. In Belgium, the combination of local executive and regional legislative offices, i. e. <b>double</b> <b>hat</b> politicians, is a frequent habit {{for a majority of}} politicians. This accumulation of activities might lead to (un-) desirable outcomes in terms of political achievements. This paper investigates the impact of holding several remunerated and honorary positions on regional MPs parliamentary activities and mayor’s municipality performance in Wallonia. I use a database of all public and private positions held by Belgian politicians in Wallonia since the disclosure of positions became compulsory for those holding at least one public position, i. e. from 2004 to 2016. For members of Parliament, wearing a <b>double</b> <b>hat</b> reduces global parliamentary activity.

In a <b>double</b> <b>hatted</b> appointment, he served concurrently as non-resident Ambassador to Guinea. On 6 May 2000—less than a week into Jones' term in Sierra Leone—rebel fighters belonging to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) blocked the road connecting the capital, Freetown, to the country's main airport, Lungi. The following day, British forces deployed to the country in preparation for an evacuation of foreign citizens. Jones—who had been delegated political authority over the operation—ordered the commencement of the evacuation the next day (8 May), and it began almost immediately. British forces {{then went on to}} conduct a large-scale intervention, aimed at ending the civil war and assisting the United Nations peacekeeping force in the country. Nine days into their deployment (17 May), British forces were involved in what became their only direct engagement with the RUF, the Lungi Lol confrontation, in which the rebels engaged British soldiers who were securing the airport. Later in Jones' term, in September 2000, a group of 11 British soldiers were taken prisoner by a militia group. Five soldiers were eventually released through negotiation, but—as concerns for the remaining six mounted—Jones was granted political authority to order a rescue operation in an emergency. The soldiers were later freed in Operation Barras, an assault spearheaded by British special forces.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} member states' policy {{effectiveness}} in the European Union, using Luxembourg's capacity {{to get what}} it wanted in three crucial areas as a case study. Policy effectiveness {{is defined as the}} successful exercise of a member state's ability to include most of its policy preferences into the final legislation. The factors considered to influence policy effectiveness include the negotiation context, more specifically the decision-making procedure and time pressure. The distribution and intensity of other member states and holding the Presidency are also expected to play a role. Furthermore, individual-level factors such as experience, past relations or belonging to the same political family are rarely systematically included in research, but these are also included. Finally domestic politics, such as the approval procedure and institutional coordination are considered. The decision making process, especially within the Council, is still a black box to most scholars - a challenge which in this research is met by elite interviews with the negotiators involved, by process tracing and by document analysis. I empirically assess three cases where Luxembourg is reputed to have been policy effective: the creation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in 1996, the reform of the same in 2005, and the payment of unemployment benefits to frontier workers (EC Regulation 883 / 2004). In terms of Luxembourg's policy effectiveness, I find the following: 1) that Luxembourg was highly policy effective {{in the creation of the}} SGP, due to Jean- Claude Juncker's <b>double</b> <b>hat</b> of Finance Minister and Prime Minister, as well as his expertise and his personal relations with other Heads of State. 2) In the reform of the SGP, that Luxembourg was not policy effective despite holding the Presidency; Juncker was President of the Eurogroup and still had that same <b>double</b> <b>hat.</b> The widely distributed and intense preferences of France and Germany combined to produce an agreement which Luxembourg did not favour, but had nevertheless helped to produce. 3) Finally, that, in Regulation 883 / 2004, Luxembourg was medium policy effective because of domestic constraints, a low distribution and intensity of preferences of the other member states and because of unanimity. All of my case studies show evidence of two developments in terms of decision-making processes: the shift of decision-making from public to informal arenas, and the involvement of the European Council in areas which are not formally within its competence. Indeed, the compromises found were proposed in the Council of Ministers after several key member states had seen and agreed to them beforehand. Incidentally, the evidence also indicates that the European Parliament did not influence the legislative outcome at all in these cases. These results suggest several practical guidelines for member states...|$|E
