5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary boulders and <b>indentations</b> in rocks; the boulders {{were said to be}} thrown by him from a hill, and the <b>indentations</b> were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E
5|$|The Khoikhoi herders {{produced}} the geometric imagery, probably depicting herder groups. They {{are also the}} creators of the more worldly <b>indentations</b> in that area that served as grinding hollows and game boards. Some of the stones bear marks from use as gong stones; they make unusual sounds when hit.|$|E
5|$|The Slavic people cremated their dead, {{typical for}} the {{inhabitants}} of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground <b>indentations.</b> The number of burial sites found is small {{in relation to the}} known settlement density. The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (swine, sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent).|$|E
30|$|In dry <b>indentation,</b> the hardness-indentation {{depth curve}} {{exhibits}} the reverse <b>indentation</b> size effect. In wet <b>indentation,</b> the curve exhibits the regular <b>indentation</b> size effect.|$|R
30|$|However, {{for both}} 10 and 100  m/s speeds, the <b>indentation</b> force for dry <b>indentation</b> starts to {{overtake}} that for wet <b>indentation</b> when the <b>indentation</b> depth reaches 3.3  nm. This phenomenon {{can be attributed}} to the change of friction force between the indenter and the work material due to the addition of water. When the <b>indentation</b> depth is less than a critical value, the resultant reduction of <b>indentation</b> force is too small to compensate the resistant force of water molecules between the indenter and the work material. When the <b>indentation</b> depth is beyond the critical value, the beneficial tribological effect is sufficient to compensate the resistant force. As a result, the <b>indentation</b> force in the late stage for wet <b>indentation</b> is smaller than that for dry <b>indentation.</b>|$|R
30|$|In dry <b>indentation,</b> {{the maximum}} <b>indentation</b> force {{increases}} from 468.0 to 549.7  eV/Å as the <b>indentation</b> speed increases from 10 to 100  m/s. In wet <b>indentation,</b> the maximum <b>indentation</b> force increases from 423.2 to 565.6  eV/Å {{with the same}} increase of speed. However, the increase of <b>indentation</b> force is much less significant when the speed increases from 1 to 10  m/s.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep <b>indentations</b> surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven <b>indentations</b> to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by <b>indentations</b> called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
40|$|In {{computer}} programming languages, <b>indentation</b> formats program source code to improve readability.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to design and develop a noninvasive corneal <b>indentation</b> method to measure the corneal {{hysteresis}} behavior under dynamic corneal <b>indentation.</b> Corneal <b>indentation</b> method is adapted for the design and development of a measurement method for the characterization of Corneal <b>Indentation</b> Hysteresis (CIH). Fourteen porcine eyes were tested using the corneal <b>indentation</b> method. The CIH measured in enucleated porcine eyes showed <b>indentation</b> rate and intraocular pressure dependences. The CIH increased with the <b>indentation</b> rate at lower IOP ( 25 mmHg). The CIH was linear proportional to the IOP within an individual eye. The CIH was positively correlated with the IOP, corneal in-plane tensile stress and corneal tangent modulus (E). A new method based on corneal <b>indentation</b> for the measurement of Corneal <b>Indentation</b> Hysteresis in vivo is developed.

40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was used to study the effect of the angle between the loading direction and the axisymmetric direction on the <b>indentation</b> behavior of a transversely isotropic piezoelectric half-space by a cylindrical indenter of flat end. Two cases were considered in the analysis, which included (a) the <b>indentation</b> by an insulating indenter, and (b) the <b>indentation</b> by a conducting indenter. Both the <b>indentation</b> load and the indentation-induced potential were found to be proportional to the <b>indentation</b> depth. Using the simulation results and the analytical relationship for the <b>indentation</b> by a rigid, insulating indenter, semi-analytical relationships were developed between the <b>indentation</b> load and the <b>indentation</b> depth and between the indentation-induced potential on the indenter and the <b>indentation</b> depth for the conducting indenter, respectively. The proportionality between the indentation-induced potential and the <b>indentation</b> depth is only a function of the angle between the loading direction and the poling direction, independent of the type of indenters, which may be used to measure the relative direction of the loading axis to the axisymmetric axis of transversely piezoelectric materials from the <b>indentation</b> test...|$|R
5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted <b>indentations</b> on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small <b>indentations</b> {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many <b>indentations</b> and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerous <b>indentation</b> {{tests in}} the {{micrometer}} and nanometer scale {{have shown that the}} measured hardness decreases significantly with increasing <b>indentation</b> depth, and this is known as the <b>indentation</b> size effect (ISE). However, several other nanoindentation results for polycrystalline materials show that the <b>indentation</b> hardness increases with increasing <b>indentation</b> depth because of the grain boundary (GB) effect. In this work, we propose a new model for the <b>indentation</b> test using the modified strain gradient plasticity theory. The GB effect is considered by evaluating the density of GNDs on the GB. Using the proposed model, the <b>indentation</b> hardness of polycrystalline materials in micrometer-scale structures is investigated, and compared with experimental results from other researchers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{instrumented}} <b>indentation</b> tests are useful tools in probing mechanical properties of materials such as metals and ceramics. Instrumented <b>indentation</b> of hyperelastic materials such as rubbers, bio-materials, tissues etc has not been examined in depth, especially the inverse problem of material characterization from instrumented <b>indentation</b> response. The difficulty of the inverse problem for such materials is that the unknown property is a function, the elastic energy density function. There are several such functions and each function is often characterized by more than one parameter. If the maximum <b>indentation</b> depth is low, we have shown that instrumented <b>indentation</b> of initially unstretched hyperelastic materials can only resolve a combination of the material parameters. If the maximum <b>indentation</b> depth is high, the <b>indentation</b> can provide independent material properties, however not in a unique way. Moreover, high <b>indentation</b> loads could lead to surface puncturing and so blur the test results. In this work, we show that we can use spherical <b>indentation</b> of a substrate at different but known prestretch levels to obtain the involved material properties of the energy density function. The present methodology can also incorporate a limit energy failure criterion and instrumented <b>indentation</b> can incorporate this behavior which we may call <b>indentation</b> strength.

40|$|Abstract. The {{instrumented}} <b>indentation</b> technique (IIT) {{has recently}} attracted significant research interest {{because it is}} nondestructive and easy to perform, and can characterize materials on local scales. Residual stress can be determined by analyzing the <b>indentation</b> load-depth curve from IIT. However, this technique using a symmetric indenter is limited to an equibiaxial residual stress state. In this study, we determine the directionality of the non-equibiaxial residual stress by using the Knoop <b>indentation</b> technique. Different <b>indentation</b> load-depth curves are obtained at non-equibiaxial residual stresses depending on the Knoop <b>indentation</b> direction. A model for Knoop <b>indentation</b> was developed through experiments and theoretical analysis...|$|R

30|$|Nano/micro-manufacturing under wet {{condition}} {{is an important}} consideration for various tool-based processes such as <b>indentation,</b> scratching, and machining. The existence of liquids adds complexity to the system, changes the tool/work interfacial condition, and affects material behaviors. For <b>indentation,</b> it may also affect material property measurements. However, little effort {{has been made to}} study this challenging issue at nano- or atomistic scale. In this study, we tackle this challenge by investigating nano-indentation processes submerged in water using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. Compared with dry <b>indentation</b> in which no water molecules are present, the existence of water molecules causes the increase of <b>indentation</b> force in initial penetration, but the decrease of <b>indentation</b> force in full penetration. It also reduces the sticking phenomenon between the work and tool atoms during indenter retraction, such that the <b>indentation</b> geometry can be better retained. Meanwhile, nano-indentation under {{wet condition}} exhibits the <b>indentation</b> size effect, while dry nano-indentation exhibits the reverse <b>indentation</b> size effect. The existence of water leads to higher computed hardness values at low <b>indentation</b> loads and a smaller value of Young's modulus. In addition, the friction along the tool/work interface is significantly reduced under wet <b>indentation.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the basic concepts of scaling and dimensional analysis, followed by a review of some of the recent work on applying these concepts to modeling instrumented <b>indentation</b> measurements. Specifically, we examine conical and pyramidal <b>indentation</b> in elastic–plastic solids with power-law work-hardening, in power-law creep solids, and in linear viscoelastic materials. We show that the scaling approach to <b>indentation</b> modeling provides new insights into several basic questions in instrumented <b>indentation,</b> including, what information is contained in the <b>indentation</b> load–displacement curves? How does hardness depend on the mechanical properties and indenter geometry? What are the factors determining piling-up and sinking-in of surface profiles around indents? Can stress–strain relationships be obtained from <b>indentation</b> load–displacement curves? How to measure time dependent mechanical properties from <b>indentation?</b> How to detect or confirm <b>indentation</b> size effects? The scaling approach also helps organize knowledge and provides a framework for bridging micro- and macro-scales. We hope that this review will accomplish two purposes: (1) introducing the basic concepts of scaling and dimensional analysis to materials scientists and engineers, and (2) providing a better understanding of instrumented <b>indentation</b> measurements...|$|R
