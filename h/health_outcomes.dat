5|$|Currently, {{women in}} India face a {{multitude}} of health problems, which ultimately affect the aggregate economy’s output.

5|$|Gender {{is one of}} {{the main}} social {{determinants}} of health—which include social, economic, and political factors—that play a major role in the <b>health</b> <b>outcomes</b> of women in India.

40|$|Background: Despite clear health {{benefits}} of physical activity, previous research has been limited in linking knowledge of physical activity recommendations to actual behavior. Methods: Using Expectancy Theory, we examined whether an individual’s <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies from physical activity might provide the missing link between knowledge and behavior. With data from a cross-sectional survey, we assessed differ-ences between how much moderate physical activity people thought they needed for {{health benefits}} compared with what they thought experts recommended {{and the relationship of}} these differences to physical activity behaviors. Results: Our hypothesis that people with positive <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies would report more minutes of physical activity than those with neutral or negative <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies was supported for all self-reported physical activity behaviors (P <. 001). Conclusions: It appears that the <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy of needing more physical activity than recommended by experts is correlated with achieving more physical activity, regardless of type. Future research should address <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies as a way to impact physical activity...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{increasing}} availability of multidimensional <b>health</b> status and <b>outcome</b> {{measures of the}} patient's physical and emotional functioning, {{and a number of}} national initiatives to promote their use, {{little is known about the}} attitudes and behaviour of general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs) regarding their use in evaluating the effectiveness of health care. What evidence there is remains largely anecdotal but supports the view that <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> data is currently not used in the routine management of the patient. AIM: To investigate the attitudes and behaviour of GPs and PNs regarding the use of <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> data in the routine care of patients with diabetes. METHOD: A questionnaire comprising 20 attitudinal and behavioural statements covering the use and benefits of <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> data in the routine care of patients with diabetes were sent to 156 GPs and 114 PNs in the Doncaster area together with a covering letter and two examples of multidimensional <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> measures. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were received from 90 (58 %) GPs and 49 (50 % corrected for out of scope) nurses. Median response scores showed that both GPs and nurses expressed a positive overall attitude towards <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> measurement giving responses favourable to it in 15 (75 %) and 18 (90 %) of the statements respectively. A key finding was that 48 % and 46 % of GPs and PNs were unclear as to how they would use <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> data. CONCLUSION: While our findings reflect a favourable view towards the use of <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> data for the routine management of the patient with diabetes in a general practice setting, a number of important barriers to their implementation have been identified. These include insufficient knowledge on their use, the need for easily interpretable data, and a lack of resources...|$|R

The objective was to identify predictors of poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> at 10 years of follow-up in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Prospective cohort study. Population-based sample from 6 U. S. communities. 4, 355 participants In the MESA Study. Poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> at 10 years of follow-up was defined as having died or having clinical cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. Absolute risk regression was used to estimate risk differences in the outcome adjusting for demographic variables, clinical and behavioral risk factors, subclinical cardiovascular disease, and ApoE genotype. Models were weighted to account for selective attrition. Mean age at 10 years of follow-up was 69. 5 years; 1, 480 participants had a poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome,</b> 2, 157 participants were in good health, and 718 were unknown. Older age, smoking, not taking a statin, hypertension, diabetes, and higher coronary calcium score were associated with higher probability of poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome.</b> After multivariable adjustment, participants in the lowest income and educational categories had 7 to 14 % greater absolute risk of poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> at 10 years of follow-up compared {{to those in the}} next highest categories of income or education (P = 0. 002 for both). Those in the lowest categories of both income and education had 21 % greater absolute risk of poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> compared to those in the highest categories of both income and education.

5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner.

5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women.

The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{have shown}} that the nature and quality of coping may {{positively}} or negatively affect health outcome; however, this relationship has not been well studied among patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Objectives: The primary objective was to study the effect of different coping strategies on the <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> of women with GI disorders and how these coping strategies may modify the effects of education, GI disease type, neuroticism, and abuse severity on <b>health</b> <b>outcome.</b> Methods: We followed 174 patients in a referral GI clinic for 12 months to assess their health status as a derived variable of daily pain, bed disability days, psychological distress, daily dysfunction, number of visits to physicians, and number of surgeries and procedures. We obtained at baseline their GI diagnosis (functional vs. organic), neuroticism score (NEO Personality Inventory), sexual and/or physical abuse history, and scores on two coping questionnaires. Regressions analyses were used to determine the relative effect of the coping measures on <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> and their modifying effects on education, GI disease type, neuroticism, and abuse severity. Results: A higher score on the Catastrophizing scale and a lower score on the Self-Perceived Ability to Decrease Symptoms scale (Coping Strategies Questionnaire) predicted poor <b>health</b> <b>outcome.</b> Less education, a functional GI diagnosis, a higher neuroticism score, and greater abuse severity also contributed to poor health status. However, the effect of GI disease type and neuroticism on <b>health</b> <b>outcome</b> was significantly reduced by the coping measures.
