5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in {{point-to-point}} rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} desktop {{publishing}} {{made it possible}} for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital imagesetters enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from <b>digital</b> <b>input,</b> skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital platesetter during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from <b>digital</b> <b>input,</b> a process known as computer to plate printing.|$|E

Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices.

25|$|In April 2006, the SDA {{released}} a detailed specification for the non-security related {{parts of the}} SD memory card standard and for the Secure <b>Digital</b> <b>Input</b> Output (SDIO) cards and the standard SD host controller.|$|E
25|$|A SDIO (Secure <b>Digital</b> <b>Input</b> Output) card is an {{extension}} of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, barcode readers, FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras, and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and IrDA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.|$|E
25|$|This codec {{incorporated}} into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system {{was based on a}} two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery's team (CCETT, France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using {{for the first time a}} 48kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.|$|E

500|$|Like the Dual Analog, the DualShock and DualShock 2 feature an [...] "Analog" [...] button {{between the}} analog sticks that toggles the analog sticks {{on and off}} (for use with games which support only the <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> of the {{original}} controller). On the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the analog sticks are always enabled. Beginning with the Sixaxis, a 'PlayStation button' (which featured the incorporated PS logo and is similar in function to the Xbox 360 [...] "Guide" [...] button) was included on controllers. The PlayStation button replaces the [...] "Analog" [...] button of the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers. Pressing the PS button on the PS3 brings up the XMB, while holding it down brings up system options (such as quit the game, change controller settings, turn off the system, and turn off the controller).|$|E

50|$|Central {{controllers}} {{and most}} terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the {{direct digital control}} program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, setpoints, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and <b>digital</b> <b>inputs</b> that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and analog and digital outputs {{for control of the}} transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). <b>Digital</b> <b>inputs</b> are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device.
