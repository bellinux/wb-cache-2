5|$|On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee (Komitet Obywatelski) {{was formed}} within Solidarity. It {{comprised}} several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wałęsa {{and the majority}} of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wałęsa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> any action.|$|E
5|$|Place d'Armes {{is one of}} {{the largest}} squares in the city of Calais, adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a {{territory}} of England (1347–1558), it became known as Market Square (place du Marché). Only at the end of English rule <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> the name of Place d'Armes. After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square, which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive {{that began in the}} waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of {{the fourth quarter}}. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell {{completed}} a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33seconds and two plays to travel 58yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just two plays to score, so too <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> Virginia Tech two plays to answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking over at his team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver David Clowney. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a two-point conversion on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and two-point conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.|$|E

500|$|The Allied {{retreat from}} Kokoda in August and September was a trying {{time for the}} carriers, who were pushed to their limit, hauling {{supplies}} up to the front, and then carrying the wounded back. Not only <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> eight men to move each casualty, but they moved far more slowly, taking three times as long to traverse the track. It was intended {{that there would be}} separate carrier lines for supply and casualty evacuation, but this could not be adhered to. Each non-walking casualty meant three fewer bundles of supplies delivered per day for each carrier employed evacuating wounded. By 30 August, all the carriers had been drafted into evacuating the wounded except those reserved for carrying the 3-inch mortars. [...] The retreat and the sight of the wounded depressed the morale of the carriers, who repeatedly asked Kienzle why the Australians could not defeat the Japanese.|$|E

500|$|In its year end {{review of}} albums {{released}} in 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rebel Heart at number 45 noting: [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> this long for Madonna to write herself a theme song titled 'Unapologetic Bitch'? No apologies offered or needed—Rebel Heart was the queen's finest album in a decade, {{picking up the}} disco-stick baton of her 2005 Confessions on a Dance Floor as Madonna voyages back into the groove and reflects on where she's been lately". It was also listed at number six on its ranking of the 20 Best Pop Albums of 2015. Similarly, in its year end review, Spin magazine listed the album at number 21 as Andrew Unterberger noted that: [...] "For most artists who spent whole decades defining the mainstream, titling an album Rebel Heart would seem misguided at best, but for Madonna, it's truer now than ever: A fifty-something refusing to bend to public demands about how she should age gracefully... is as big an act of defiance as you can stage in contemporary pop music". AllMusic called Rebel Heart {{as one of their}} Favorite Pop Albums of 2015, describing it as: [...] "Bold, messy, and life-affirming record that finds Madonna simultaneously looking forward and back".|$|E
