Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care approvals were obtained prior to conducting this research. First, the proposed computational framework registered PET and CT images to provide spatial correspondences between images. Second, the lungs from the CT scans were segmented using an <b>interactive</b> <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> (IRG) segmentation algorithm with mathematical morphology operations to avoid false positive (FP) uptake in PET images. Finally, we segmented significant radiotracer uptake from the PET images in lung regions determined from CT and computed metabolic volumes of the significant uptake. All segmentation processes were compared with expert radiologists’ delineations (ground truths). Metabolic and gross volume of lesions were automatically computed with the segmentation processes using PET and CT images, and percentage changes in those volumes over time were calculated. (Continued on next page) (Continued from previous page) Standardized uptake value (SUV) analysis from PET images was conducted as a complementary quantitative metric for disease severity assessment. Thus, severity and extent of pulmonary lesions were examined through both PET and CT images using the aforementioned quantification metrics outputted from the proposed framework.|$|E

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> {{algorithm}} [19] is based on predefined criteria for aggregating pixels or subregions into larger regions. The method first starts with “a set of” seeds and subsequently attaches adjacent pixels of a similar nature to the seeds (grayscale or a specific range of color) of the growing area; this method has {{a wide range of}} applicability in automatic image segmentation and calibration, especially in the medical field. Ogiela et al. [20] used a <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm for the automatic segmentation and calibration of the carotid artery bifurcation region. Rajkumar et al. [21] proposed an automated mammogram segmentation based on seed point recognition and an improved <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm. Cheng et al. [22] used image reconstruction to design a new <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm based on self-growth vector estimation regions. For other areas of an image, the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm has various applications. For satellite remote sensing images, Liu et al. [23] used an expanded maxima transformation to improve the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm and effectively detected the convective elements of geostationary satellite remote sensing images. To solve the problem of color aliasing and mixed colors in the contour color layer of a scanned topographic map, Liu et al. [24] proposed a contour-line color layer separation algorithm based on a fuzzy clustering and <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm. To address the issue of the optical similarity of adjacent grains or optical aggregates in the precise imaging of minerals in weathered sandstones, which makes grain boundaries difficult to define, Asmussen et al. [25] proposed a seeded <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm that analyzes 39 transmitted light images of 13 weathered sandstone samples from the Buntsandstein Formation in northwestern Germany. In summary, the <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithm has been successfully applied in image segmentation and calibration, but the application of this algorithm in the segmentation of ancient murals has not been reported. As a special type of image, murals in the contours of an exfoliated area are clearly segmented from other normal areas. Applications using <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> algorithms to demarcate the exfoliation of ancient murals are highly applicable.|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of a <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> technique for segmenting prostate, bladder and rectum in CT images of prostate cancer patients.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for hierarchical image segmentation (referred to as HSEG) and its recursive formulation (referred to as RHSEG). The HSEG algorithm is {{a hybrid of}} <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> and constrained spectral clustering that produces a hierarchical set of image segmentations based on detected convergence points. In the main, HSEG employs the hierarchical stepwise optimization (HS WO) approach to <b>region</b> <b>growing,</b> which seeks to produce segmentations that are more optimized than those produced by more classic approaches to <b>region</b> <b>growing.</b> In addition, HSEG optionally interjects between HSWO <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> iterations merges between spatially non-adjacent regions (i. e., spectrally based merging or clustering) constrained by a threshold derived from the previous HSWO <b>region</b> <b>growing</b> iteration.

To counteract this, a computationally efficient recursive, divide-and-conquer, implementation of HSEG (RHSEG) has been devised and is described herein.

Implementations for single processor and for multiple processor computer systems are described.
