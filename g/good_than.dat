5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversial}} TV show {{he directed}} in 1960 gained him notoriety: The Sacco-Vanzetti Story on NBC. According to The New York Times, the drama drew flack {{from the state}} of Massachusetts (where Sacco and Vanzetti were tried and executed) because it was thought to postulate that the condemned murderers were, in fact, wholly innocent. However, the resulting controversy actually did Lumet more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> harm, sending several prestigious film assignments his way.|$|E

5000|$|This theory {{provides}} a convenient {{account of the}} difference between less developed (so called [...] "primitive") consumption economies, in which there are fewer <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> characteristics, and more developed ("sophisticated") consumption economies, in which there are more <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> characteristics, so that consumers can secure any combination of characteristics they desire, subject only to budget constraints. It also {{provides a}} way of predicting demand for new commodities, so long as they do not embody any new characteristics.|$|R
25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If I am out of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. Mother will {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put out more money on me, which would do no more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> it did in high school.|$|E
25|$|Manu (Frank Welker) - A mischievous baby baboon, who is {{fascinated with}} humans, and, {{when no one}} is looking, he is irresistibly drawn to rummaging through their {{belongings}} and trying on their clothes. He may even run off with a shiny keepsake or two. Like an inquisitive child, he leaves a mess behind, which means a red-faced Tarzan and the other family members are usually stuck with cleaning up after him. His mischief, however, sometimes ends up doing more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> first assumed, especially where the villainous Samuel Philander was concerned.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{collective}} action shows that public goods are still produced when one individual benefits {{more from the}} public <b>good</b> <b>than</b> it costs him to produce it; examples include benefits from individual use, intrinsic motivation to produce, and business models based on selling complement goods. A group that contains such individuals is called a privileged group. A historical example could be a downtown entrepreneur who erects a street light {{in front of his}} shop to attract customers; even though there are positive external benefits to neighboring nonpaying businesses, the added customers to the paying shop provide enough revenue to cover the costs of the street light.|$|E

25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less <b>good</b> <b>than</b> giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E
25|$|It's in this Sahih Hadith that Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi {{emphasizes}} that good innovative actions is strongly encouraged {{for as long}} as it doesn't goes against the Sharia (Islamic Law). What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person's hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It's encouraging for both. He says these is the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till End of Time.|$|E
25|$|Politicizing Science: The Alchemy of Policymaking {{is a book}} by the George C. Marshall Institute, {{edited by}} Michael Gough. The book, {{published}} in 2003, encourages a disinterested objectivity {{on the part of}} scientists and policymakers: Ideally, the scientists or analysts who generate estimates of harm that may result from a risk would consider all the relevant facts and alternative interpretations of the data, and remain skeptical about tentative conclusions. Ideally, too, the agency officials and politicians, who have to enact a regulatory program, would consider its costs and benefits, ensure that it will do more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> harm, and remain open to options to stop or change the regulation in situations where the underlying science is tentative.|$|E
40|$|We {{conduct a}} survey with 264 {{participants}} {{to test for}} relative consumption effects of national and local public goods as well as private goods. In contrast to previous results, we find that relative consumption effects are more pronounced for private <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for public <b>goods.</b> Our second finding is that relative consumption effects are less pronounced for local public <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for national public goods. We discuss and test different explanations for a good’s degree of positionality and find that these can, in part, account for our results very well...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how the electronic {{word of mouth}} (eWOM) information direction (positive vs. negative) and a website's reputation (established vs. unestablished) contribute to the eWOM effect. The article describes a study focusing on the moderating role of the product type (search vs. experience). The results of the experiment show that the eWOM effect is greater for negative eWOM than for positive eWOM, greater for established websites than for unestablished websites, and greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> The results support the moderating effects of product type on the eWOM information direction-website reputation-eWOM effect relationship. The impact of negative eWOM on the eWOM effect is greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> Similarly, the impact of website reputation on the eWOM effect is greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> The findings provide managerial implications for an Internet marketing strategy.

25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public <b>good</b> <b>than</b> others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E
500|$|The {{track was}} {{generally}} well received by music critics. Chuck Taylor, {{a columnist for}} Billboard, called the single [...] "entirely satisfying" [...] and appreciated it for being unlike other songs on the radio. Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman enjoyed the recording's seductiveness and its overall production. Toure from Rolling Stone was more mixed in his review, stating that it [...] "sound like [...] refugee from Diamonds and Pearls, the least-great of Prince's great records". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club agreed: [...] " [...] is more Diamonds and Pearls <b>good</b> <b>than</b> Sign O' the Times great." ...|$|E

He dismisses these issues as less important than freedom of speech. Godwin argues that individuals maintain latitude when communicating over the Internet because [...] "it's far more likely that they'll do <b>good</b> <b>than</b> otherwise. This is because freedom of speech is itself a good. The framers of the Constitution were right to give it special protection, because societies in which people can speak freely are better off than societies in which they can't".|$|E
50|$|The Bureau of Immigration {{started as}} a {{division}} of the Bureau of Customs during the American regime in 1899. It was appropriate because ship travel and ship cargo were interlinked and hence, the office was at the Bureau of Customs. It seems that the government then, gave more importance on the entry of <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> monitoring of foreign nationals coming into the country. The government was more interested in generating customs duties from these <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> in the control and regulation of the arrival and stay of foreigners. The functions of immigration remained under the said bureau until 1937 when it was transferred as {{a division of the}} Bureau of Labor.|$|R

500|$|The Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed. According {{to a major}} Russian pollster, {{the only}} eras of the 20th century that Russians {{evaluate}} positively are those under Nicholas II, and under Khrushchev. A poll of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good—except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided. Subsequent polls, however, have found Brezhnev and Lenin the most popular Russian leaders of the century.

500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going to do me a lot more personal <b>good</b> <b>than</b> the movies ever have... The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo."

500|$|Satin {{was devastated}} by {{the decline of the}} Alliance, and engaged in unhappy bouts of public {{criticism}} and self-criticism. [...] "We would rather be <b>good</b> <b>than</b> do good", he told editor Kevin Kelly. [...] "We would rather be pure than mature. [...] We are the Beautiful Losers." [...] As time went on, though, the Alliance came to be regarded positively by many observers. [...] For example, author Corinne McLaughlin sees it {{as one of the first}} groups to offer an agenda for the new transformational politics.

500|$|In October 1942, Roosevelt toured England, {{visiting with}} American troops and {{inspecting}} British forces. Her visits drew enormous crowds and received almost unanimously favorable press in both England and America. In August 1943, she visited American {{troops in the}} South Pacific on a morale-building tour, of which Admiral William Halsey, Jr. later said, [...] "she alone accomplished more <b>good</b> <b>than</b> any other person, or any groups of civilians, who had passed through my area." [...] For her part, Roosevelt was left shaken and deeply depressed by seeing the war's carnage. A number of Congressional Republicans criticized her for using scarce wartime resources for her trip, prompting Franklin to suggest that she {{take a break from}} traveling.|$|E
500|$|The playwright {{strengthened}} {{the contrast between}} Jekyll and Hyde compared to Stevenson's original; Sullivan's Hyde was more explicitly evil, and his Jekyll more conventional. In Stevenson's novella Jekyll is socially isolated and neurotic, and his motives for experimenting with the potion are ambiguous. Sullivan's adaptation changed these elements of the character. His Jekyll is socially active and mentally healthy, and his motives for creating the potion are benign; Sullivan's Jekyll tells Lanyon that his discovery will [...] "benefit the world". Later adaptations made further changes, representing Jekyll as noble, religious or involved in charitable work. Mansfield's portrayal of Jekyll is less stereotypically <b>good</b> <b>than</b> later versions, and he thought that making the characterizations too simplistic would hurt the play's dramatic quality.|$|E
