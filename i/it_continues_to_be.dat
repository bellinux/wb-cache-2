5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback.

5|$|The Freedom Press Bookshop is on Angel Alley, No.84b Whitechapel High Street, and was {{established}} in the 1880s by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson as the first publishing house to deal with anarchism and radical publications. The press has been controversial, and was fire-bombed in 2013, but quickly reopened. The Whitechapel Art Gallery on Whitechapel High Street opened in 1899. It was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in 1895 and was the first major art gallery in East London. It has shown works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and David Hockney. <b>It</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the centre of the arts scene in the area.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen {{as a threat to}} the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. <b>It</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> open to the public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a source of dispute.|$|E

5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. <b>It</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. <b>It</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
