5|$|On July 26, 1983, on the 61st {{anniversary of}} <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> {{of the three}} Baltic {{countries}} by the U.S. in 1922, President Ronald Reagan re-declared the United States' recognition of the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The declaration was read in the United Nations as well. Throughout the 51 years that followed the events of 1940, all U.S. official maps and publications that mentioned the Baltic states included a statement of U.S. non-recognition of Soviet occupation.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had granted full <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> to {{all three}} Baltic states by July 1922. The recognitions were granted during the shift from the Democratic {{administration}} of Woodrow Wilson to the Republican administration of Warren Harding. While the U.S. did not sponsor any meaningful political or economic initiatives in the region during the interwar period, and its administrations did not consider the states strategically important, it maintained normal diplomatic relations with the states.|$|E
5|$|Beadle's <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> of the post-UDI {{government}} in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister {{and others that}} he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E

50|$|Democratic Republic of Vietnam was diplomatically {{isolated}} by many Western states, {{and many}} other anti-communist states worldwide {{throughout most of the}} North's history, as these states only extended recognition to the anti-communist government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam however, was recognized by almost all Communist countries, such as the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, China, North Korea, and Cuba, and received aid from these nations. North Vietnam refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1957, perhaps reflecting Hanoi's deference to the Soviet line on the Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito, and North Vietnamese officials continued to be critical of Tito after relations were established. Several non-aligned countries also recognized North Vietnam, mostly, similar to India, according North Vietnam de facto rather than <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> (formal) <b>recognition.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bolsheviks {{could not}} prevent the {{independence}} of the Baltic states, but the West had to be persuaded to accept it. By 1921 Lithuania, and by 1922 Estonia and Latvia, all obtained <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> international <b>recognition.</b> All three states joined the League of Nations in 1921. The Baltic states begin to build a regional alliance system with their neighbours in Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In the south, Poland was reconstituted with consolidation of territories from Germany and Russia. Furthermore, in summer 1920, Lithuania cooperated with Bolsheviks trying to seize Vilnius, what poisoned Lithuanian relations with their neighbours. In the north, Finland had also been under Russian control from 1809 until its independence in 1918, but the Finns looked to Scandinavia rather than towards the Baltic states. In the west, Sweden followed a policy of neutrality, but during the 1920s it took a more active regional role.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Union {{voted in}} favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, which {{paved the way for the}} {{creation}} of the State of Israel. On 17 May 1948, on the third day of Israel's independence, the Soviet Union granted <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> to the State of Israel, becoming only the second country to recognise Israel (preceded only by the United States' de facto recognition) and the first country to grant Israel <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Refused {{entry into}} the League of Nations on December 16, 1920, Georgia gained <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> from the Allies on 27 January 1921. This, however, did not prevent the country from being {{attacked}} by Soviet Russia one month later.|$|E
25|$|Germany was {{the first}} state to {{establish}} diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union. Under the Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded the Soviet Union <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition,</b> and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.|$|E
25|$|On February 14, two {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses in Jefferson County, Timothy Love, Lawrence Ysunza, Maurice Blanchard, and Dominique James, {{asked to be}} allowed to intervene in the suit because their challenge to Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage within the state raises substantially the same arguments as the original suit. On February 27, 2014, before the final order was issued, the state attorney general asked Judge Heyburn to stay enforcement of his Bourke order for 90 days, noting that even if the state does not appeal the decision it needs time to implement it. Judge Heyburn issued a final order in Bourke on the same day ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions at once, which created <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> legalization of <b>recognition</b> of out-of-state same-sex marriages; being a final order it was then immediately subject to appeal. He then bifurcated the case and allowed the new plaintiffs to intervene and argue against Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to in-state {{same-sex couples}}. This portion of the case would remain in district court, retitled as Love v. Beshear. A briefing schedule on the in-state issue was completed by May 28. On February 28, 2014, Judge Heyburn issued a shorter, 21-day stay in Bourke, instead.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} the League of Nations' approach, the new state was diplomatically {{recognised}} by El Salvador (3 March 1934) and the Dominican Republic (1934), Costa Rica (23 September 1934), Italy (29 November 1937), Spain (2 December 1937), Germany (12 May 1938) and Hungary (9 January 1939). The Soviet Union extended de facto recognition on 23 March 1935, but explicitly noted that this did not mean <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) {{failed to}} achieve <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> as the {{continuation}} of the Socialist Federal Republic in the United Nations. It was separately recognised as a successor alongside Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. Before 2000, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia declined to re-apply for membership in the United Nations and the United Nations Secretariat allowed the mission from the SFRY to continue to operate and accredited representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the SFRY mission, continuing work in various United Nations organs.|$|E

40|$|A common view among nontheists {{combines}} the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objection that theism is epistemically unacceptable with agnosticism about {{the de facto}} objection that theism is false. Following Plantinga, we can call this a “proper” <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objection—a <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objection that {{does not depend on}} any de facto objection. In his Warranted Christian Belief, Plantinga has produced a general argument against all proper <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objections.

25|$|In 1924, as the Labour Party {{minority}} cabinet came to power, Ramsay MacDonald and Rakovsky negotiated <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> {{and agreed}} on possible future Anglo-Soviet treaty and a British loan for the Soviet Union. Negotiations were {{tested by the}} so-called Bankers' Memorandum, published by The Times, which demanded that the Soviet Union abandon nationalizations and return to private property. Eventually, two treaties were signed, allowing for commerce to be normalized between the two countries, and reflecting Rakovsky's views that private complaints of creditors against the Soviet state were to be settled outside the conference. The scandal which erupted when the Zinoviev Letter was publicized, rekindling suspicions against the Soviet government and provoking the fall of MacDonald's cabinet, brought an end to all further talks; {{during and after the}} incident, Rakovsky repeatedly cited evidence that the Letter was a forgery.|$|E
25|$|South African {{supporters}} of Theodor Herzl contacted Smuts in 1916. Smuts, {{who supported the}} Balfour Declaration, met and became friends with Chaim Weizmann, the future President of Israel, in London. In 1943 Weizmann wrote to Smuts, detailing a plan to develop Britain's African colonies {{to compete with the}} United States. During his service as Premier, Smuts personally fundraised for multiple Zionist organisations. His government granted de facto recognition to Israel on 24 May 1948 and <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> on 14 May 1949 (following the defeat of Smuts' United Party by the Reunited National Party in the 26 May 1948 General Election, 12 days after David Ben Gurion declared Jewish Statehood, the newly formed nation being given the name Israel). However, Smuts was deputy prime minister when the Hertzog government in 1937 passed the Aliens Act that was aimed at preventing Jewish immigration to South Africa. The act was seen as a response to growing anti-Semitic sentiments among Afrikaners.|$|E
500|$|Britain and Italy {{signed an}} {{agreement}} in April 1938. In exchange for <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> of Italy's Ethiopian conquest, Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian [...] "volunteers" [...] from the Nationalist (pro-Franco) side of the Spanish Civil War.

Later that month the new French Prime Minister, Édouard Daladier, came to London for talks with Chamberlain, and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia.|$|E

500|$|The General Division of the Rhodesian High Court {{ruled on}} 9 September 1966 that legal {{sovereignty}} lay with the British government, but that to [...] "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" [...] the Rhodesian {{government should be}} considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the de facto government by virtue of its [...] "effective control over the state's territory", but that <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> would be withheld as this was not [...] "firmly established". Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British Privy Council; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian High Court granted full <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> to the post-UDI {{government}} on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists {{who had been}} a month earlier convicted [...] of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that [...] "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".|$|E

40|$|Most {{discussions of}} Kripke's Naming and Necessity focus either on Kripke's {{so-called}} "historical theory of reference" or his thesis that names are rigid designators. But {{in response to}} problems of the rigidity thesis Kripke later points out that his thesis about proper names is a stronger one: proper names are <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid. This sets the agenda for my paper. Certain problems raised for Kripke's view show {{that the notion of}} <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity is in need of clarification. I will try to clarify the notion of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity by analyzing characterizations of it given in the literature. I will argue in particular that Kripke can count descriptive names as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid and that the concept of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity should not be explained with recourse to the concept of a semantical rule. The second part of the paper is a critical discussion of arguments intended to show that proper names are not <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid. I will show that these arguments are unconvincing by using Dummett's distinction between assertoric content and ingredient sense...|$|R
500|$|In February 1938 Hitler {{began to}} press the Austrian {{government}} to accept [...] "Anschluß" [...] or union between Germany and Austria. Chamberlain {{believed that it was}} essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo–Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria. Eden, however, believed Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition</b> of Italy's conquest of Ethiopia. Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy, or resign. The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain. Despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it, Eden resigned from office. In later years, Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement (Churchill described him in The Second World War as [...] "one strong young figure standing up against long, dismal, drawling tides of drift and surrender") but many ministers and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation. Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Eden's place.|$|E
2500|$|French Prime Minister and {{chairman}} of the Paris Peace Conference Georges Clemenceau commented that the Klaipėda Region was not attached to Lithuania because it had not yet received <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition.</b> The Lithuanians seized this statement and further campaigned for their rights in the region believing that once they received international recognition, the region should be theirs. As the mediation of the Polish–Lithuanian conflict over the Vilnius Region by the League of Nations was going nowhere, the Klaipėda Region became a major bargaining chip. Already in 1921, implicit [...] "Klaipėda-for-Vilnius" [...] offers were made. In March 1922, the British made a concrete and explicit offer: in exchange for recognition of Polish claims to Vilnius, Lithuania would receive <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition,</b> Klaipėda Region, and economic aid. The Lithuanians rejected the proposal as they were not ready to give up on Vilnius. After the rejection, the French and British attitudes turned against Lithuania and they now favored the free city solution (Freistaat like the Free City of Danzig). Thus the Lithuanians could wait for an unfavorable decision or they could seize the region and present a fait accompli.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{existing}} {{for only}} two years, the multiparty Azerbaijani Parliamentary republic and the coalition governments managed to achieve a number of measures on nation and state building, education, creation of an army, independent financial and economic systems, international recognition of the ADR as a de facto state pending <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>recognition,</b> official recognition and diplomatic relations {{with a number of}} states, preparing of a Constitution, equal rights for all, etc. [...] This laid an important foundation for the re-establishment of independence in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (<b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> legalities, possibly none of which is in force (de facto).

Ahmad, however, was in practice (de facto) the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead. [...] Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt ruled as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> viceroys of the Ottoman Empire, but acted as de facto independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, from about 1882, the rulers had only <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state.

5000|$|In April 1936, Dirksen {{finally made}} it to Changchun and {{concluded}} a Manchukuo-German trade agreement, which did not constitute <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> German <b>recognition</b> of Manchukuo, which the Reich continued to proclaim was still part of China, but did constitute a de facto recognition of Manchukuo. In May 1936, Dirksen objected to the visit to China of General Walther von Reichenau, complaining that the visit to China of a such well known German general on the active list and one known moreover as one of Hitler's favorite generals, would offend Japan. At the same time, Dirksen emerged as one the proponents of signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, which caused tensions with the Wehrmacht who were opposed to the pact, and with Neurath, not the least which was because the {{the plans for the}} Anti-Comintern Pact originated with Neurath's archenemy Joachim von Ribbentrop. In late 1937, Dirksen become involved in attempts to mediate the end of the Sino-Japanese war. On 3 November 1937, the Japanese Foreign Minister Kōki Hirota gave Dirksen a set of peace terms, which Dirksen sent to Neurath, who in his turn passed them along to Oskar Trautmann, the German ambassador in China, to be handed over to the Chinese. Dirksen took a very pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese line on the question of mediation, saying that if Germany had to choose between Japan and China, the choice should be the former rather than the latter. In a dispatch to the Wilhelmstrasse sent on 16 January 1938, Dirsken advised recalling the German military mission from China, ending arms sales to China, recognizing Manchukuo, and that all German investment in Kuomintang China be ended with German corporations henceforth to only invest in the part of northern China occupied by Japan. Noting that Ribbentrop was very pro-Japanese, Weinberg described Dirksen as the [...] "one important member of the German diplomatic corps who agreed with Ribbentrop's China policy" [...] and a man who did much to ensure that Germany finally recognize Manchukuo in 1938.|$|R
