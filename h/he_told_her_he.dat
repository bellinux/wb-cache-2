5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it}} was on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, Truth's son Peter {{took a job}} on a {{whaling ship}} called the Zone of Nantucket. From 1840 to 1841, she {{received}} three letters from him, though in his third letter <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never heard from him again.|$|E
25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she asked him how he knew Hebrew, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how <b>he</b> had set {{his heart}} on finding the king's daughter.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> {{lodged in}} a {{furnished}} hotel, and named {{the street and}} number.|$|R
60|$|In as {{few words}} as {{possible}} <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> where <b>he</b> had been, {{and what he}} had done.|$|R
25|$|On June 30, Cherilyn Lee, a {{nurse who}} had worked as Jackson's nutritionist, {{said that he had}} asked her in May to provide {{propofol}} to help him sleep, but she refused. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had been given the drug before for persistent insomnia, and that a doctor had said it was safe. Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
500|$|In January 1993, Tom Gosinski, an AVMT {{employee}} who had discovered her illegal drug use, was terminated on budgetary grounds. [...] Subsequently, he tipped off the Drug Enforcement Administration about her prior actions {{and a federal}} investigation ensued. McCain's defense team, led by John McCain's Keating Five lawyer John Dowd, secured {{an agreement with the}} U.S. Attorney's office for McCain, a first-time offender, which avoided charges while requiring her to pay financial restitution, enroll in a diversion program and do community service. Meanwhile, in early 1994, Gosinski filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against McCain, in which he alleged she ordered him to conceal [...] "improper acts" [...] and [...] "misrepresent facts in a judicial proceeding"; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> would settle for $250,000. [...] In response, Dowd characterized this request as blackmail, and requested Maricopa County attorney Rick Romley to investigate Gosinski for extortion. In the end, Gosinski's credibility was undermined by testimony in Romley's report from other charity staffers who asserted Gosinski privately vowed to blackmail McCain were he ever fired, and both Gosinski's lawsuit and the extortion investigation against him were dropped.|$|E
50|$|Shadow Stalker told Ellie, Ethan's wife {{about what}} happened. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> and his {{teammates}} will stop Ethan.|$|R

500|$|Pam and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are invited}} to Pam's former fiancé Roy Anderson's (David Denman) wedding, which takes place at 8am before work. They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what}} the secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
500|$|The {{week that}} Hauck {{was sentenced to}} prison, Cox was living in Nashville, Tennessee under the name Joseph Carter. He was dating a single mother, Amanda Gardner, who was unaware of his {{criminal}} past, and posing {{as the owner of}} a home restoration business. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was from a wealthy family, and his silver 2005 Infiniti and [...] "fashionably decorated bungalow" [...] seemed to confirm this. Cox used a falsified passport to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. He was reported by Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor. She became suspicious of Cox, so she researched him online, where she discovered his true identity. Taylor was put in contact with the attorney of Rebecca Hauck by a St. Petersburg Times reporter. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events. Cox and Gardner's home was burglarized, and they checked into a hotel. On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and credit history, but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson could give him a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months {{as a result of her}} assistance in Cox's capture.|$|E
2500|$|González's cousin Marisleysis said González {{told her}} the motor had broken on the boat and its {{passengers}} had {{tried in vain to}} bail out the water with nylon bags, but a storm doomed their efforts. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> tried to help get the water out and his mother's boyfriend placed him in an inner tube for safety. [...] "He said afterwards that he fell asleep and that when he woke up he never saw his mother again". He said, [...] "I think she drowned too because she didn't know how to swim".|$|E
60|$|And when <b>he</b> answered, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{recklessly}} that <b>he</b> had {{not been}} to see her because his best clothes were in pawn. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> had been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.|$|R
6000|$|His father said: [...] "No. Hasn't he come in yet?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how <b>he</b> {{had been}} looking everywhere, and she burst out crying.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>he</b> had heard, and {{the girl}} was {{conscious}} of mingled admiration and fear, the fear of losing him from her everyday life.|$|R
2500|$|Croatian sources {{stress that}} he {{referred}} to his Croatian identity. In writings to his sister Anica (Anna), <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had not forgotten the Croatian language. When he was in Vienna in 1757, he spotted Croatian soldiers going to the battlefields of the Seven Years' War and immediately rode out to see them, wishing them 'Godspeed' in Croatian. In {{a letter to his}} brother from 1757, he describes this encounter and remarks {{at the end of the}} letter: [...] "Eviva Haddick e i nostri Croati!", meaning [...] "Long live to Haddick and to our Croats!". While living in Paris and attending to a military parade where he saw a Croatian unit from Ragusa, his words were: [...] "there are, my brave Croats".|$|E
2500|$|Hill's {{murder trial}} began on February 15, 1971, before Judge Frederick Hooey. The case was prosecuted by McMaster and Ernst, while Hill was defended by Richard Haynes. Robinson Hill's friend and {{neighbor}} Vann Maxwell {{was the first}} witness to give evidence, and testified that Robinson Hill had said shortly before her death that she {{had given up on}} her marriage. Kurth testified against Hill, claiming that he had tried to kill her on June 30, 1969, by crashing their car into a bridge, and by injecting her with a hypodermic syringe. She also told the court that he had confessed to killing Robinson Hill. Kurth claimed to have seen three petri dishes in the bathroom of John Hill's apartment during the time Joan Robinson Hill became ill. [...] She said they had [...] "something red in them" [...] and when she asked Hill about it, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was conducting an experiment. Kurth testified that Hill was annoyed at her discovery and the next day, when she found some pastries in the apartment's refrigerator, he became annoyed again, telling her not to eat them.|$|E
2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> planned {{to drop out of}} Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zamora and his six castmates ( [...] , Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, , David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey, and Judd Winick) {{moved into}} the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, 1994. While the {{producers}} informed the other six housemates {{that they would be}} living with someone HIV-positive, they did not tell them who it was. The first to meet Zamora was Cory Murphy, who traveled to the house with Zamora. During their trip, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had AIDS. Zamora quickly bonded with his housemates. Zamora informed his roommate, Judd Winick, that he was the one with AIDS by telling him he was an AIDS educator, {{and the rest of the}} cast by showing them a scrapbook of his career as an AIDS educator. Another castmate, Rachel Campos, became uncomfortable with this, and initially distanced herself from Zamora, stating that she wanted to know how this would affect her, but said nothing for fear of seeming intolerant. Zamora took this as an act of rejection on her part, though the two later formed a rapport in the second episode, in which Zamora addressed her concerns about his condition by educating her about HIV and AIDS. Nonetheless, Zamora later took offense at jokes about homosexuals that Rachel engaged in with David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey.|$|E
