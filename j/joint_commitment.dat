Miliband made an unplanned visit to Lanarkshire to draw a contrast between a Labour and Conservative future for Scotland within the UK. A poll on 7 September showed a 2-point lead for the 'yes' campaign, leading to a <b>joint</b> <b>commitment</b> by Miliband, Cameron and Clegg for greater devolution to Scotland through a version of home rule.

We define such a fragment in terms of <b>joint</b> <b>commitments</b> of the interactants, and analyze how these commitments are made in a conversation. We distinguish between three layers of joint commitments: those that regulate the embedding activity of the conversation; those that constitute the joint meaning of communicative acts; and those that concern the target of the conversation. We argue that <b>joint</b> <b>commitments</b> are created in a concrete situation by producing and negotiating interpersonal affordances, which allows the interactants to retain suitable freedom of movement.

40|$|In this paper, it {{is argued}} that {{negotiation}} can be regarded as a socio-cognitive process for the transformation of <b>joint</b> <b>commitments</b> in multi-agent environments. To this end, a quantified multi-modal logical language is developed for reasoning about and representing agents' mental attitudes. Drawing on this language, negotiation is formalised using the classical axiomatic-deductive methodology for theory building. Assumptions are presented, and properties discussed on a proof-theoretic basis. The explanatory breadth of the formalism is illustrated by looking at its applicability in situations in which agents are boundedly rational, have asymmetric and incomplete information, are motivated by conflicting interests, and behave opportunistically...|$|R

In this {{paper we propose}} a performative theory of e-commerce, drawing on speech act theory, in which e-commerce exchanges are promises of future commercial actions, whose real-world meanings are constructed jointly and incrementally. We then define a computational model for this theory, called Posit Spaces, along with the syntax and semantics for an agent interaction protocol, the Posit Spaces Protocol or PSP. This protocol enables participants in a multi-agent commercial interaction to propose, accept, modify and revoke <b>joint</b> <b>commitments.</b> Our work integrates three strands of prior research: the theory of Tuple Spaces in distributed computation; formal dialogue games from argumentation theory; and the study of commitments in multi-agent systems...|$|R

5000|$|In [...] and {{subsequent}} articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7) Gilbert argues for {{an account of}} collective action according to which this rests on {{a special kind of}} interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a [...] "joint commitment". A <b>joint</b> <b>commitment</b> in Gilbert's sense {{is not a matter of}} a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says [...] "Shall we go for a walk?" [...] and the other says [...] "Yes, let's". Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a <b>joint</b> <b>commitment</b> account of collective action, in Gilbert's view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In [...] she discusses the pertinence of <b>joint</b> <b>commitment</b> to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.|$|E

We then consider the case of joint intention, where the goal in question in-volves the team performing some action. In both cases, the theory is formulated in a logical language of belief, action, and time previously used to characterize indi-vidual commitment and intention. An important con-sequence of the theory is the types of communication among the team members that it predicts will often be necessary...|$|R

Most importantly, a comparison of the sociocognitive capacities and motivations of humans and other primates indicates that humans might possess a unique adaptation for cultural interaction, transmission and learning.

40|$|Boshuizen, H. P. A. (2011, 30 August - 3 September). Development of {{positive}} and negative knowledge in a professional community. Presentation at EARLI 2011, Exeter, UK. This presentation analysed the question what the role is of negative knowledge (knowledge about what NOT to do, and about when NOT to do what) in further development of knowledge in a professional community. The case of Lyme disease, borreliose, is taken as an example. It was conjectured that professions differ in the amount of knowledge that is shared. Political or societal pressure may be needed toward more sharing. The present case shows that knowledge sharing (wanting to share; wanting to search for knowledge generated elsewhere) and <b>joint</b> <b>commitments</b> can make a huge difference {{but it is hard to}} say whether that applies in the same way to positive and negative knowledge … The issue of awareness of not-knowing and dealing with uncertainty transcends the positive/negative dichotomy, and is probably a stronger driver for knowledge development...|$|R
