40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{greenhouse}} {{study was}} conducted on four roadside plants (Festuca rubra, Lolium perenne, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens) {{to determine the effect}} of two <b>de-icing</b> <b>salts</b> {Sodium Chloride (NaCl) and calcium magnesium acetate, (CMA) } on their growth. Plants were grown in pots and supplied with solution of different concentrations of both the <b>de-icing</b> <b>salts.</b> Dry weight of shoot was determined by harvesting the plants after 45 days. Visual ranking of the plants showed that CMA is less harmful to plants than NaCl. At lower concentrations, CMA had no effect or even had favourable effect on the growth of plants. At higher concentrations, CMA decreased shoot biomass less than that caused by NaCl. Shoot weight of L. perenne, F. rubra and P. lanceolata watered by CMA was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than those watered by NaCl. In another experiment, these plants were sprayed with same concentrations of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salts</b> using tap water as control. After 45 days, the effect of spraying on plant foliage was assessed by visual observation comparing with control plants. Spray with CMA showed no harmful effect on plants while spraying with NaCl showed various level of injury and damage in all the species. It was observed that CMA is less harmful to roadside plants than NaCl. However, its large-scale use is not possible due to its higher price.

50|$|It was {{revealed}} on the 14th {{that all of}} the British county councils, London boroughs and unitary authorities were advised by the government to have six days' supplies of road salt in 2009. Up to 30 councils rejected last year's offer of thousands of tonnes of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> at a reduced price, to use on the roads this winter according to the BBC. The British Salt Director David Stephen made an offer out of the firm's 60,000 tonnes stockpile at Middlewich, Cheshire, in April 2009, but virtually no one to take up the offer. Evidence suggests that only a few took up the government's advice. The Highways Agency had 13 days worth of road salt, while Glasgow, Kirklees, Derbyshire, Derby City, Buckinghamshire, Cherwell District and the London Borough of Harrow took up the offer and raised their stock piles to seven days worth. The Cherwell Borough, Bicester Parish, Oxfordshire, Slough borough, Harrow, Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire, Fife, Brighton and Hove unitary authority, Liverpool city, Pembrokeshire, Lancashire, Belfast city and Perth and Kinross councils nearly to run out of salt. Scotland, Cumbria, Northumbria and Northern Ireland were getting priority access to salt due to the severity of the local landscape and storm activity.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium Nitrite has a {{great variety}} of uses. It can be use as {{antifreeze}} due to its high solubility, either in solution or powder. It can promote the hydration of minerals in cement using this antifreeze at sub freezing temperature, the operative temperature can be reduced to −20 °C. It also work as metal corrosion inhibitor, so it can protect steel in concrete buildings and structures from rust, to extend life of specific buildings. Nitrite's success as a corrosion inhibitor for the protection of embedded steel in reinforced concrete comes from the [...] "smart" [...] behavior of the AFm phase (AFm is shorthand for a family of hydrated calcium aluminate hydrate phases: aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent phases); normally it stores nitrite in preference to sulfate, carbonate, and hydroxyl ions so that the nitrite concentrations of pore fluid are low. However if chloride ingress occurs in service (from sea water or <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt),</b> the AFm undergoes ion exchange, gaining chloride and forming Friedel's salt (Cl-AFm), while releasing soluble nitrite ions to the pore fluid. As a result, the aqueous ratio of NO2−/Cl− increases which assures corrosion inhibition of embedded steel. [...] Also it is used as a heavy oil detergent and in pharmaceuticals, dyes and metallurgy industries.|$|E

5000|$|The {{premature}} failure of corroded steel reinforcements {{and the expansion}} of the iron corrosion products around the rebars are amongst the main causes of the concrete degradation. The carbon steel of rebars is protected from oxidation by atmospheric oxygen by the high pH of concrete interstitial water. Iron bar surface is passivated as long as the pH value is higher than 10.5. Fresh cement water has a pH of about 13.5 while evolved cement water pH ~ 12.5 is controlled by the dissolution of calcium hydroxide (portlandite). Carbon dioxide present in the air slowly diffuses through the concrete cover over the rebar and progressively reacts with the alkaline hydroxides (KOH, NaOH) and with calcium hydroxide leading to the carbonatation of the hydrated cement paste. As a result, the pH of the cement drops and when its value is below 10.5 - 9.5, steel surface is no longer passivated and starts to corrode. A sufficient thickness of concrete cover is thus required in order to slow down the carbonatation process towards the rebar. The minimum concrete cover will depend on the environmental conditions encountered and must be thicker when the concrete is also exposed to moisture and chloride (proximity to the sea, use of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> for bridges or roads, ...). A high quality concrete made with a low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio will have a lower porosity and will be less permeable to water and to the ingress of corrosive species (dissolved oxygen, chloride, ...). A thicker cover or a more compact concrete will also reduce the diffusion of CO2 in the concrete, protecting it better from carbonatation and maintaining a higher pH for a longer time period, increasing so the rebar service life.|$|E
40|$|Roads {{and traffic}} {{are a major}} non-point source of {{pollutants}} and may have severe impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. In cold climates, <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> is one such pollutant that may cause increased chloride concentrations and induce other effects on the environment. Monitoring and quantifying environmental effects are crucial for governing decisions towards more suitable use of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> {{in order to achieve}} and maintain good environmental status around roads. This thesis presents an operational modelling tool for monitoring the transport and fate of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> in the roadside environment in order to quantify changes in the environment at various spatial and temporal scales, using salt application data, meteorological data, geology and generic descriptions of hydrogeological environments as main inputs. A combination of modelling and various independent field measurements provided an efficient means for evaluating and describing the spread of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> from the road to the surroundings, the deposition of salt and ploughed snow in the roadside, and the corresponding increase in chloride concentration in soil and groundwater. Both the spatial and seasonal variation in soil chloride concentration were significantly affected by <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> application. The importance of type of soil, vegetation type, groundwater conditions and distance from the road was clearly demonstrated for modelling the transport and fate of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> in the roadside environment. Salt emissions from the road by surface runoff were estimated at 50 - 80 % of applied salt and transport by snow ploughing and air emissions at 20 - 50 %. The uncertainty in the spatial distribution of snow and salt deposition close to the road was high and a previous proposed exponential decline in salt deposition with distance from the road could not be justified within a couple of metres from the road. Future monitoring should include both modelling and systematic data collection {{in order to reduce the}} uncertainty in predictions of the environmental impact of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt.</b> Modelling of chloride concentration, soil water content and soil temperature and measurements of electrical resistivity may be a cost-effective solution for quantifying changes in the roadside environment.

One {{solution to this problem}} is to use low-shrinkage low-permeability high-performance concrete (HPC) for bridge decks exposed to <b>de-icing</b> <b>salts</b> and severe loading conditions. A new HPC was formulated to achieve low shrinkage and low permeability, high early-strength, and 28 -day compressive strength over 60 MPa (8, 700 psi).
