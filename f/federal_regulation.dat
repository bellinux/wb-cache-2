5|$|Lilly's {{greatest}} {{contributions to}} the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As {{a pioneer in the}} modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for <b>federal</b> <b>regulation</b> on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of <b>federal</b> <b>regulation</b> of the pharmaceutical industry, {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting {{in the creation of the}} Food and Drug Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} {{spent several}} weeks in August in debating {{the powers of}} Congress. Although Mason was successful {{in some of his}} proposals, such as placing the state militias under <b>federal</b> <b>regulation,</b> and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not be subject to amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.|$|E

25|$|Since the Court's actual holding {{concerning}} CWA regulation was narrow, {{while its}} rationale was wider ranging (as discussed above), the policy implications {{of how much}} the SWANCC decision restricts <b>federal</b> <b>regulation</b> depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied. Two scenarios are possible. A broad reading would be interpreted as knocking out all section 404 jurisdiction and Corps regulation of isolated waters and wetlands.
