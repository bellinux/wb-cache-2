5|$|While SUPP's {{candidate}} was confirmed {{only a few}} days after Hoi Chew's death, the DAP delayed announcing its candidate until 27 April. SUPP alleged the <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> due to a split in the DAP; however, the DAP insisted the <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> a calculated political strategy. On 27 April, the Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat announced Wong Ho Leng, state chairman of the DAP and State Assemblyman for Bukit Assek, as its candidate. Wong had earlier indicated his reluctance to stand in the by-election, suggesting that the party consider the opportunity to field a younger candidate.|$|E

5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.

5|$|On 26January 2010, nearly 14years later, the World Meteorological Organization {{announced}} that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide. This gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount Washington in the United States in April 1934. The long <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> {{partly due to the}} anemometer not being owned by the BoM, and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation. Despite the high winds, the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time.|$|E

40|$|Four pigeons {{were exposed}} to a token-based {{self-control}} procedure with stimulus lights serving as token reinforcers. Smaller-reinforcer choices produced one token immediately; larger-reinforcer choices produced three tokens following a delay. Each token could be exchanged for 2 -s access to food during a signaled exchange period each trial. The main variables of interest <b>were</b> the exchange <b>delays</b> (delays from the choice to the exchange stimulus) and the food delays (also timed from the choice), which were varied separately and together across blocks of sessions. When exchange delays and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter following smaller-reinforcer choices, strong preference for the smaller reinforcer was observed. When exchange delays and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options, strong preference for the larger reinforcer was observed. When food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options but exchange <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the larger reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal. When exchange <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options but food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the smaller reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays favored smaller-reinforcer choices. On the whole, the results were consistent with prior research on token-based self-control procedures in showing that choices are governed by reinforcer immediacy when exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>are</b> unequal and by reinforcer amount when exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>are</b> equal. Further, by decoupling the exchange delays from food delays, the results tentatively support a role for the exchange stimulus as a conditioned reinforcer...|$|R

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations.

Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game.

40|$|System delays {{considerably}} affect users' {{experience and}} performance. Research {{on the psychological}} effects of system delays has focused on delay length and variability. We introduce delay predictivity as a new factor profoundly affecting user performance. A system <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> predictive when its duration is informative {{about the nature of}} consecutive interaction events. We report an experiment (N= 122) where short <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> differently distributed across two alternative target stimuli in a choice response task. We manipulated variability and predictivity of delays. For one group of participants the <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> of constant duration. For three other groups the <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> variable, but differed in predictivity. They were either non-predictive, probabilistically predictive (they predicted the targets with a probability of 0. 8), or deterministically predictive. Performance with constant <b>delays</b> <b>was</b> superior to performance with variable non-predictive or with probabilistically predictive delays. Surprisingly, participants with deterministically predictive delays outperformed participants in all other groups. This has important implications for interface design, whenever there is some degree of freedom in scheduling system <b>delays.</b> Best performance <b>is</b> achieved with predictive delays, but only when deterministic predictivity can be achieved. Otherwise, constant <b>delays</b> <b>are</b> to be preferred over variable ones...|$|R

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E
