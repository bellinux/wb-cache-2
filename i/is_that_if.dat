However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E

The point we are making <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, {{but if the}} frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for}} the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the interest is retained by the lender {{from the outset}} of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E

50|$|War {{in modern}} times has been the {{inclusion}} of civilians and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying the enemy's ability to engage in war. The targeting of civilians developed from two distinct theories. The first theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> enough civilians <b>were</b> killed, factories could not function. The second theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> civilians <b>were</b> killed, the enemy would <b>be</b> so demoralized <b>that</b> it would have no ability to wage further war. However, UNICEF reports <b>that</b> civilian fatalities <b>are</b> down from 20 percent prior to 1900 AD to less than 5 percent of fatalities in the wars beginning in the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the pudús {{include the}} horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, {{and other small}} cats. The pudú is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a {{proficient}} climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15years and 9months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, {{from a wide range}} of causes. Maternal neglect of newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.|$|E

Many people had assumed, or at least argued they had assumed that the law since Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> book debts <b>were</b> paid into a separate account, then a charge over them would be deemed to be fixed.

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands {{and ask for a}} new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
