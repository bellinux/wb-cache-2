500|$|A January 1, 2011, a Newsweek article {{entitled}} [...] "The Manchurian Candidate" [...] featured {{an interview with}} Huntsman, in which he stated, [...] "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position.... But we won't do this forever, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have one final run left in our bones." [...] Asked specifically whether he intended {{to run for president}} in 2012, he declined to comment. The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dave Alizadeth from Las Vegas outlasted a {{field of}} 109 {{participants}} {{to become the first}} [...] "Dealers World Poker Championship". While other Dealer Tournaments had a reputation for sloppy play, the first Dealer Championship was noted for the seriousness with which the players approached the game. In the end, however, the winner was not determined by the deal of the cards, but by a deal at the table. According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because [...] "a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home." [...] Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to be a bracelet event. Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event. By contrast the final three contestants at the 2003 Championship were doing Kamikaze shots. [...] "We were all having such a great time," [...] the winner David Lukaszewski said, [...] "sitting around playing poker that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have forgotten about the prize money and the bracelet." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E

6000|$|... "You had {{something}} to do with the planning, too, Paolo. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> both feel well content with the rewards that we have obtained for two days' work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a bit daunted, though," [...] said Mr. Poyser, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> as <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have {{notice to}} quit, and belike {{be forced to}} take a farm twenty mile off." ...|$|R
2500|$|At a press conference, Hart defiantly stated, [...] "I {{said that}} I bend, but I don't break, and believe me, I'm not broken." [...] Hart {{identified}} the invasive media coverage, and its need to [...] "dissect" [...] him, as his reason for suspending his campaign, [...] "If someone's able {{to throw up}} a smokescreen and keep it up there long enough, you can't get your message across. You can't raise the money to finance a campaign; there's too much static, and you can't communicate....Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on. I refuse to submit {{my family and my}} friends and innocent people and myself to further rumors and gossip. It's simply an intolerable situation." [...] Hart paraphrased Thomas Jefferson and warned, [...] "I tremble for my country when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may,</b> in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve." [...] Hart later recalled, [...] "I watched journalists become animals, literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not know the facts. The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian government is going to demand... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> say with some assurance that they had expressed approval of those demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{in answer}} to mine of this morning. He {{is the best of}} the professionals, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> need his assistance. Now, Watson, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall know; {{but it is}} {{not well}} to explain to the others. Our enemies will find us <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> be forced to fight to the end, for they will not give up the chase until after many days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] remonstrated the rector, obediently {{taking his}} hat, [...] "whatever else <b>we</b> <b>may</b> doubt, <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> feel {{sure about the}} man's name! It is so remarkably ugly {{that it must be}} genuine. No sane human being would assume such a name as Ozias Midwinter." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{conclude}} {{that there is}} no technical impossibility in the Anarchist plan of free sharing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> trust him. Indeed I feel sure he won't desert his wounded comrade," [...] {{returned}} May, with a blush.|$|E
6000|$|But to {{understand}} a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement consists, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> reduce it all to these four sorts: ...|$|E
50|$|Phaedrus:I am {{fortunate}} in not having my sandals, {{and as you}} never have any, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> go along the brook and cool our feet in the water; {{this will be the}} easiest way, and at midday and in the summer is far from being unpleasant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Within {{the hour}} I will return here {{and explain to}} you and to the citizeness what I want you to do. We will get the aristos inside the Rat Mort, never fear; and after that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> safely leave Carrier to do the rest, what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Doctor Blimber, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> release {{this young}} gentleman from his books just now; the {{vacation}} being so very near at hand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{agreeable}} to that," [...] Harcutt said. [...] "From Densham's very elaborate provisoes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{gather that}} he has a plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> each {{go on in}} our several pursuits, each helping each, {{and each}} trying {{to do so without}} a foolish {{affectation}} of learning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, Selah,' Ronald {{went on in}} his quiet, matter-of-fact, {{unobtrusive}} manner, 'do you know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> fairly consider Ernest and Edie out {{of danger}} now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Bellamy, {{your stories}} are either true or untrue. If true, I should take no notice of them, because {{they must have}} {{happened}} before he loved me; if untrue, they would be a mere waste of breath, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> dispense with the stories--they would influence me {{no more than the}} hum of next summer's gnats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not think}} of revenge, or {{anything}} of the sort, at present. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> gain that {{by means of the}} law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be all}} right," [...] said Augusta. [...] "And now, mamma, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{leave them}} alone together." [...] But to this Lady Tringle would not give her assent. She had not had confided to her the depth of Mr. Traffick's wisdom, and {{declared}} herself opposed to any absolute overt love-making until Sir Thomas should have given his positive consent.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small {{is a man}} of his word. He {{does not}} flinch from his friend. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> very well trust him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have, we have! That is--yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> say, Marcelli, that we {{have often}} heard of him, and not unfavorably. Well, what of this Grimaldi?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I ask {{the three}} {{passengers}} to witness this bargain, {{if they will}} be so good,' said the voice. 'My boy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> safely get in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Sir James replied. [...] "You {{wanted to}} see my nephew, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and since <b>we</b> <b>may</b> talk about Stannard, I would like Mr. Deering to join us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And doubtless {{for once}} {{did not tell}} the truth. But, as she does not look more than twenty-five, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> all agree to let it stand at that, namely, twenty-seven, plus an {{indefinite}} period of sleep. At any rate, she is a sweet and most gracious woman, apparently in the bloom of youth, and, to cut it short, I fell in love with her." ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{looking at}} the matter in all its various aspects, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{reasonably}} conclude that little girls, when they play out of doors, are in more danger from horses, dogs, snakes, and bad company, than of being attacked by Eagles, and the children may all look upon {{the picture of the}} Eagle of the Alps and its baby prey without a shudder on their own account.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is of such ancient date, my lord--was of {{such short}} duration, and was {{connected}} with circumstances so exquisitely painful, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> dispense with renewing it." ...|$|E
60|$|But how {{was their}} conduct hypocritical? Stupid {{we might call}} it, or unreasonable: but how hypocritical? That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> see better, by {{considering}} what the word hypocrite means.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> fairly leave Kendricks {{to his own}} devices; and I'm not alarmed for Miss Gage either, though I do {{care for}} her a great deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} so myself, Wulf, though I {{would not say}} it; but in truth <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the risks <b>we</b> <b>may</b> run in making our way to Rouen are small compared to those of staying here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think,</b> Dick, <b>we</b> {{will make}} up our minds not to start until this evening. You know we had {{arranged}} to hire a vehicle, and that I should get a horse when I joined; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> now <b>we</b> <b>may</b> as well buy the horses at once, for of course you will be mounted, too. We might {{pay a little more}} for them, but we should save the expense of the carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wail hath fallen in, {{the stair}} is blocked, {{and the fire}} still rages below. By Saint Paul! friends, we have fought a very honorable fight, and may say in all humbleness {{that we have done}} our devoir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> now go back to the Lady Tiphaine and say our orisons, for we have played our parts in this world, and it is time that we made ready for another." ...|$|R
