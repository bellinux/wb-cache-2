They both {{see it as}} a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E

Charlie gets jealous when she ignores him at lunch and makes {{arrangements}} to meet Richard after school to discuss time travel with him. When she tells him her secret, at first he thinks it is a joke. But, what she said about him and the world would come from someone who had knowledge about the future. Peggy has decided to break up with Charlie'; she {{is the only one who}} wants that.|$|E
25|$|Dido and Aeneas are {{accompanied}} by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>with</b> attendants carrying goods from the hunt and a picnic possibly taking place, and Dido and Aeneas are together within the activity. This is all stopped when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants {{to prepare for a}} return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress's elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the command of Jove that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods, but is heart-broken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes off-stage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy {{travels to}} Apokolips {{and decides to}} confront Darkseid to {{determine}} his involvement with what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his manifesting powers. Solomon tells {{him that he had}} been turned into a spirit collector by Darkseid, who plans to drain him of all his powers when the time comes. He is then sent back to Earth along with everyone else. Jimmy is later captured by Mary Marvel who intends to deliver him to Darkseid. Darkseid turns Jimmy's powers off and prepares to absorb them, but is attacked by Superman. As they battle, Mary Marvel fights and defeats Donna, Kyle, Forager, Black Canary, and Vixen. Darkseid reactivates Jimmy's power to cause him to emit kryptonite radiation to kill Superman. However, Ray Palmer sneaks inside Jimmy and destroys the circuitry that controls his powers before being overcome by its defenses. Jimmy transforms into a scaled giant and prepares to fight Darkseid. Darkseid fights Jimmy across Metropolis and is about to kill him when Ray Palmer emerges from Jimmy's head, having shut down the device inside Jimmy that was storing the essences of the New Gods. A Boom Tube then opens up and Orion, Darkseid's son, emerges. Orion clashes with Darkseid and kills him after ripping Darkseid's heart from his chest. Soon afterwards Jimmy returns home, where his relationship with Forager deteriorates.|$|E

[...] Realizing Kenneth might know what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the TGS auditions, Jenna floats towards him with the wind in her hair, and when Kenneth sees her he calls her [...] "Vampyr!". Later, Jenna reveals to Liz that she has been brought into auditions, similar to what Liz and Pete are doing with rigging the TGS auditions, to make actress Kim Cattrall seem grounded and human.|$|E
500|$|Callaway {{carefully}} chose actors when casting each role. He {{focused on}} maintaining the series as a [...] "character-driven plot", to always make [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> people's hearts and minds" [...] {{more important than}} special effects. Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later {{say that he had}} difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on The X-Files. The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Jon Ehrlich composed the show's theme.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the hell <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E

Hestia is head-over-heals for Bell — who of course could never even fathom the idea of a goddess being in love with him. But while quick to anger and jealous to a fault, she is willing to put her money where her mouth is when it comes to supporting Bell — even if that means debasing herself to the point of taking part-time jobs. Through her, we also get a peek into the society of gods and why they are willing to sponsor heroes — bragging rights, mainly." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} its unveiling, the {{painting}} received considerable press attention from photographers, cameramen, reporters, and art critics and lovers. The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent [...] described it as [...] "catastrophic", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping [...] "can he draw?" [...] He noted that he believes in his work, and understands {{that there would be}} different points of view. Some critics believed that the shading below her eyes and her jawline aged her. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as [...] "disappointing", saying that it was [...] "pretty ordinary... He made her look older than she is and her eyes don't sparkle {{in the way that they}} do and there's something rather dour about the face." [...] Robin Simon of the Daily Mail described it as [...] "rotten" [...] and said it is fortunate that Catherine looks nothing like it in real life. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, [...] "The first thing that strikes you about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, sucking in her fangs). And God knows what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek. The hair is dull and lifeless; the glimpse of earring simply lifts her to the status of Sloaney, rather than merely proletarian, undead." ...|$|E

6000|$|While, however, this leading {{love affair}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> a tranquillity quite {{inconsistent}} with the rules of romance, I cannot say that the under-plots are equally propitious.

I do not think the general has ever been able to retrieve the ground he lost, when he fell asleep during the captain's story.

"And I don't believe {{now that}} the {{hypothetical}} case brought any intolerable stress of conscience upon Miss Shirley, or that she fainted from any cause but exhaustion from the general ordeal.

Of course, the catastrophe gave the whole surface situation away, and I must say that those rather banal young people behaved very humanely about it.

Cornelia's shame failed to kill her; she woke the next morning with a self-loathing that seemed even greater than that of the night before, but it was actually less; and it yielded to the strong will which she brought to bear upon herself. She went to her work at the Synthesis as if nothing had happened, and she kept at it with a hard, mechanical faithfulness which she found the more possible, perhaps, because Charmian was not there, for some reason, and she had not her sympathy as well as her own weakness to manage.
