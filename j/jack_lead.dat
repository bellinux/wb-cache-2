25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets.

The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer <b>jack</b> <b>lead</b> hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop.
