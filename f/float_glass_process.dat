25|$|Float {{glass is}} {{a sheet of}} glass made by {{floating}} molten glass {{on a bed of}} molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process.</b> The <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process</b> is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, who pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of window <b>glass</b> is through <b>float</b> technique, which causes diffusion of tin into glass surface {{in contact with}} molten tin. Using Indus- 1 storage ring, angle dependent reflectivity of the top and the bottom surface of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> were measured in vacuum ultra violet / soft x-ray region. Remarkable differences in refractive index were observed between the two sides. Surface impurities {{on the top and}} bottom surface were quantified using grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence measurements. The higher optical density of the bottom side was attributed fractional enrichment of iron along with tin diffusion. Casting the molten soda lime glass on a molten tin bath produces window glass, popularly known as <b>float</b> <b>glass.</b> This <b>process</b> of fabrication leads to tin diffusion {{on the face of the}} glass in contact with molten tin.

50|$|Drawn Sheet {{glass was}} made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader {{straight}} up while a film of glass hardened {{just out of the}} vat - this is known as the Fourcault process. This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. <b>Float</b> <b>glass</b> replaced this <b>process.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{is related}} to a {{detailed}} study {{on the influence of}} the quality of solar cell texturing on the electrical performance after encapsulation. The effect of texturing on cells front side reflectance was studied for alkaline texturing on Cz wafer materials and processes, acidic textured Cz wafers as well as polished Cz wafers and correlated to the electrical characteristics after encapsulation. The electrical performance on module level was studied indoor at STC (standard test conditions) with varying incident light angles and outdoor during one year of outdoor exposure at a location in southern Germany. To consider for optical effects of glass surface on module performance solar glass with various deep surface texture resp. a flat surface (<b>float</b> <b>glass)</b> were <b>processed</b> and characterized. We show that the degree of texturing hence the front side cell reflection has a small influence on the electrical performance after encapsulation with no measurable incident light angle dependency. Furthermore do we show that even for various textured glasses the cell texturing has no effect on the module performance, neither at STC nor at varying incident light angles. The annual electrical yield study revealed even a better performance for the acidic textured cell modules if compared to the alkaline (hence well textured) cell modules...|$|R

The comparative evaluation of vacuum evaporated chromium thin film adhesion strength to <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> treated under different surface preparation methods was performed using scratch tests. Also, the influence of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> substrate heating for chromium thin film adhesion strength was investigated. Surface activation and contamination removal by O 2 plasma process and RCA- 1 surface preparation method revealed the best results, where surfaces were free of hydrophobic contaminants with low contact angles ranging from 4 ° to 8 °. For majority of <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> surface preparation methods the contact angles were observed slightly higher for the “tin side” as compared with “air side”.

5000|$|In 1952 {{he invented}} the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process,</b> in which molten glass was [...] "floated" [...] over a bath of molten tin and {{manipulated}} {{to achieve the}} required product thickness, and with his associate Kenneth Bickerstaff, spent seven years perfecting and patenting its commercially successful manufacture. American inventors had tried several times to achieve an improved and lower-cost process to replace the costly plate glass, but had not succeeded. His breakthrough enabled Pilkingtons to dominate the world market for high quality flat glass for many years. Starting in the early 1960s, all the world's leading flat glass manufacturers obtained licences to use the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process.</b> From technical director of Pilkingtons in 1955, he became deputy charman in 1971 and chairman from 1973 until he reached retirement age in 1985.

50|$|In 1938, the {{polished}} plate process was improved by Pilkington which incorporated a double grinding process {{to give an}} improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process,</b> the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process.</b> The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.|$|E

50|$|Tin is {{suitable}} for the <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process</b> {{because it has a}} high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is immiscible with molten glass. Tin, however, oxidises in a natural atmosphere to form tin dioxide (SnO2). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a positive pressure protective atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|Although the patents had expired by {{the early}} 1980s, Pilkington had {{licensed}} their use, and required the licensees to keep {{the details of the}} <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> <b>process</b> secret.
