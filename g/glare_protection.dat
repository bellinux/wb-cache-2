40|$|Within {{this paper}} an annual {{performance}} and daylight comfort analysis of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is discussed, evaluated and {{compared to a}} common façade solution. The daylight comfort analysis includes annual illuminance, glare evaluations, and further daylight factor calculation. Secondly, dynamic thermal simulations are performed. The energy consumption of the luminaries is considered {{as part of the}} thermal internal gains. Both, the heating and the cooling energy demands are investigated. Different solar cell types (such as multicrystalline cells and monocrystalline cells), integrated in a sandwich-glazing substrate, already existing on the market, are investigated. They are categorized as shading systems differentiating only in their shape, size and therefore transparency ratio. The efficiency per cell as well as their visual comfort performance is exemplarily evaluated for a typical office located in Freiburg, Germany. The impact of the PV area ratio (ratio of PV coverage to fenestration area) on the façade both on the thermal and on the visual comfort are investigated in this paper. The annual simulation results show that a façade with integrated photovoltaics has the potential to improve overall energy performance of buildings when com-pared with the reference system Venetian blind due to the significant electric yield benefits. The shape and the adopted technologies have also an impact on the visual contact to the ambient and on the energy generation.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{disadvantages}} of purely subjective methods in a technical evaluation of daylight and artificial light systems, the Bartenbach LichtLabor developed new test methods which can determine objectively and quantitatively the visual or psycho-physiological stress connected with VDU work [1], depending on different lighting conditions. Daylight and artificial lighting systems were tested with these methods and compared by using the performances achieved by the test subjects. Some highly significant differences in performance done under the individual lighting systems became apparent and demonstrated that the visual stress or the physical or physiological fatigue from an ergonomic viewpoint depends largely on the lighting conditions at the workplace. This holds true for daylight systems (<b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> re-directing lamellae, clear window as a control condition) as well as for purely artificial lighting systems where especially the choice of color temperature of the light and the used control gear (conventional or electronic) determine the resulting performance.

The relation of the new criterion to the general color rendering index R-a as applied for daylight transmitted through glazing is discussed and several solar control systems are assessed with respect to R-a and Raout-in. Both color rendering indices are based on an evaluation of the color rendering of eight moderately saturated test colors illuminated with the reference illuminant D 65 and the illuminant under consideration (e. g. the same illuminant transmitted through a spectrally selective solar-control glazing).

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} the type of glazing and glazed area in a façade depends on many factors. They include amongst other criteria: location, orientation, climatic condition, energetic efficiency, usage of the building, required user comfort, and the architectural concept. All requirements cannot be fulfilled at all times and priorities have to be set to find a compromise between occupant comfort, design objective, cost and energetic efficiency. An innovative glazing system combining daylighting, <b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> seasonal thermal control and clear view was developed [1] and patented by the authors. This design was developed using a novel ray tracing approach to obtain a strongly angular dependent transmission with a specific angular distribution. Taking advantage of the changing elevation of the sun between seasons, a seasonal variation is created by a strongly angular dependent transmittance. In this paper we present the mixed dimensionality approach used to achieve a very fast and accurate ray tracing of any lamellar structure that has a two dimensional profile. The originality of the presented Monte Carlo algorithm is the separation of intersection and interaction. Intersections are computed using only the two dimensions of the profile thereb...|$|E
40|$|In a World {{more and}} more {{concerned}} about carbon emissions, global warming, and sustainable design, the planned use of natural light in buildings and the design of good solar control façade has become an important strategy to improve energy efficiency by minimizing lighting, heating and cooling loads. Buildings account for almost 40 % of overall energy consumption. The majority of this demand {{is due to the}} energy needed to provide sufficient indoor comfort. In addition electricity is required for artificial lighting and equipments. But fortunately it has been shown by various projects that especially new buildings are able to become a neutral energy balance on an annual basis ("net-zero-energy buildings"). To produce the same amount of energy, using renewable energy sources, as it consumes during the entire year, significant reduction in energy consumption and the use of renewable or non-finite energy sources are required. As result building envelop becomes really importa nt as it provides the necessary area for the installation of the collectors. An example of a new multifunctional angle selective glazing PV façade is here presented. It combines in one-element four important tasks: solar protection, <b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> visual contact and integrated PV-system for electricity production. These four elements, as are completely integrated in the function of the façade, do not reduce the architectural goal of the glazed façade and the view from the interior to the exterior is guaranteed.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of different internal blind's coating on the operative room's temperature in an office space. Because of the large distribution in building construction of new systems for solar protection, <b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> daylighting and shading {{it is very important to}} evaluate correctly the impact of such systems on the building comfort and the influence on the human behaviour. During this research the author find that many building energy simulation programs (such as ESP-r, TRANSYS, DOE- 2, Ecotect) considered the Mean Radiant Temperature independent from the real emissivity of the internal surfaces rfaces and treat it as: where Fj is the view factor between the person (sensor) and a given surface j in the defined environment and Tj is the absolute temperature. This approximation is acceptable for normal construction with emissivity (Îµ) close to 1, but leads to considerable errors if low-emissivity paint or coatings are u sed in the constructions. Starting from the theory of the net radiation in a grey enclosure of Siegel and Howell, the author evaluates the MRT defining that the incoming flux and the radiated flux are the same (for a sensor defined as a single point with small dimension). For this reason three equations are defined by the author. This method is partially based on ESP-r calculation and partially on an analytical method that allows the correct evaluation of thermal radiant field induced by considering the presence of surfaces with low emittance (Îµ) coatings. The method can be used either 'stand-alone' for comparisons of different faÃ§ade variants or within building simulation programs. A standard single office has been considered. The simulation carried out, under summer and winter conditions with high solar gains, indicates that when an "absorptive blind" surface faces outward, the summer temperature can be reduced by about 1 K at a position close to the faÃ§ade by reducing the emissivity values o...|$|E
40|$|Shading fabrics {{have the}} ability to reduce {{daylight}} glare and provide privacy when needed. Recent studies have shown that glare indices such as DGP and its simplified version can be used to predict daylight glare through shades when the sun is not within the field of view. However, there are no comprehensive studies on glare sensation with the sun visible through the fabric â€“ a situation that happens in office buildings â€“ and therefore the applicability of glare indices for such conditions is uncertain. Shades with very low openness factors transmit only a small amount of direct sunlight due to their weave density; nevertheless, existing glare metrics may show intolerable conditions for these cases, while specific studies with human subjects are nearly non-existent. This paper presents an experimental study on daylight glare evaluation for the case of shading fabrics with the sun within the field of view. 41 human subjects (n= 41) were tested while performing specific office activities, with 14 shade products of different openness factors and visible transmittance values (direct and total light transmission characteristics). The measured variables and survey results were used to: (i) associate discomfort glare with measured and modeled parameters for these cases (ii) evaluate the robustness of existing glare indices for these cases (iii) examine recently suggested alternate (direct and total vertical illuminance) criteria for glare assessment through fabrics, extract discomfort thresholds and suggest a new related index and (iv) propose corrections in the DGP equation when the sun is visible through the shades, which could be generalized for other systems following a similar approach. Combining illuminance-based metrics and existing glare indices can result in a more realistic glare evaluation covering all cases with and without the sun through shading fabrics. The new results can be inversely used as thresholds for selecting optical properties of shades to ensure <b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> {{as well as for the}} development of glare-based shading controls. ...|$|E
30|$|Modern office {{buildings}} often have large glazed areas. Depending on the climate zone, {{incident solar radiation}} on fenestration can lead to high cooling demands during hot periods, although solar radiation can help reduce heating demands during cool periods. Previous {{studies have shown that}} {{a large proportion of the}} net energy demand of an office building is related to window heat loss and cooling demands induced by solar irradiance. Some experts [1] found that, even in what traditionally has been considered to be a heating-dominated climate, cooling demands dominate the net energy demand of an office building. Solar shading systems are vital to reduce the cooling demand of an office building and might also be necessary to reduce glare issues. In the tropics, glazed façade is also the cause of large solar heat gains inside buildings, and researchers [2] are focusing on reducing solar heat (infrared) transmittance and daylight (visible light) transmittance. It was also observed [3] that, in the case of double glazing units (DGU), the use of a solar control film is highly recommended to increase the separation between the sheet glasses. The energy gain was reduced by 55  % compared to the traditional DGU without solar control film. Fixed shading devices (e.g. vertical fins, diagonal fins and egg crate) are used to protect inner spaces from direct solar gain through openings, windows and large glazed surfaces to control air temperature and improve the illuminance level. The results [4] showed that the temperature in offices with shading devices was reduced to an acceptable level compared to offices without shading devices. The visual environment was improved by controlling the illuminance level, improving uniformity and eliminating glare. Other researchers [5] recommend accurately estimating the optical properties of the different types of dynamic shading devices (such as roller blinds and Venetian blinds) and including their effects in the glazing system analysis. The Venetian blind is an interesting solution because it blocks direct solar radiation, whilst enabling the transmission of diffuse radiation indoors. Further progress is inextricable linked to the dynamic control of sunlight and optimal control of solar heat gains, taking into account the variability in the solar radiation spectra incident on the building’s envelope and the variability in outdoor and indoor air temperature differences. Tuning control [6] of glazing’s transmittance dependence on the solar radiation wavelength is required to optimise daylighting with reference to people’s needs (their health and comfort) and energy (thermal and electrical load minimization). However, the energy-saving potential of regulating solar spectrum response properties is greater than that of regulating the long-wave thermal emission property in summer; the trend is reversed in winter [7]. By properly regulating the NIR spectrum transmission and reflection properties and the long-wave thermal emission property, the performance of ordinary glazing can be improved to approach the perfect window for summer or winter. An advanced fenestration system must combine the functions of daylighting regulation, <b>glare</b> <b>protection</b> and seasonal thermal control.|$|E
40|$|This thesis adresses {{the phase}} transformations of thin {{magnesium}} nickel films upon hydrogen absorption and desorption. The reactions were induced by {{hydrogen and oxygen}} containing gases. The films were evaporated onto glass substrates and were covered with a thin catalyst top layer, commonly palladium. This layer catalyses the gas phase reactions and protects the MgNi layer from oxidation. Upon hydrogen absorption the investigated metallic MgNi alloys show a reversible phase transformation to semiconducting hydrides (switchable mirrors). This leads to a transition from a reflecting to a transparent state. Therefore such film systems {{may be used for}} smart windows with a high contrast ratio between the two states and an effective <b>glare</b> <b>protection.</b> However, up to now the cycling stability of the layers is too low. To improve the cycling stability, first the switching mechanism and its dependence on film properties are explored. The characteristics and the kinetics of the transformation reactions were investigated by measurements of the transmittance and reflectances of the film system during the phase transitions. These measurements were compared with calculations assuming various transformation pathways. With these tools the characteristics of the phase transformations that is nucleation and growth could be examined. Using methods like REM, AES, optical spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and solid state NMR-spectroscopy the film systems were characterized in both states of the MgNi film, metallic and semiconducting. The transformation properties show a strong dependence on structural and interfacial properties of the film system. During absorption of hydrogen the specific interfacial properties lead to the effect that the nucleation of the hydride phases is surprisingly favoured at or near the substrate interface. Therefore the formation of an hydrogen impermeable hydride layer at the catalyst/MgNi interface is suppressed. This effect explains the good hydriding characteristics of the layers with high transmittance values in the semiconducting state, which is crucial for applications like smart windows. However, in detail the hydriding characteristics show a dependence on composition of the MgNi layers, which is mainly due to structural properties. In this respect, only layers within a defined compositonal region with an x-ray-amorphous structure may be completely hydrided. In contrast the dehydriding reaction in oxygen containing atmosphere follows the expected mechanism with nucleation of the metallic phase at the catalyst/MgNi-interface but commonly with slower kinetics. With the knowledge of these characteristics the mechanism of the degradation were investigated using the methods developed in the upper part. Degradation mechanisms are poisoning of the palladium-surface, diffusion of palladium in the magnesium-nickel layer as well as oxidation of the magnesium-nickel film. The film system was improved by inclusion of additional layers such as an platinum overlayer and an vanadium interlayer between the palladium and the magnesium-nickel layer. With this film system the poisoning of the catalyst surface as well as the diffusion of palladium in the active layer could be prevented whereas the oxidation of the magnesium-nickel layer could be reduced. The cycling stability was improved from about 20 cycles at the beginning to about 300 cycles with similar degradation levels. In conclusion this thesis provides basic findings to improve the layer system of switchable mirrors...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is {{daylight}} in buildings. More specifically, the thesis presents {{studies on the}} performance characteristics of venetian blinds used on the interior side of vertical windows. A particular emphasis is put on the daylighting properties of different blind types, {{and the performance of}} daylight redirecting blinds is compared to the performance of traditional white blinds. Three factors are highly important for daylight in buildings: the daylight source, the optical properties of the fenestration or daylighting system, and the characteristics of the architectural space that receives the daylight. Earlier works on daylighting systems in buildings have often documented the daylight levels and the daylight distribution within the space. With that approach {{it can be hard to}} pinpoint exactly why one daylighting system performs differently from another. For the work presented here it has been a goal to focus on the properties of the fenestration system itself, while operating under various daylight conditions that are relevant for high latitudes. Some assumptions have been made regarding the architectural space (sidelighted with an elevated daylight opening), but apart from this it has been sought to describe the system performance more or less independently from the architectural space. This approach can be compared to the approach that has been used in the field of electric lighting. There, luminaries are typically specified by performance characteristics that are not depending on the space in which they are to be applied. For electric luminaries, photometric properties such as luminous flux, light distribution and light output ratio are commonly used to describe the performance of the luminaire, and these values are independent of the space where the luminaire is to be used. In other words, in this thesis, the venetian blind system is treated more or less as a “daylight luminaire”. The main tool applied to analyse the photometric properties of the “daylight luminaire” is Monte Carlo forward ray tracing. The software TracePro is used extensively for this purpose. This software tool is tailor-made for analysing optical systems (including luminaries). Unfortunately, daylight sources are not available in TracePro. For this reason, a substantial effort was made in order to generate TracePro light sources that represent the light from ground, sky and sun. However, once these sources were established and validated, many positive features of the program could be utilised with good effect in order to quantify a variety of different photometric characteristics (e. g. transmittance, light distribution and luminance) of venetian blind systems. In order to analyse these characteristics in a systematic manner the fundamental geometrical properties of venetian blinds need to be understood and these properties have therefore been derived and described. A new evaluation method for daylight redirection systems is presented in this thesis. This method is based on quantification of performance metrics already applied for such systems combined with new performance indicators suggested on the basis of literature findings as well as own studies of venetian blind performance. The main goal of the new method is to provide a tool that can be used to indicate performance of a particular system with respect to 8 different important criteria that are determined by the properties of the daylighting system: (1) supply of daylight, (2) room darkening, (3) light distribution, (4) <b>glare</b> <b>protection,</b> (5) outward view, (6) privacy protection, (7) solar heat supply, and (8) overheating protection. Star diagrams are used to provide a graphical illustration of the performance of the systems, where each of the 8 star points represents one of the 8 performance criteria used to evaluate the system. The new evaluation method has been applied in order to compare the performance of traditional white blinds with that of daylight redirecting blinds. The results show that, when both blinds are operated in the semi-closed position, the performance is roughly the same for all of the performance criteria considered. However, when both blind types are operated in the open blind position, the daylight redirecting blind can perform better with respect to daylight supply and light distribution. The results presented in this thesis also show that these benefits can be obtained without worsening the performance with respect to the other criteria. The performance of blinds has been studied for daylight conditions that are representative for high latitudes. It has sometimes been argued that, due to the typical low sun conditions, especially during the winter months, daylight redirecting blinds are less suitable at high latitudes. However, results presented in this thesis show that daylight redirecting blinds can function very well under most sun conditions that are typical for high latitudes, provided that the spacing to width ratio is carefully selected.
