30|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the effects}} of elevated CO 2 on photosynthesis in PnET-Succession are fairly simplistic. In the model, elevated CO 2 increases internal CO 2 concentration (Ci) and reduces stomatal water loss, increasing water use efficiency with increasing CO 2. Elevated CO 2 also modestly increases shade tolerance (Kubiske and Pregitzer 1996), which has an interacting effect on FolN and FracFol, which are dynamic as a function of light stress in PnET-Succession v 3.1. We experimented with a direct link between CO 2 and FolN, but were unable to find a scientifically defensible algorithm to implement such an effect short of adding <b>full</b> N <b>cycling</b> to the model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power {{electronic}} devices always consume {{a lot of}} energy, and this energy is then converted into heat, so that the device temperature rises. It will not only affect the device performance in <b>full</b> <b>cycling,</b> but also may result in damage, if the problem of heat dissipation can not be solved. In this paper, we propose an energy cycle approach that can provide a full utilization of the reused energy from the expansion tank to distributed pump. The Power distribution analysis of the controlling cabinet is presented together with the component in power cabinet. With the capacity of power {{electronic devices}} and power levels increasing rapidly, the thermal performance of the cooling system can be improved and higher requirements can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Cycling of {{conventional}} generation units {{is an important}} source of operational flexibility in the electricity generation system. Cycling is changing the power output {{of conventional}} units by means of ramping and switching (starting up and shutting down). In the literature, a wide range of technical and cost-related cycling parameters can be found. Different studies allocate different cycling parameters to similar generation units. This paper assesses the impact of different cycling parameters allocated to a conventional generation portfolio. Both the technical limitations of power plants and all costs related to cycling are considered. The results presented in this paper follow from a unit commitment model, used for a case study based on the German 2013 system. The conventional generation portfolio has to deliver different residual load time series, corresponding to different levels of renewables penetration. The study shows, under the assumptions made, that although the dynamic limits of some units are reached, the limits of the conventional generation portfolio as a whole are not reached, even if stringent dynamic parameters are assigned to the generation portfolio and a highly variable residual load is imposed to the system. The study shows also the importance of including <b>full</b> <b>cycling</b> costs in the unit commitment scheduling. The cycling cost can be reduced by up to 40 % when fully taken into account. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automated demodulator calibration station. Many commercial demodulator boards have an inherent problem of DC offset due to their direct down conversion architecture. It is necessary to measure the DC offset and compensate for it when the demodulator is used in a system such as a digital phase array. The proposed automated calibration station uses a combination of COTS hardware and software, such as NI PXI- 1044 (PC) and LabVIEW programs, to digitally generate I and Q signals. The LabVIEW program cycles through phase shifts over a range of 00 to 3600. These signals are converted into analog outputs using NI PXI- 6704 (DAC). Subsequently, these converted analog signals are fed into the modulator, going through an upconversion modulation process with an RF output. This RF output is adjusted to meet RFIN specification of the quadrature demodulator board before feeding into the board to recover the I and Q control signals, which are sampled by the NI PXI- 5112 digitizer. After the <b>full</b> <b>cycling</b> of phase shifting by the modulator is completed, I and Q offsets are computed. This station has improvements over the existing manual calibration station, such as ease of use, shorter calibration time, accuracy and versatility for future modifications and improvements.

While recent work {{has focused on}} the monotonic moment-rotation response for shallow foundations, the cyclic response and the accumulation of rotation {{over the life of the}} turbine must also be addressed. This paper presents cyclic loading tests where approximately 10, 000 cycles, with different loading characteristics, were applied to a model shallow foundation (a caisson) in loose sand. On the basis of these tests, a framework for assessing the accumulated angular rotation because of cycling was developed. The settlement and cyclic stiffness response of the caisson were also assessed. It was found, not unexpectedly, that the accumulated settlement of the caisson increased with the number of cycles and cyclic amplitude. It was also found that a cyclic loading regime intermediate between one-way and <b>full</b> two-way <b>cycling</b> produced the largest rotations. The cyclic stiffness was relatively unaffected by the number of cycles.

The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) (dimensions D and E), an isometric hand-held dynamometer and Asworth scale were the measurement instruments used in the study.

A statistically significant improvement in both gross motor function (p = 0. 016) and muscle strength (p = 0. 039) was found without a statistically significant alteration of the muscle tone of the quadriceps and hip adductors of the participants (p = 0. 13 and p = 0. 33).

40|$|Complex metal hydrides, {{containing}} up to 18 wt% H 2, {{are attractive}} candidates for on-board hydrogen storage. However, only limited reversibility of H 2 desorption is achieved under mild conditions, {{especially in the}} absence of catalysts. Nanoconfining the materials in porous matrixes facilitates rehydrogenation, but still full reversibility has been rarely achieved. We reveal the factors that limit the reversibility using NaAlH 4 in a porous carbon matrix as a model system. Relatively large Al crystallites (> 100 nm) are formed after desorption, migrating out of the mesopores of the matrix. However, their formation does not fundamentally limit the reversibility, as these crystallites react with Na(H) and H 2 reforming nanoconfined NaAlH 4 under relatively mild conditions. We show {{for the first time that}} the main limiting factor for the decayed cycling capacity is the loss of active alkali metal species. Evaporation losses are minor, even when dehydrogenating at 325 °C in vacuum. Significant losses (30 – 40 %) occur upon the first hydrogen desorption run, and are attributed to the reaction of Na species with impurities in the carbon matrix. A one-time addition of extra Na compensates for this loss, leading to close to full reversibility (> 90 %) at 150 °C under 55 bar H 2 pressure. A similar effect is found when adding extra Li species to nanoconfined LiBH 4. For nanoconfined complex metal hydrides irreversible loss of the reactive alkali metal species due to reaction with impurities can act as a major loss mechanism. However, the one-time addition of extra alkali metal species is very effective in resolving this issue, leading to close to <b>full</b> <b>cycling</b> reversibility under relatively mild conditions even {{in the absence of}} catalysts...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} tropical cyclone ensemble data assimilation is that storm-scale observations {{tend to make}} analyses that are more asymmetric than the prior forecasts. Compromised structure and intensity, such as an increase of amplitude across the azimuthal Fourier spectrum, are a routine property of ensemble-based analyses, even with accurate position observations and frequent assimilation. Storm dynamics in subsequent forecasts evolve these states toward axisymmetry, creating difficulty in distinguishing between model-induced and actual storm asymmetries for predictability studies and forecasting. To address this issue, we propose here a novel algorithm using a storm-centered approach. The method is designed for use with existing ensemble filters {{with little or no}} modification, facilitating its adoption and maintenance. The algorithm consists of: (1) an analysis of the environment using conventional coordinates, (2) a storm-centered analysis using storm-relative coordinates, and (3) a merged analysis that combines the large-scale and storm-scale fields together at an updated storm location. The storm-centered method is evaluated for two sets of experiments: no-cycling tests of the update step for idealized, three-dimensional storms in radiative [...] convective equilibrium, and <b>full</b> <b>cycling</b> tests of data assimilation applied shallow-water model for a field of interacting vortices. In both cases results are compared against a control based on a conventional ensemble Kalman filter scheme. Results show that storm-relative assimilation yields vortices that are more symmetric and exhibit finer inner-core structure than for the control, with errors reduced by an order of magnitude as compared to a control with prior spread similar to the National Hurricane Center's 12 ~h mean track error in 12 ~h forecasts. Azimuthal Fourier error spectra exhibit much-reduced noise associated with data assimilation as compared to the conventional EnKF scheme. An assessment of the affect of the merge step on balance reveals a similar, balanced trend in free-surface height tendency between the storm-centered and conventional EnKF approaches, with storm-centered values more closely resembling the reference state...|$|E

Here, we show that cyclin D 2 can co-operate with Ha-Ras to impose a novel transformed state on rat embryo fibroblasts (REF). While clonal cyclin D 2 /Ha-Ras REF transformants exhibit a characteristic transformed phenotype in high serum, in low serum they arrest cell proliferation and display profound morphological and cytological changes indicating loss of control of cell mass and deregulation of the G 1 /S transition. Notably, in low serum, despite re-establishment of actin cables and arrest of proliferation, cell mass continues to increase, creating giant cells up to 10 x normal size. Also, during low-serum culture the cells make a very gradual but progressive entry into S phase, reaching a 2. 4 N DNA content after 6 days. PCNA is expressed and 2 N and 4 N cells are largely absent, and thus the cells undergo a novel S phase arrest. While transfer to low serum induced the retinoblastoma protein to enter its dephosphorylated state, and cyclin A, cyclin B and cdc 2 levels to decrease, all as normal, cyclin E, cdk 4, cdk 2 and the exogenous cyclin D 2 persisted at high levels. These results indicate that cyclin D 2 and Ha-Ras can transform cells when mitogenic signals from growth factors are provided.

However CMC showed the better performance in terms of cycle life of the electrode. Whatever the binder, cycle life decreases with increasing the active mass loading, which is attributed to both the precipitation of liquid electrolyte degradation products and to the loss of electrical contacts within the composite electrode and with the current collector {{as a consequence of the}} active particles volume variations.

It {{was found that}} by optimizing the microstructure, i. e., texture and morphology of the polysilicon layers, and by optimizing the post dielectric deposition anneal, very high-quality dielectric layers can be obtained. In this paper it is shown on simple capacitor structure level and full EEPROM device level that the electrical properties of interpoly dielectric layers can be improved tremendously by using deposited dielectric layers with additional rapid thermal anneal. Typical results are: a high charge-to-breakdown (QBD≈ 25 C/cm 2), low leakage currents and decreased charge trapping during constant current stress. An additional advantage is the low thermal budget, which is very attractive for embedded applications. However, results depend on the polysilicon preparation, dielectric type and RTP anneal environment.

40|$|B-cell chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) was believed to result from clonal accumulation of resting apoptosis-resistant malignant B lymphocytes. However, it became increasingly clear that CLL cells undergo, during their life, iterative cycles of re-activation and subsequent clonal expansion. Drugs interfering with CLL cell cycle entry would be greatly beneficial {{in the treatment of}} this disease. 1, 1 -Dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (metformin), the most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent, inexpensive and well tolerated, has recently received increased attention for its potential antitumor activity. We wondered whether metformin has apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity on leukemic cells derived from CLL patients. Metformin was administered in vitro either to quiescent cells or during CLL cell activation stimuli, provided by classical co-culturing with CD 40 L-expressing fibroblasts. At doses that were totally ineffective on normal lymphocytes, metformin induced apoptosis of quiescent CLL cells and inhibition of cell cycle entry when CLL were stimulated by CD 40 -CD 40 L ligation. This cytostatic effect was accompanied by decreased expression of survival- and proliferation-associated proteins, inhibition of signaling pathways involved in CLL disease progression and decreased intracellular glucose available for glycolysis. In drug combination experiments, metformin lowered the apoptotic threshold and potentiated the cytotoxic effects of classical and novel antitumor molecules.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. The North Wyke Farm Platform was {{established}} as a United Kingdom national capability for collaborative research, training and knowledge exchange in agro-environmental sciences. Its remit is to research agricultural productivity and ecosystem responses to different management practices for beef and sheep production in lowland grasslands. A system based on permanent pasture was implemented on three 21 -ha farmlets to obtain baseline data on hydrology, nutrient cycling and productivity for 2 [*]years. Since then two farmlets have been modified by either (i) planned reseeding with grasses that have been bred for enhanced sugar content or deep-rooting traits or (ii) sowing grass and legume mixtures to reduce nitrogen fertilizer inputs. The quantities of nutrients that enter, cycle within and leave the farmlets were evaluated with data recorded from sensor technologies coupled with more traditional field study methods. We demonstrate the potential of the farm platform approach with a case study in which we investigate the effects of the weather, field topography and farm management activity on surface runoff and associated pollutant or nutrient loss from soil. We have the opportunity to do a <b>full</b> nutrient <b>cycling</b> analysis, taking account of nutrient transformations in soil, and flows to water and losses to air. The NWFP monitoring system is unique in both scale and scope for a managed land-based capability that brings together several technologies that allow the effect of temperate grassland farming systems on soil moisture levels, runoff and associated water quality dynamics to be studied in detail.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a family of}} implementations of low order, additive, geometric multilevel solvers for systems of Helmholtz equations. Both grid spacing and arithmetics may comprise complex numbers and we thus can apply complex scaling techniques to the indefinite Helmholtz operator. Our implementations are based upon {{the notion of a}} spacetree and work exclusively with a finite number of precomputed local element matrices. They are globally matrix-free. Combining various relaxation factors with two grid transfer operators allows us to switch from pure additive multigrid over a hierarchical basis method into BPX with several multiscale smoothing variants within one code base. Pipelining allows us to realise a full approximation storage (FAS) scheme within the additive environment where, amortised, each grid vertex carrying degrees of freedom is read/written only once per iteration. The codes thus realise a single-touch policy. Among the features facilitated by matrix-free FAS is arbitrary dynamic mesh refinement (AMR) for all solver variants. AMR as enabler for <b>full</b> multigrid (FMG) <b>cycling</b> [...] -the grid unfolds throughout the computation [...] -allows us to reduce the cost per unknown per order of accuracy. The present paper primary contributes towards software realisation and design questions.

Since precipitation by nature has large variability and low predictability at cloud-resolving scales, the impact of precipitation data on the skills of mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) is largely affected by the characterization of background and observation errors and the representation of nonlinear cloud/precipitation physics in an NWP data assimilation system. We present a data impact study on the assimilation of precipitation-affected microwave (MW) radiances from a pre-GPM satellite constellation using the Goddard WRF Ensemble Data Assimilation System (Goddard WRF-EDAS). A series of assimilation experiments are carried out in a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model domain of 9 km resolution in western Europe. Sensitivities to observation error specifications, background error covariance estimated from ensemble forecasts with different ensemble sizes, and MW channel selections are examined through single-observation assimilation experiments. An empirical bias correction for precipitation-affected MW radiances is developed based on the statistics of radiance innovations in rainy areas. The data impact is assessed by <b>full</b> data assimilation <b>cycling</b> experiments for a storm event that occurred in France in September 2010.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered today the best technology for this application {{as demonstrated by the}} recent interest of automotive industry in hybrid (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV) based on LIBs. This thesis work, starting from the synthesis and characterization of electrode materials and the use of non-conventional electrolytes, demonstrates that LIBs with novel and safe electrolytes and electrode materials meet the targets of specific energy and power established by U. S. A. Department of Energy (DOE) for automotive application in HEV and EV. In chapter 2 is reported the origin of all chemicals used, the description of the instruments used for synthesis and chemical-physical characterizations, the electrodes preparation, the batteries configuration and the electrochemical characterization procedure of electrodes and batteries. Since the electrolyte is the main critical point of a battery, in particular in large- format modules, in chapter 3 we focused on the characterization of innovative and safe electrolytes based on ionic liquids (characterized by high boiling/decomposition points, thermal and electrochemical stability and appreciable conductivity) and mixtures of ionic liquid with conventional electrolyte. In chapter 4 is discussed the microwave accelerated sol–gel synthesis of the carbon- coated lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 -C), an excellent cathode material for LIBs thanks to its intrinsic safety and tolerance to abusive conditions, which showed excellent electrochemical performance in terms of speciﬁc capacity and stability. In chapter 5 are presented the chemical-physical and electrochemical characterizations of graphite and titanium-based anode materials in different electrolytes. We also characterized a new anodic material, amorphous SnCo alloy, synthetized with a nanowire morphology that showed to strongly enhance the electrochemical stability of the material during galvanostatic <b>full</b> charge/discharge <b>cycling.</b> Finally, in chapter 6, are reported different types of batteries, assembled using the LiFePO 4 -C cathode material, different anode materials and electrolytes, characterized by deep galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at different C-rates and by test procedures of the DOE protocol for evaluating pulse power capability and available energy. First, we tested a battery with the innovative cathode material LiFePO 4 -C and conventional graphite anode and carbonate-based electrolyte (EC DMC LiPF 6 1 M) that demonstrated to surpass easily the target for power-assist HEV application.

The Wingate test was performed at 9 % of body mass and for 30 seconds with a 5 second speed up period. The incremental test started at 100 W and increased in resistance by 50 W every 3 minutes until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate, VO 2, power output and blood lactate were measured during the maximal incremental test. Results: The results showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) for the Wingate test between the RB and EB both in terms of peak power output (POmax) and mean power output (POmean) with subjects generating greater power outputs on the EB. During the maximal incremental test, significant differences (p< 0. 01) were found between EB and RB for submaximal power output, heart rate, and VO 2 at both lactate threshold 1 (1 mmol. l- 1 rise above baseline, LT 1) and onset of blood lactate accumulation (4 mmol. l- 1 blood lactate reference point, OBLA), as well as peak power output at VO 2 max (PVO 2 max). Conclusions: Overall it was shown that significant differences in physiological demands were present between the two ergometers under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 61 - 72). Fossil fuels hold the biggest share in energy sources {{for a very}} long time, especially in transportation, because of their appealing properties like very high energy efficiency, easy transport to any place in the world, very straightforward usage principle and they used to be quite abundant. However fossil fuel consumption results into release of harmful greenhouse gasses that causes global warming. On the other hand fossil fuels are not very abundant anymore and as a product that is formed in millions of years, the increasing energy demand worsens the situation. That is why renewable energy sources are more and more pronounced each day in the last half century. Nonetheless, irregular nature of the renewable energy sources makes them highly unpractical. Energy can only be harvested from renewable energy sources in specific time or specific locations, for instance, {{it is not possible to}} harvest energy from sun all day long or wind turbines can only be efficient in the places that there is sufficient wind power. This being the case, a clever approach is needed in order to be able to benefit from such convenient energy sources. Energy storage systems are the saviour in this picture since they can be used to store the energy that is produced from renewable energy sources and available when needed. For instance, lithium oxygen (Li-O 2) batteries are a very promising candidates for a replacement of fossil fuels in transportation due to their very high theoretical gravimetric energy density. Oxygen is used as active cathode material unwanted side product formations on cathode-electrolyte interface. These side products are accumulating on the cathode surface upon battery cycling and result into drastic capacity fading. Especially carbon based materials are not stable against battery cycling in Li-O 2 batteries even tough they have quite profitable features as a cathode material for Li-O 2 batteries, such as; high surface area, low weight, high electrical conductivity, good oxygen reduction reaction activity etc. In this thesis study, the motivation is to increase the stability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) while benefiting from their aforementioned advantages in Li-O 2 batteries. In order to achieve this, an ultrathin and uniform titanium dioxide (TiO 2) layer is coated on CNT surface by atomic layer deposition method. Prior to TiO 2 coating an effective functionalization method is introduced to CNT surfaces to facilitate a uniform coating. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and x-ray diffractometer analysis are performed to observe coating properties. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and scanning electron microscopy imaging show the subsided side reactions, proving the stability of the TiO 2 coated CNT cathode.
