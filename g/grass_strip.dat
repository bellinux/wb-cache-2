5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a <b>grass</b> <b>strip.</b> It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} approach, the plane descended along the ILS {{glideslope}} until at about 700ft, the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, {{the rate of}} descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the <b>grass</b> <b>strip</b> next to the runway.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{assessed}} {{the benefits of}} sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> on grasshopper communities in intensive farmland, {{and the effects of}} farming practices and landscape context. Results showed that sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> were high quality habitats for grasshoppers compared to grasslands. Farming practices influenced grasshopper densities in sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> while landscape context affected more the species richness of grasshoppers. Sown mixture and cutting export option were the main factors driving grasshopper density. Mixtures composed of grasses without legumes were the best, as well as hay export compared to no export. Increased grasshopper species richness occurred in sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> located in landscapes with low grassland field availability and high connectivity. Enhanced use of sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> by grasshoppers {{can be seen as a}} direct effect of establishment and management options, but also as an effect of the rarity and instability of other grassland habitats in agricultural landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Since 2005, French farmers must set up sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> along {{rivers in}} order to {{decrease}} pesticide levels and soil erosion. Farmers have thus parcelled out their fields, set aside 3 % of their farm size and managed grass without herbicide. Consequently, this environmental policy may cause farmers’ fears due to economic losses and weed infestations of their field margins. Here, we studied farmers’ perception of sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> First, we interviewed 29 farmers in two French regions. Second, we evaluated the economic loss of gross margin when replacing crop by grass. Third, we evaluated the weed risk using flora surveys in sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> Our results showed that two thirds of interviewed farmers thought that sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> affected their farm revenue and represented a weed risk. Concerning economy, we found that farmers loose from 358 to 853 €/ha the year of installation and from 126 to 641 €/ha next years. This economic loss is mainly due {{to the loss of}} crop production, with a minor impact of grass management cost. At the farm level, 3 % of sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> decreased the farm revenue by 7 %. Concerning the weed risk, the farmers’ perception was linked with the presence of some competitive perennial weeds, e. g. Cirsium arvense, and wind-dispersing weeds, e. g. Asteraceae. Sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> with high weed species richness of 26 species on average, or with dominance of non-sown species (16. 7 % of sown <b>grass</b> <b>strips)</b> did not affect the farmers’ perception.

500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a <b>grass</b> <b>strip</b> littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grass</b> buffer <b>strips</b> {{impact the}} {{hydrology}} of flow and consequently {{the fate of}} sediment. A complex process-based model is developed to predict flow characteristics as well as sediment deposition and transport upstream, and within <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> The model is capable of estimating the proportion and amount of different sediment particle size classes in the outflow. The modified Green–Ampt equation was used to simulate infiltration. Gradually varied flow and kinematic wave approximation were used to model flow characteristics upstream and within <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> The GUEST model approach has been modified {{in order to use}} its basic approaches in sediment transport module in <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> Model predictions agree well with the results of two sets of controlled experiments. The bias, coefficient of model efficiency and the root mean squared error of the modelled efficiency of <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> in reducing sediment concentration were 0. 93 – 0. 99, 0. 58 – 0. 99 and 8. 9 – 12. 7, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the initial soil moisture and flow rate are the most sensitive parameters in predicting runoff loss. Increasing the slope steepness and flow rate dramatically decreases the efficiency of <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> in reducing sediment concentration and mass. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|In the {{semiarid}} {{regions of}} sub-Saharan Africa, fertilizer recovery and nutrient release from organic sources are often moisture limited. Moreover, {{in these regions}} runoff brings about large nutrient losses from fertilizer or organic inputs. This {{study was conducted in}} the north sudanian climate zone of Burkina Faso (annual rainfall 800 mm, PET 2000 mm yr- 1). We assessed the combined and interactive effects of two types of permeable barriers (stone rows and <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> of Andropogon gayanus Kunth cv. Bisquamulatus (Hochst.) Hack.) and organic or mineral sources of nitrogen on erosion control and sorghum yield. The field experiment (Ferric Lixisol, 1. 5 % slope) was carried out during three rainy seasons and consisted of 2 replications of 9 treatments, in which the barriers were put along contours and combined with compost, manure and fertilizer nitrogen (N). Compared with the control plots, the average reduction in runoff was 59 % in plots with barriers alone, but reached 67 % in plots with barriers + mineral N and 84 % in plots with barriers + organic N. On average, stone rows reduced soil erosion more than <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> (66 % versus 51 %). Stone rows or <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> without N input did not induce a significant increase of sorghum production. Supplying compost or manure in combination with stone rows or <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> increased sorghum grain yield by about 142 %, compared with a 65 % increase due to mineral fertilizers. The sorghum grain yields at 1 m upslope from the <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> were less than those 17 m from the <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> As stones do not compete with plants, the opposite trend was observed with stone rows. We conclude that for these nutrient depleted soils, permeable barriers improve nutrient use efficiency and therefore crop production. However, <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> must be managed to alleviate shade and other negative effects of the bunds on adjacent crops...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>strips</b> {{are known}} as one of the most {{effective}} management practices in controlling sediment loss to rivers and other surface water bodies. Some physically-based models have been previously developed to predict the amount of sediment retention in <b>grass</b> <b>strips.</b> Although physically-based models can explain the effects and interactions of various factors, they tend to be sophisticated as they require a large amount of input data. A nonparametric supervised learning statistical model was developed to predict the efficiency of <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> in trapping sediments. Grass type and density, inflow sediment particle size distribution, slope steepness, length of strip, and the antecedent soil moisture were the five major factors on which the statistical model was built. The model was assessed by comparing with an independent dataset. Estimated bias, coefficient of model efficiency, mean absolute percentage error, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of the model were 1. 01, 0. 54, 18. 1 and 76 % respectively. Testing the model predictions, permuting the input data, showed that inflow sediment particle size distribution, length of the buffer strip, and the antecedent soil moisture are the most important factors upon the performance of <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> in trapping sediments. From the model outputs for a range of likely scenarios it was concluded that very long strips are needed in extreme conditions such as steep slopes, wet soil and sparse <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> in order to trap sediments effectively.

40|$|Nutrient {{limitation}} {{is the main}} cause of per capita decline in crop production in the Sahel, where water shortage also limits an efficient use of available nutrients. Combining soil and water conservation measures with locally available nutrient inputs may optimize crop production and economic benefit in cereal-based farming systems. A study conducted in 2001 and 2002 at Saria, Burkina Faso (annual rainfall 800 mm, PET of 2000 mm yr– 1) assessed the combined effects of two types of semi-permeable barriers (stone rows and <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> of Andropogon gayanus Kunth cv. Bisquamulatus (Hochst.) Hack.) and the application of compost or urea on sorghum performance and economic benefits. The field experiment was carried out on a Ferric Lixisol, 1. 5 % slope and comprised 9 treatments in which the barriers were put along contours and combined with compost-N or urea-N. Installation of stone rows or <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> without addition of nutrient inputs was not cost effective, although it induced sorghum yield increase (12 – 58 %) particularly under poor rainfall conditions. Combining compost with stone rows or <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> significantly increased sorghum yield that induced positive interaction effects (mean added effects of 185 kg ha– 1 for stone rows combined with compost-N and 300 kg ha– 1 for <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> combined with compost-N). Economic benefits were substantial (109 480 to 138 180 FCFA ha– 1) when compost-N was added to both stone rows and <b>grass</b> <b>strips,</b> whereas limited economic benefits were observed with the application of urea-N (1120 to 22 120 FCFA ha– 1).

In {{the context of the}} new EU policy for the {{protection}} of water resources, vineyard area will account as one of the major contributor to water contamination. <b>Grass</b> buffer <b>strips</b> have recently been developed as a solution for reducing pesticide transfer by surface runoff from vineyard parcels to adjacent streams. Although pesticide interception by <b>grass</b> <b>strips</b> has generally been proven effective, {{little is known about the}} fate of intercepted pesticides. In order to tackle this question we worked since several years at the scale of a small watershed located in the Beaujolais vineyard (France). The ability of the soil microflora to degrade diuron, an herbicide belonging to phenyl-urea family, was addressed by radiorespirometric analyses showing that the <b>grass</b> buffer <b>strip</b> could develop efficient degrading ability if regularly exposed to the contaminant 1. Interestingly, we revealed the presence of bacterial populations able to rapidly mineralize this herbicide in the <b>grass</b> buffer <b>strips.</b> We also showed that their genetic potential (puhA and puhB genes) could be transferred by erosion to the sediment of the river adjacent to the <b>grass</b> buffer <b>strip</b> 2. With the aim to promote natural attenuation of pesticides in the <b>grass</b> buffer <b>strip,</b> bioaugmentation experiments with diuron-degrading bacterial populations are ongoing. All these data seem to indicate that the development of a second generation of engineered <b>grass</b> buffer <b>strip</b> acting as an ‘in field bioreactor’ favoring pesticide biodegradation could represent an interesting tool to protect water resources in the vineyard area...|$|R

Cumulative results for four consecutive seasons showed that most successful treatment H + M reduced soil loss from just over 100 to only 2 Mg ha- 1 (or t ha- 1) and runoff from just below 100 to 20 mm as compared to the sole crop control C. <b>Grass</b> <b>strips</b> were less effective (15 Mg ha- 1 and 46 mm, respectively).
