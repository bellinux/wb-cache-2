500|$|The same profile quoted Morell's catholic {{approach}} to stage assignments: [...] "If a part {{is a good}} part and I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> enjoy playing it, it doesn't matter whether it's Shakespeare or modern farce … I'd hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life. It's {{a good thing for}} an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated." ...|$|E
500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look the East End in the face." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that by the end}} of the war, 80tons of bombs had fallen on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green alone, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. In Bethnal Green, 555 people were killed, and 400 were seriously injured. For the whole of Tower Hamlets, a total of 2,221 civilians were killed, and 7,472 were injured, with 46,482 houses destroyed and 47,574 damaged. [...] So badly battered was the East End that when Buckingham Palace was hit during the height of the bombing, Queen Elizabeth observed that [...] "It makes me <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look the East End in the face." [...] By the end of the war, the East End was a scene of devastation, with large areas derelict and depopulated. War production was changed quickly to making prefabricated houses, and many were installed in the bombed areas and remained common into the 1970s. Today, 1950s and 1960s architecture dominates the housing estates of the area such as the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, much of which was built as a show-piece of the 1951 Festival of Britain.|$|E

500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} college achievements, whether Flutie {{was too small}} to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television [...] "Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?", he answered [...] "Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak if you feel like that, and maybe I am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 May 2010, Modrić {{was awarded}} with a new six-year {{contract}} that ran until 2016; he said, [...] "Tottenham Hotspur gave me my chance in the Premier League and I {{want to go on}} to achieve great success here with them. Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, but I have no interest in going anywhere. Last season's top-four finish was an indication of where we are as a Club and I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> continue to improve and go on to achieve everything I want to at Spurs".|$|E
2500|$|To {{enhance the}} {{intensity}} between his characters, Bhansali wanted a correctly intense reference point for Hrithik and Aishwarya's feelings and conversations. Bhansali {{said that he}} thought the sentiment of thwarted passion and smothered intensity of star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet expressed his protagonists' inexpressible feelings very well. Hence he included dialogues from Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet in Guzaarish. Bhansali insisted on Zeffirelli's version since to him [...] "..his work is the ultimate tribute to Shakespeare's love story. So many times, I've wanted to do my own version of Romeo & Juliet. But one look at Zeffirelli's film makes me <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never equal his beauty grandeur harmony and principal casting." [...] Though {{it was difficult to}} obtain permission to use the materials, an adamant Bhansali accomplished the feat. He said," [...] This was my only chance to pay homage to one of my all-time favourite screen romances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1965 season, Womack claimed that he was ready to pitch at the Triple-A level, the highest level of American {{professional}} baseball below the major leagues. [...] "I've had three pretty good years in a row", he said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do the job." [...] Womack received his wish, as he was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on May 3. He went 10–4 with a 2.17 ERA in 34 games that season, making a return {{to the start}}ing rotation as he started 13 games, six of which he completed. In 145 innings, he allowed 110 hits and 41 walks, striking out 73 batters. Though he did not lead the International League or his team in any categories, he finish second on the squad in victories (tied with Jack Curtis), winning percentage (.714), shutouts (three), innings pitched, walks and wild pitches (five, tied with Tom Dukes). Following the season, to ensure no other team could claim him, the Yankees added Womack to their 40-man roster and on October 19, he was promoted to the New York Yankees.|$|E

2500|$|After making {{just one}} {{substitute}} appearance for Stevenage, Madjo joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November 2011. He aimed to [...] "prove himself" [...] at the club, having previously had a trial at Vale Park {{before he turned}} professional at Bristol City in 2005. He made his debut for the club a day after signing, playing 80 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United; he was praised for his performance despite being 'rusty' and short of match fitness. In his second appearance for the club, he scored only his fourth league goal in the Football League, as he [...] "displayed quick feet, an assured touch and deadly instincts in front of goal" [...] to net the winning goal of a 2–1 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge. He dedicated the goal to coach Geoff Horsfield, after the pair spent many hours on the training ground working on Madjo's finishing skills. For his performance, Madjo was named on the League Two Team of the Week. He scored a 60-minute hat-trick in his third appearance for the club, a 4–0 home win over Aldershot Town; despite this he stated that [...] "I didn't play that well in the first half. I <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give a lot more." [...] For this achievement he was named on the League Two Team of the Week for a second time. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored four goals in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
