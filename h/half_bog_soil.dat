40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the activity of dehydrogenases and urease in forest peat soils of different fertility. There were selected 23 experimental plots localised in central and northern Poland. The research was conducted on forest fens, transition bogs and raised bogs. The biggest differences in soil physical and chemical properties were detected between fen and raised <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> while raised <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> and transition <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> differed the least. Statistically significant differences between particular subtypes of peat soils were observed for soil pH-H 2 O, pH-KCl, C/N ratio as well as the content of organic carbon, nitrogen, calcium and potassium. The highest average dehydrogenase activity in the soil surface level was observed in fen soils, and the lowest – in raised <b>bogs</b> <b>soils.</b> The results obtained on urease activity were similar. Differences in urease activity in the studied soil types were shown. Dehydrogenase activity did not reveal statistically significant diversity.

Minimum diurnal tissue water potentials of D. paleata are significantly {{lower than those of}} D. raillardioides, despite the moister condition of <b>bog</b> <b>soil.</b> The tissue osmotic potential at full hydration of D. paleata is significantly lower than that of D. raillardioides.

Dubautia paleata is thus able to maintain positive turgor to lower water potentials than D. raillardioides. Lack of a lowered, in D. raillardioides may therefore contribute to exclusion of that species from the bog habitat. Preliminary data suggest a significantly greater hydraulic resistance for D. paleata than for D. raillardioides, probably due to higher root resistance caused by the reduced condition of the waterlogged bog substrate. The difference in hydraulic resistance could help account for the contrasting water deficits of the two species...|$|R

Both soybean and paddy field were reclaimed from wetland. We observed that reclamation significantly reduced SOC content in 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm soil layers in meadow albic soil and meadow marsh soil, and 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm soil layers in peat <b>bog</b> <b>soil,</b> {{there were no significant}} difference in SOC contents in soil layers under 0 - 30 or 0 - 40 cm before and after reclamation.

Though wetland reclamation reduced the SOC content, it hasn’t changed the regularity of SOC vertical distribution. The relationships between SOC content and soil depth in wetlands and farm lands all could be described by exponential functions in three types of soils.

40|$|The {{beginnings}} of the continuous human presence and of pastoral activities in the high mountainous region of Central Europe have recently become a frequently discussed topic in both archaeology and palaeoecology. In extreme environments such as the high Alpine main ridge and adjacent areas, highly adaptive subsistence strategies were required to exploit natural resources available in the subalpine and alpine zones. Such strategies were determined by changing environmental, social, and economic conditions. To investigate the relationships between settlement dynamics, human impact, and Holocene climatic changes, we studied the valleys of the Silvretta Massif in the central Eastern Alps between the Paznaun (Austria) and Lower Engadine valleys (Switzerland). We are presenting new archaeological, palaeoecological, and pedological evidence of continuous human activities from the Early Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age (5, 500 – 800 BC).

This work reviews published studies on microbial processes linked to carbon and nitrogen transformations in the soils of the Ljubljana marsh, a drained peatland positioned close to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This region is known for its dramatic diversity of animal and plant life, but below ground it hides diverse bacterial and archaeal communities that are highly responsive to environmental changes and make the Ljubljana marsh soils a good source of N 2 O and CO 2, and a sink for CH 4. Methanogenesis is highly restricted in these soils due to competition for electron donors with iron reducers. In addition, methane is efficiently removed by methanotrophs, which are highly active, especially in the soil layers exposed to the changing water table. Denitrification is limited by electron acceptors and in deeper soil layers also by carbon, which becomes more recalcitrant with depth. Nitrification involves bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers with ammonia oxidation rates being {{among the highest in the}} world. Interestingly, ammonia-oxidising Thaumarchaeota in acidic <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> thrive only on ammonia released through mineralisation of organic matter and are incapable of oxidising added mineral ammonia. The soils of the Ljubljana marsh are rich in bacterial laccase-like genes, which may encode enzymes involved in lignin degradation and are therefore interesting for bioexploitations.

We compare the uptake kinetics for NH 4 –N and different fractions of DOM during soil and salmon leachate additions by evaluating the uptake of organic forms of carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), and proteinaceous DOM, as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorescence. Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils. We also used DOM collected from <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> and salmon carcasses to perform additions in the upland forest stream. DOC uptake velocity ranged from 0. 010 to 0. 063 mm s- 1 and DON uptake velocity ranged from 0. 015 to 0. 086 mm s- 1, which provides evidence for the whole-stream uptake of allochtho-nous DOM. These findings imply that wetlands could potentially be an important source of DOM to support stream heterotrophic production. There {{was no significant difference in}} the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P> 0. 05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P < 0. 05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein-like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satis-fying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought...|$|R

Total Hg is positivelyFor an annual cycle, upland soils were sinks for both HgT and OC, correlated with OC in soil solution (Aastrup et al., 1991),while <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> were sinks for HgT but sources of OC. Fluxes to the stream and runoff waters (Lee and Iverfeldt, 1991; Jo-lagg accounted for 184 % of the HgT and 87 % of the OC transported hansson et al., 1991; Johansson and Iverfeldt, 1994; Hur-from the watershed outlet. We speculate that HgT was lost in the lagg by both volatilization and soil accumulation. Total Hg and dissolved ley et al., 1995; Kolka et al., 1999 b), and in lake water...|$|R
