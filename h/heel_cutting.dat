50|$|When {{the company}} was first formed it was to make sole and <b>heel</b> <b>cutting</b> knives for the local {{footwear}} industry. Within a few years this diversified into {{a wide range of}} machinery for industry, as well as the first refrigeration plant for the Smithfield meat market in London. Around 1897 the part of the business devoted to the footwear industry was sold off to the British United Shoe Machinery Co, and the business directed its efforts more towards printing, grinding, and knitwear machines. However, by 1903 they made their first internal combustion petrol engines and petrol-paraffin engines, and gradually engine manufacture was to become their main business. However, William Henry Dorman was a prolific inventor and between 1894 and 1914 there are 72 patents to his name, many related to the mechanisation of the manufacture of footwear, but also on diverse topics such as the trouser press, four-wheel-drive motor cars, and a method for separating cream from milk. Apart from the engines that were later to dominate the business, a great many other products were made, many of which were equipment for manufacturing industry.|$|E
50|$|D. macropodum, {{like other}} {{species in the}} genus, can be grown as an {{ornamental}} evergreen shrub or small tree, when its main attractions are its large leaves and pink-flushed new growth. A sheltered situation in moist but well-drained soil is recommended. The newly emerged shoots are easily damaged by frost. Although growing to become a small tree in its natural habitat, in gardens it is more often found as a well-branched shrub. Propagation is by <b>heel</b> <b>cuttings</b> or fresh seed.|$|R
25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it virtually impossible to strike stem <b>cuttings,</b> and <b>heel</b> <b>cuttings</b> have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|R
50|$|Banksia nobilis subsp. nobilis {{has long}} been a popular garden plant because of its {{prolific}} flowering. It prefers heavy, gravelly soil with excellent drainage, in a sunny position.

Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it virtually impossible to strike stem <b>cuttings,</b> and <b>heel</b> <b>cuttings</b> have been met with limited success.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{potential}} {{propagation by seed}} and cuttings of the Azorean native Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull. for landscape conservation. With that purpose we have performed several germination and cuttings trials, using plant material from wild populations of this species. In the germination trials, we tested the effects of photoperiod length (8 and 16 [*]h), temperature (10, 15, 20, and 20 – 10 °C), seed age (6, 108, and 270 days), temperature of seed storage (4 °C and room temperature), and seed surface sterilization on the germination characteristics. In the cuttings trials, we tested the effects of stem cutting type, cultural conditions, cuttings’ harvest month, and rooting substrates on the rooting percentages. The best percentages of germination, 93 and 90 %, were obtained with fresh seeds and surface sterilized and sown under an 8 [*]h photoperiod and with temperatures of 10 °C or 15 °C, respectively; germination after seed storage during 270 days is significantly superior (71 %) when seeds are stored at 4 °C. The best percentages of rooting were achieved for straight (96 %) or <b>heel</b> <b>cuttings</b> (90 %) harvested in March, planted on soil from natural stands of C. vulgaris and Erica azorica Hochst., outdoors in half shade, and partially covered with transparent polyethylene film...|$|R
40|$|Stackhousia tryonii Bailey is a rare, serpentine-endemic herb, with {{potential}} {{for use in}} phytoremediation and /or phytomining. This study evaluates the use of herbaceous <b>heel</b> <b>cuttings</b> to propogate S. tryonii on three rooting media [sand, Medium 1; a commercial nursery mix, Medium 11; and sand: peat moss: perlite (2 : 2 : 1; v/v), Medium 111] following the application of plant growth hormones, viz. indole- 3 -butyric acid and naphthalene acetic acid (both as pure and commercial formulations, viz. Clonex Gel-green, Gel-purple and Gel-red), and honey. Cutting survival, rooting percentage, the number of primary and secondary roots produced, {{the length of the}} longest root and the total root length were evaluated after 10 weeks. Results show that there was a positive (P< 0. 001) influence of plant growth regulator treatments on cuttings' survival. Medium 111 failed to support survoval of cuttings. Percentage rooting (as a proportion of original number of cuttings was 10 - 30 % higher in Medium 1 than in Medium 11. Cuttings treated with Clonex Gel-red, IBA at 1000 ppm and NAA at 250 ppm had 60 - 70 % higher percentage rooting in Medium 1 than in Medium 11. Total number of primary roots per rooted cuttings was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in Medium 1 than in Medium 11. We conclude that cuttings from mature plants of S. tryonii could be effectively used to multiply S. tryonii, particularly with sand as rooting medium prior to treatment of cuttings with Clonex Gel-red...|$|R

5000|$|Santoku blade {{geometry}} {{incorporates the}} sheep's foot tip. A sheep's foot design essentially draws the spine ("backstrap") {{down to the}} front, with very little clearance above the horizontal cutting plane when the blade is resting naturally from <b>heel</b> to forward <b>cutting</b> edge. Providing a more linear cutting edge, the Santoku has limited [...] "rocking" [...] travel (in comparison to a German/Western-style chef's knife). The Santoku {{may be used in}} a rocking motion; however, very little cutting edge makes contact with the surface due to the extreme radius of the tip and very little [...] "tip travel" [...] occurs due to the short cantilever span from contact landing to tip. An example of this limitation can be demonstrated in dicing an onion—a Western knife generally slices downward and then rocks the tip forward to complete a cut; the Santoku relies more on a single downward cut and even landing from heel to tip, thus using less of a rocking motion than Western style cutlery.|$|R
50|$|Coming {{into the}} game ranked #1 in both polls, Duke hosted senior night, honoring the National Player of the Year and all-time ACC leading scorer J.J. Redick and two-time National Defensive Player of the Year Shelden Williams. North Carolina, the {{defending}} national champions, had lost the whole core {{of the team that}} won it all the year before, but came {{into the game}} on a 7-game winning streak. Freshmen Tyler Hansbrough and Danny Green led Carolina as well as veterans Reyshawn Terry and David Noel. ESPN broadcast the game on all three of its channels as part of its first ESPN Full Circle coverage, showing a marathon of past games hours before tipoff. Duke led early 13-2 as Redick caught fire and hit his first five shots. The Tar <b>Heels</b> fought back, <b>cutting</b> the deficit to one by halftime. The Tar Heels stormed out to a 72-62 lead as Hansbrough and Terry starting hitting their shots in the second half. After a timeout, Duke's Williams hook shot pulled Duke back within eight, but Hansbrough recovered a loose ball 25 feet from the hoop answered with a three-pointer to beat the shot clock. DeMarcus Nelson then hit 3-pointers on 3 successive possessions to put the Devils back to within 3 with 1:31 left. However, that was as close as it would get. The Heels hit their free throws down the stretch, Redick missed 15 of his last 16 shots, and DeMarcus Nelson shot an air ball that resulted in a shot clock violation that prevented a late Duke rally, leading to a final score of 83-76. The game was watched by 3.78 million households on ESPN and ESPN2.|$|R
