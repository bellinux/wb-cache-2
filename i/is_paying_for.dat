5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he <b>is</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E

25|$|DuPont {{has used}} PFOA for over 50 years at its Washington Works plant near Parkersburg, WV. Area {{residents}} sued DuPont in August 2001 and claimed DuPont released PFOA {{in excess of}} their community guideline of 1 part per billion resulting in lower property values and increased risk of illness.

500|$|Nursing Homes: A second {{aspect to}} {{reimbursement}} {{pertains to the}} nursing home. In many cases, patients who are transferred {{to a nursing home}} from a hospital will have a portion of their nursing home stay reimbursed by Medicare. In these cases, Medicare <b>is</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> some kind of rehabilitative care. Medicare will not reimburse any room and board coverage in the nursing home for patients on hospice. Occasionally, patients who would be better served receiving hospice care will be [...] "rehabilitated" [...] in the nursing home so as to defray the costs of the room and board.|$|E
500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There is simply too much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't keep you in the club unless someone else <b>is</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> the drinks." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly <b>is</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying for and what the farming industry <b>is</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for.</b> Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We {{are going to have a}} lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E
