In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals.

500|$|Amid {{the other}} {{difficulties}} in building new armed forces for the DRC, in early 2007 the integration and training process was distorted as the DRC government under Kabila attempted {{to use it}} to gain more control over the dissident general Laurent Nkunda. A hastily negotiated verbal agreement in Rwanda saw three government FAC brigades integrated with Nkunda's former ANC 81st and 83rd Brigades in what was called mixage. Mixage brought multiple factions into composite brigades, but without the 45-day retraining provided by brassage, and it seems that actually, the process was limited to exchanging battalions between the FAC and Nkunda brigades in North Kivu, without further integration. Due to Nkunda's troops having greater cohesion, Nkunda effectively gained control of all five brigades, which was not the intention of the DRC central government. However, after Nkunda used the mixage brigades to fight the FDLR, strains arose between the FARDC and Nkunda-loyalist troops within the brigades and they fell apart in the last days of August 2007. The International Crisis <b>Group</b> <b>says</b> that 'by 30 August [...] Nkunda's troops had left the mixed brigades and controlled {{a large part of the}} Masisi and Rutshuru territories' (of North Kivu).|$|E

2500|$|After the 2006 coup, the {{military}} junta appointed {{a committee to}} investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week {{he said there was}} insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying <b>group,</b> <b>says</b> that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen.
