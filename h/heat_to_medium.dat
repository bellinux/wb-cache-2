40|$|The same {{practical}} precautions {{that apply}} to thermocouples also apply to RTD’s, i. e., use shields and twisted-pair wire, use proper sheathing, avoid stress and steep gradients, use large extension wire, keep good documentation and use a guarded integrating dvm. In addition, the following precautions should be observed. Construction- Due to its construction, the RTD is somewhat more fragile than the thermocouple, and precautions {{must be taken to}} protect it. Self-Heating- Unlike the thermocouple, the RTD is not self-powered. A current must be passed through the device to provide a voltage that can be measured. The current causes Joule (I 2 R) heating within the RTD, changing its temperature. This self-heating appears as a measurement error. Consequently, attention must be paid to the magnitude of the measurement current supplied by the ohmmeter. A typical value for selfheating error is 1 2 ºC per milliwatt in free air. Obviously, an RTD immersed in a thermally conductive medium will distribute its Joule <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> the <b>medium,</b> and the error due to self-heating will be smaller. The same RTD that rises 1 ºC per milliwatt in free air will rise only 1 10 ºC per milliwatt in air which is flowing at the rate of one meter per second. 10 Figure 46 To reduce self-heating errors, use the minimum ohms measurement current that will still give the resolution you require, and use the largest RTD you can that will still give good response time. Obviously, there are compromises to be considered. Thermal Shunting- Thermal shunting is the act of altering the measurement temperature by inserting a measurement transducer. Thermal shunting is more a problem with RTD’s than with thermocouples, as the physical bulk of an RTD is greater than that of a thermocouple...|$|R

An extension of the eddy dissipation concept is incorporated, allowing one to investigate the roles of the wind speed and its direction on the fire growth, heat flux distribution and smoke products, such as carbon monoxide and soot. The predicted flame shape compares well with the measurements for an intermediate-scale fire. The outcome of the study is interesting, and the interaction model between turbulence and combustion is indeed adequate. The prediction indicates that interaction between the large object and fire environment combined with the influence of wind conditions dramatically affects the continuous flame shape. The increase of the wind speed results in an alteration of the distribution of the incident <b>heat</b> fluxes <b>to</b> the engulfed fuselage skin for a case where the fire and fuselage are of comparable size.

40|$|The {{employment}} of structured catalysts characterized by highly conductive carriers {{can result in}} improving the heat transfer along the catalytic bed, affording high performance with a flattened radial temperature gradient. This study focused on the Steam Reforming (SR) process intensification obtained by deposing the catalyst on a Silicon Carbide (SiC) monolith (porous walls, honeycomb shape), characterized by excellent thermal conductivity and mechanical resistance. Experimental tests carried out on SiC catalytic honeycomb monolith demonstrated that the physical properties of the support resulted in a marked system performances enhancement. One of the most relevant limitation in SR processes is the difficulty in providing <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> the catalytic system in the operating high temperatures. The high thermal conductivity of the SiC allows <b>to</b> minimize <b>heat</b> transfer resistance from the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> <b>to</b> the catalytic volume and optimize the thermal management along the catalyst, so increasing the heat flux toward the reaction volume and in turn maximizing the reforming reactions rate.

The comparison among the performance of the structured catalysts and the commercial 57 - 4 MQ, provided by Katalco-JM, highlights the choice of structured catalysts, which require a lower temperature outside of the reactor, increasing the process efficiency.
