5|$|However, by November 1900 the South Lancashire Electric Traction and Power Company had {{acquired}} the shares. The {{first section of}} tramway opened on 20 October 1902 between Lowton and Four Lanes Ends via Leigh and Atherton. The company got into financial difficulty and in turn became Lancashire United Tramways later Lancashire United Transport. On 16 December 1933, the last tram service ran from Leigh to Four Lane <b>Ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next day trolley buses took over.|$|E
5|$|In North White Plains, {{the area}} that the road passes through becomes a little less {{developed}} as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the traffic circle where the BRP <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam.|$|E

5|$|In Shine Runners, {{the player}} must collect Shine Sprites (an object from Super Mario Sunshine). The player can attack other racers {{to take away}} a Shine Sprite from them, and racers with the fewest Shine Sprites are {{eliminated}} from the game over time. In single player, if the human player is eliminated from the round, the game <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> results are randomized.|$|E
5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes sense. If the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|NY174 and NY175 {{begin to}} curve to the {{northeast}} as they become parallel with another unsigned county road (CR150), passing Marcellus County Park along the way. The roads remain as such until an intersection where the county road <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two state routes split. In downtown Marcellus, the terrain is flat, with residential homes and commercial businesses surrounding the road. At the split, NY174 heads to the west through {{the main street of}} the village, while NY175 heads eastward towards Syracuse.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines that dot the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, Route 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 (exit 30), the freeway <b>ends,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> route becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), {{but has no}} northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615, which also connects to County Route 527.|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated {{on the former}} BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|DE 202 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 13 Bus. (Market Street) {{in the city}} of Wilmington, heading north on two-lane undivided Concord Avenue. The road passes homes and businesses {{in the northern part of}} the city. Concord Avenue crosses several streets including Washington Street and Baynard Boulevard. At the intersection with the latter, the road becomes four lanes and becomes a divided highway at the Franklin Street intersection. After passing under CSX’s Philadelphia Subdivision, DE 202 reaches an interchange with I-95 and US 202, where DE 202 <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road continues north as part of US 202 (Concord Pike).|$|E
5|$|Each unit {{is governed}} by a {{character}} class system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player must restart the level.|$|E

5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition <b>ends.</b> <b>And</b> <b>the</b> movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Homer gets a {{magazine}} loaded with personality tests and quizzes {{his friends and}} family with them. Later on, he takes his own test which reveals that has only three years left to live. Terrified of his supposedly impending death, he develops insomnia and goes insane. Homer visits the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's psychiatrist, who suggests that he take a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to Florida and find themselves {{in the middle of a}} raucous spring break when they get there. Marge wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attends a concert featuring Joe C. and Kid Rock. Homer becomes the life of spring break until it <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wild college students return to their studies.|$|E

5|$|I-195 curves {{southeast}} and passes under the BWI Trail {{ahead of its}} partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard), {{also known as the}} Airport Loop. The Airport Loop provides access to long-term parking lots, the consolidated rental car facility, hotels, cargo and general aviation facilities, and the BWI Rail Station. The circumferential highway also provides indirect access to I-97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. At this interchange, I-195 <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roadway continues as MD 995A towards the entrance to BWI Airport.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks {{travelled}} to Paris on New Year's Eve and on 1 January faced France at Parc des Princes. The {{match was}} France's first Test ever. French captain Henri Amand gave the All Blacks choice of <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kick off. Although the All Blacks dominated, France scored a try to Noel Cessieux {{in the first}} half; the half ended 18–3 to the All Blacks. Georges Jérôme then scored for France after the break to make it 18–8 for the All Blacks. The All Blacks ended up scoring another six tries {{for a total of}} ten, and a 38–8 win. The eight points, and two tries scored by France were as many as any team in the British Isles had against the All Blacks.|$|E
