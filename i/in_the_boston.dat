5|$|After Jefferson's {{retirement}} from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line an 1800 pamphlet by Hamilton which attacked his conduct and character.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919.

Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E

5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{routinely}} {{votes for}} the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County.

5|$|The {{game was}} only {{available}} {{on television in}} the Chicago and Seattle markets, because a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, also on the network, was broadcast by more affiliates.

5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Boston, {{brought up in a}} {{religious}} and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution {{at the expense of the}} colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{successful}} operations off North Africa, Massachusetts {{was taken}} in for an overhaul <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> Navy Yard. After the refitting, the ship sailed for the Pacific theater, and arrived in Nouméa on 4 March. The battleship supported operations in the South Pacific over the next months, including guarding convoy lanes, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding Japanese positions on various islands, including Nauru (8 December 1943) and Kwajalein (30 January 1944). Returning to carrier protection after the latter bombardment, Massachusetts provided anti-aircraft defense while Allied air attacks were sent against Saipan, Tinian and Guam; she also supported later invasions of the Caroline Islands and Hollandia. After bombarding Ponape Island on 1 May, the ship set course for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul and to have her gun barrels relined, as they had worn out.|$|E
5|$|I-495 forms a wide loop {{around the}} outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate {{highways}} in Massachusetts include U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a general prohibition on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> area. A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet.

Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E
