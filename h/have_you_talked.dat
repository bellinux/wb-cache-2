30|$|In {{contrast}} to these challenges, {{many of the}} nursing students credited supportive nursing faculty members with assisting them through the process to receive approval for testing accommodations. Students mentioned teachers on several occasions as the impetus or the support structure. Taylor shared, “I had a teacher that I went to and spoke {{with him in his}} office and he kind of told me that I needed to look into it and so I went to my doctor…he wrote a note for the school for the student services, and when I had that, then they set up accommodations for my testing.” She added, “Many of the teachers have this big open-door policy for everyone.” Emerson also noted, “and I went to talk to my professor and he was like, ‘are you sure you don’t have anxiety? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> to your doctor about it?’ And I was like, ‘Yea, I have,’ but, I was just really in denial’ (fanning herself with her hands). And he was like, ‘you really should look into it, I think it would help a lot.’” Students appear to appreciate the support offered by their faculty members and suggest that many students would not make the effort to secure testing accommodations without the encouragement of their teachers.|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} {{the development of an}} evidence-based education program for adults about childhood sexual abuse (CSA), called Prevent It! Uniquely, the primary goal of this program was to change the behaviour of participants, as well as to increase knowledge about CSA and positive attitudes towards it. A comprehensive review shows no previous similar approach. The program includes a detailed manual to allow standardized administration by trained facilitators, as well as multiple video segments from CSA survivors and professionals. A total of 23 program workshops were run, with 366 adults participating. Of these, 312 (85 %) agreed {{to take part in the}} study. All completed baseline ratings prior to the program and 195 (63 % of study sample) completed follow-up assessments at 3 -months. There were no significant differences between the demographic make-up of the baseline group and the follow-up group. Assessments included demographic data, knowledge, attitudes, and several measures of behaviour (our primary outcome variable). Behavioural questions asked individuals to select behaviours used in the previous 3 -months from a list of options. Questions also included asking how many times in the previous 3 -months <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about healthy sexual development or child sexual abuse with a child you know; suspected a child was sexually abused; taken steps to protect a child; or reported suspected sexual abuse to police or child welfare? The majority of attendees were women, with the commonest age group being between 30 – 39 years old. Approximately 33 % had experienced CSA themselves. At 3 -month follow-up there were highly statistically significant improvements in several aspects of behaviour and knowledge, and attitudes regarding CSA. For example, the number of subjects actively looking for evidence of CSA increased from 46 % at baseline to 81 % at follow-up, while the number of subjects who actively took steps to protect children increased from 25 % at baseline to 48 % at follow-up. For general public adults, this is the first program designed using the current evidence base for effective training in CSA examining longer-term outcomes and the first to focus on actual behavioural outcomes. The results suggest it is highly effective and support its widespread use...|$|E
