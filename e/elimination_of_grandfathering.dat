Currently, twice a year, each main airport allocates its slots and then, at a IATA conference, negotiations and slot exchanges alleviate the possible mismatch between requests and allocations. By reproducing the current regulations and best practice, SOSTA allows the slot allocation for an entire network of airports. Using real data, our experimental analysis shows that SOSTA can deal with all the European airports within a good computational time.

5000|$|On July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications {{announced}} that it would sell its entire television group, including WCIV, to Sinclair. As part of the deal, Sinclair was planning to sell the license assets of WMMP to Howard Stirk Holdings (owned by conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams), but would still operate the station through shared services and joint sales agreements. However, in December 2013, FCC Video Division Chief Barbara Kreisman ruled that [...] "the proposed transactions would result in the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grandfathered</b> status <b>of</b> certain local marketing agreements and thus cause the transactions to violate our local TV ownership rules." ...|$|R

[...] It was asserted that the deal might only be legal if the affected stations were operated under shared services agreements. Sinclair restructured the deal in March 2014, choosing to sell WHP-TV, WMMP and WABM, and terminate an SSA with the Cunningham-owned Fox affiliate WTAT in Charleston to acquire the Allbritton-owned stations in those markets (WCIV, WHTM-TV and WBMA-LD, while also creating a new duopoly between the ABC and CW affiliates in Birmingham), as well as foregoing any operational or financial agreements with the buyers of the stations being sold to other parties.|$|R
5000|$|The planned {{acquisition}} was {{hit with}} a number of pitfalls due to conflicts between already Sinclair-owned or controlled stations in Allbritton's markets, and the FCC's recent actions involving local marketing agreements (LMAs) and joint sales agreements. Sinclair would have sold its existing stations in several Allbritton marketsâ€”WABM and WTTO in Birmingham, Alabama and WHP-TV in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston, South Carolina to Howard Stirk Holdings, a company owned by conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams. The stations would have remained operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement. In December 2013, FCC Video Division Chief Barbara Kreisman sent a letter demanding information from Sinclair Broadcast Group on the financial aspects of its [...] "sidecar" [...] operations, and warned that in these three markets, [...] "the proposed transactions would result in the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grandfathered</b> status <b>of</b> certain local marketing agreements and thus cause the transactions to violate our local TV ownership rules."
