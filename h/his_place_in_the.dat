50|$|Professor Byrne, however, {{believes}} {{that there may have}} been an interregnum in Ulaid between 735-750. This would give a possible reign for Indrechtach over the Dal nAraide from 727-741 if this were true and would explain <b>his</b> <b>placing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> king lists of the Dal nAraide.|$|R

5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make much of an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E
5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E

In spite of heavy competition from Toldo, Buffon regained the starting goalkeeping spot for the fourth match of the qualification series, away to Romania, and was the starting goalkeeper for the remaining four matches under Giovanni Trapattoni as Italy qualified with an unbeaten record.|$|E
5|$|Given {{began the}} 2016–17 season as first choice 'keeper due to Butland being sidelined. On 27 August 2016, he conceded an unfortunate own goal in a 1–0 away defeat to Everton. Given had palmed a Leighton Baines penalty onto the post but the ball rebounded against {{his head and}} went over the line. After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side to Lee Grant. He was {{released}} by Stoke {{at the end of}} the 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|He {{played over}} 30 games for his {{national}} side, including four at the 1998 World Cup in France.

5|$|Heskey was an England {{international}} at under-16, under-18, under-21, B {{and senior}} levels. He made his England debut against Hungary in a 1–1 draw in 1999.

After a long lay-off from international duty, Heskey was recalled to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007. He retired from international football following the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having attained 62 caps and scored 7 goals for his country.|$|E
5|$|In February 1818, {{during his}} last term at Oxford, and again {{following}} his father's wishes, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, a pocket borough owned by his cousin Charles, Earl of Ailesbury.

5|$|Irvine {{started the}} first match of the 1963–64 campaign, a 1–3 defeat away to Ipswich Town. However, he {{suffered}} a broken hand during the game, which left him unable to play throughout the following months. Even after recovery, he remained sidelined, unable to regain <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting eleven. Irvine did not play again for Burnley until 30 March 1964, when he was chosen to play at inside-right in the away tie against Bolton Wanderers. Despite Irvine's fifth goal in four league starts, Burnley were beaten 1–2. He retained <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team {{for the next two}} matches, before returning to his more preferred centre forward position for the 0–3 loss at home to Liverpool on 14 April 1964. He scored three more goals in the final two matches of the season, including two in the 7–2 win against Tottenham Hotspur. His frequent goalscoring led to him becoming a more integral part of the Burnley side during the following campaign, in which he scored three goals in the first six matches, although the team achieved only four draws and two losses. He was dropped from the starting line-up for the away match at Birmingham City on 12 September 1964. The team suffered three defeats in the following four fixtures, and Irvine was reinstated to the team for the trip to West Bromwich Albion two weeks later. He immediately marked his return with both Burnley goals in a 2–1 win, the team's first away victory of the season. Irvine retained <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side for most of the remainder of the campaign, and in December he scored seven goals in four games, including a hat-trick in the 4–0 win over Fulham. Despite missing {{a small portion of the}} campaign through injury, Irvine ended the season with a total of 22 goals in 37 league and cup matches, one more goal than centre forward partner Lochhead.|$|E

5|$|Karthik was {{recalled}} to the Indian ODI {{team for}} the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy following a great domestic season and IPL performance. He scored back to back centuries in the two warm up games sealing <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{team for the}} tournament. Unfortunately these centuries will not be counted in his first class statistics as the teams were playing a 15- side team. He scored an unbeaten 51 in India's group match against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took <b>his</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 2009, O'Gara overtook Jonny Wilkinson {{to become}} the top Six Nations point scorer ever.

O'Gara started against Australia in the first match of Ireland's 2009 November Series, scoring 10 points.
