5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the <b>Iraqi</b> government by including <b>Iraqi</b> citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the <b>Iraqi</b> Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{the units}} {{moved to the}} Saudi border, many were {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 <b>Iraqi</b> armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another <b>Iraqi</b> convoy of armored vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed {{the first and last}} vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the <b>Iraqi</b> troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.|$|E
5|$|Despite these <b>Iraqi</b> threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the <b>Iraqi</b> air defense systems and effectively destroyed the <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many <b>Iraqi</b> pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E

50|$|Sweden {{has seen}} a surge of {{refugees}} from Iraq since 2007. Sweden currently accepts {{more than half of}} all asylum applications from <b>Iraqis</b> in Europe. In 2006, more than 9,000 <b>Iraqis</b> fled their country and came to Sweden seeking shelter, a four times increase over 2005. Sweden's immigration authority expects up to 40,000 <b>Iraqis</b> seeking asylum in 2007. An estimated 79,200 <b>Iraqis</b> call Sweden their home. Many <b>Iraqis</b> fled to Sweden during the 90's as well. Current refugees like Sweden because many of their relatives are there and because of the generous refugee policies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iraqis</b> were displeased with Soviet air-to-air missiles. Pakistani {{technicians}} {{were reported}} to have helped the <b>Iraqis</b> modify some MiG-21s to carry the French-made R550 Magic air-to-air missile. The <b>Iraqis</b> claimed to have used a MiG-21 so equipped to down an F-14.|$|R
5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the {{air superiority}} of the {{coalition}} forces {{was so great that}} the majority of <b>Iraqi</b> Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the DISCOM was {{deployed}} to Turkey {{in support of}} Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom I. The DISCOM simultaneously supported peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and deployed a logistics task force to support Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom I throughout Iraq. In 2004, the DISCOM re{{deployed to}} Southwest Asia in Support of Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom II. In addition to the organic DISCOM units, the 225th Forward Support Battalion from Hawaii and the 230th Support Battalion from North Carolina deployed to support logistical operations for Task Force Danger. Finally, in 2005, the DISCOM redeployed to Germany to reconstitute and prepare for future contingency operations. The DISCOM was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its contributions during Operation <b>Iraqi</b> freedom II.|$|E
50|$|While <b>Iraqis</b> are {{of several}} ethnic groups, most <b>Iraqis,</b> {{as a people}} with an ancient civic culture and {{tradition}} of multilingualism, have historically engaged in healthy inter-communal relations, and favoured a common identity, and due to this <b>Iraqis</b> as a whole {{can be seen to}} bear some characteristics of an ethnic group.|$|R

50|$|Turkey {{experienced}} a large influx of <b>Iraqis</b> between {{the years of}} 1988 and 1991 due to both the Iran-Iraq war and the first Gulf war, with around 50,000 to 460,000 <b>Iraqis</b> entering the country.However, Turkey took a different approach following the 2003 invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the government took strong measures in ensuring there be no mass influx of <b>Iraqis</b> for the third time. Thus, despite an approximate of two million <b>Iraqis</b> fleeing to neighbouring Syria and Jordan, only 10,000 had arrived in Turkey.|$|R
5|$|In {{support of}} Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom I, the 18th Military Police Brigade crossed into Iraq on 22 March 2003. During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 <b>Iraqi</b> prisoners and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new <b>Iraqi</b> Police Service and rebuilding <b>Iraqi</b> police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 <b>Iraqi</b> police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Mask of Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to the <b>Iraqi</b> Army. While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an <b>Iraqi</b> Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of <b>Iraqi</b> aeroplanes. The <b>Iraqi</b> Army lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the <b>Iraqi</b> historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in the <b>Iraqi</b> nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed <b>Iraqi</b> soldiers. This further enraged the <b>Iraqi</b> public against the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1991, <b>Iraqi</b> President Saddam Hussein met in Basra {{with the}} two <b>Iraqi</b> army corps commanders who would lead the operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January.

50|$|Public {{perception}} is that the <b>Iraqis</b> were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the <b>Iraqis</b> did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, <b>Iraqis</b> raised a flag and said, “Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq.” So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the <b>Iraqis</b> called it ‘sensitive,’ we go in with four people.In 1998, the inspection team went to a site. It was the Baath Party headquarters, like going to Republican Party headquarters or Democratic Party headquarters. The <b>Iraqis</b> said, “You can't come in - you can come in.

But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors to withdraw from the modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took <b>Iraqis</b> by surprise. <b>Iraqis</b> were saying, “We're playing by the rules, why aren’t you? If you're not going play by the rules, then it’s a game that we don't want to participate in.” Bill Clinton ordered the inspectors out. Saddam didn't kick them out.|$|R

50|$|On October 14, the <b>Iraqis</b> {{moved in}} once again, using {{the element of}} night attacks to advance troops, gain surprise, and place {{observation}} points in tall buildings. The Iranians would often use snipers at night, which bogged down the invading <b>Iraqis.</b> Due to repeated assaults of combined arms, the <b>Iraqis</b> managed to overtake the Iranian Chieftain tanks and Pasdaran units.|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 February 1991, two US Air Force F-15C Eagle fighters of the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, {{operating}} from Al Kharj Air Base in Saudi Arabia, intercepted a pair of <b>Iraqi</b> MiG-21s {{and a pair of}} Su-25s. All four <b>Iraqi</b> aircraft were shot down, with both Su-25s coming down in the desert not far from the <b>Iraqi</b> border with Iran.

5|$|Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew {{increasingly}} bitter on 9 March, after Qasim's forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched {{a day earlier}} by a pro-Nasser <b>Iraqi</b> RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his <b>Iraqi</b> sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing <b>Iraqi</b> communists provided Qasim.

5|$|The Su-25 {{also saw}} combat during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–88. The first Su-25s were {{commissioned}} by the <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties {{towards the end of}} the war, carrying out the bulk of <b>Iraqi</b> air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, <b>Iraqi</b> Su-25s performed up to fifteen sorties per day, each. In one recorded incident, an <b>Iraqi</b> Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian, Hawk surface-to-air missile, but the pilot managed to eject.

5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending <b>Iraqi</b> offensive.

Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy <b>Iraqi</b> reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the <b>Iraqi</b> operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Iraqi</b> {{forces were}} defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War.

5|$|An {{additional}} <b>Iraqi</b> column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These <b>Iraqi</b> tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the <b>Iraqi</b> column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, <b>Iraqi</b> T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the <b>Iraqi</b> {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units.
