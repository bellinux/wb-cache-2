The island of Martinique received a record 12inches (305mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, affecting many northern villages and communes. Le Prêcheur was devastated by an extensive <b>debris</b> <b>flow,</b> which washed away entire structures. The disaster wrought $19million (1993USD) in damage across Martinique, and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain.

25|$|The {{alluvial}} {{fans that}} spread {{out into the}} sea from valley mouths were built by previous flood and <b>debris</b> <b>flow</b> events. The modern channel systems of these alluvial fan deltas are incised into previously deposited <b>debris</b> <b>flow</b> and flood material. Scientists at the US Geological Survey measured these old deposits. They found that they are thicker than the December 1999 ones and contain larger boulders.

The friction coefficients of <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> with h/d values less than 20 agreed closely with the theoretical value for boulder <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> derived from the constitutive equations, while the friction coefficients with h/d values in the range 1000 – 10, 000 agreed roughly with the theoretical value for turbulent water flows. The friction coefficients with h/d values of 30 – 300 exceeded the theoretical value for both debris and turbulent water <b>flows.</b> These intermediate <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> were observed in experiments involving turbulent mud flows. However, a review of these experiments revealed that they may have included <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> in which the turbulent structure was not well developed, and could be considered as <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> in transition from laminar to turbulent flows. In some of the transitional <b>debris</b> <b>flows,</b> an interface dividing the flow structure into an upper turbulent-flow layer and a lower debris-flow layer was observed as reported for sediment-laden flows. The friction coefficient for transitional <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> was modeled considering the shift of this interface. The model was able to explain the value for transitional <b>debris</b> <b>flows,</b> inferring that phase transition in <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> from laminar to turbulent flows is induced by the shift of the interface...|$|R

40|$|From 12 to 14 August 2010, heavy rainstorms {{occurred}} in the Sichuan province in SW China in areas which were affected by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, inducing catastrophic <b>debris</b> <b>flows.</b> This disaster is named as "the 8. 13 debris flows". The results of the research {{presented in this paper}} show that the 8. 13 <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> are characterized by a simultaneous occurrence, rapid-onsets, destructive impacts, and disaster chain effects. They are located along the seismic fault, because the source materials mainly originate from loose deposits of landslides which were triggered by the Wenchuan Earthquake. The presence of large amounts of these loose materials on the slopes and the development of high intensity rainfall events are the main causes for the formation of these <b>debris</b> <b>flows.</b> The study of the 8. 13 <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> can provide a benchmark for the analysis of the long-term evolution of these <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> in order to make proper engineering decisions.

5000|$|<b>Debris</b> <b>flows</b> have {{volumetric}} sediment concentrations exceeding {{about 40}} to 50%, {{and the remainder}} of a flow's volume consists of water. By definition, “debris” includes sediment grains with diverse shapes and sizes, commonly ranging from microscopic clay particles to great boulders. Media reports often use the term mudflow to describe <b>debris</b> <b>flows,</b> but true mudflows are composed mostly of grains smaller than sand. On Earth's land surface, mudflows are far less common than <b>debris</b> <b>flows.</b> However, underwater mudflows are prevalent on submarine continental margins, where they may spawn turbidity currents. <b>Debris</b> <b>flows</b> in forested regions can contain large quantities of woody debris such as logs and tree stumps. Sediment-rich water floods with solid concentrations ranging from about 10 to 40% behave somewhat differently from <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> and are known as hyperconcentrated floods.

All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs, fumaroles, mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity.|$|E
30|$|In {{the early}} morning of 20 August 2014, a high-intensity/low-duration {{rainstorm}} occurred in Hiroshima City, in southwest Japan.

This heavy rainfall triggered 107 <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> and 59 shallow slides, which caused 44 injuries, and 74 deaths. 133 houses were destroyed and an additional 296 houses were severely damaged. Most of the <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> occurred in heavily weathered granite slopes, while others occurred in weathered hornfels slopes.

40|$|<b>Debris</b> <b>flows</b> {{have caused}} serious loss of human lives {{and a lot}} of damage to {{properties}} in Taiwan over the past decades. Moreover, <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> have brought massive mud causing water pollution in reservoirs and resulted in water shortage for daily life locally and affected agricultural irrigation and industrial usages seriously. A number of methods for prediction of <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> have been studied. However, the successful prediction ratio of <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> cannot always maintain a stable and reliable level. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a stable and reliable analytical model for occurrence predictions of <b>debris</b> <b>flows.</b> This study proposes an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model that was constructed by seven significant factors using back-propagation (BP) algorithm. These seven factors include (1) length of creek, (2) average slope, (3) effective watershed area, (4) shape coefficient, (5) median size of soil grain, (6) effective cumulative rainfall, and (7) effective rainfall intensity. A total of 178 potential cases of <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> collected in eastern Taiwan were fed into the 2 ANN model for training and testing. The average ratio of successful prediction reaching 93. 82 % demonstrates that the presented ANN model with seven significant factors can provide a high stable and reliable result for the prediction of risk degree of <b>debris</b> <b>flows</b> in hazard mitigation and guarding systems...|$|R

25|$|Of {{the many}} {{communities}} that {{were affected by}} the disaster, the Caraballeda fan {{was one of the}} most hard-hit. The intensity of the disaster here is a combination of two factors. First, the Caraballeda fan was heavily urbanized, with many high-rise buildings and multistory houses. Second, it lies at the mouth of the Quebrada San Julián (Saint Julian Ravine), and this watershed produced very large boulders and a massive inundated area. Approximately 1/3 of the Caraballeda fan was inundated by debris flows, and the entire fan is built of past <b>debris</b> <b>flow</b> deposits.|$|E

25|$|Heavy rains fell in December 1999 {{along the}} north-central coast of Venezuela, {{culminating}} {{in a period of}} extreme intensity from 14 to 16 December. Starting around 8 PM local time (AST) on 15 December, runoff entered channels and rushed towards the sea, picking up and depositing sediments on its way. Generally after this first wave of flooding, from the coast to just past the crest of the Sierra de Avila, these rains triggered thousands of shallow landslides that stripped soil and rock off of the landscape and sent them slipping down the mountainside. Additional water liquefied these landslides into debris flows, which are granular flows in which water mixes with high concentrations of rock and mud. The first eyewitness accounts of debris flows were from 8:30 PM on the 15th, and the final debris flows were reported between 8 and 9 AM on 16 December. Many catchments released multiple debris flows, some of which carried large boulders and tree trunks onto the alluvial fan deltas. Starting between 7 and 9 AM on the 16th and continuing until late that afternoon, a new wave of floods occurred. These floodwaters were less concentrated in sediment and were therefore able to entrain new material and incise new channels into the flood and <b>debris</b> <b>flow</b> deposits from the previous days.|$|E
