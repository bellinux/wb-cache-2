2500|$|When the ovarian follicles {{have reached}} a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> {{induction}} of final oocyte maturation is performed, generally by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Commonly, {{this is known as}} the [...] "trigger shot." [...] hCG acts as an analogue of luteinising hormone, and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Using a GnRH agonist instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh. [...] For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.|$|E

The sampling method applied in this research was stratified sampling. Soil mapping units were applied as strata. The sample within strata was determined according the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> mass movement susceptibility. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>development</b> was determined using quantitative method of color indices and proflie index. The color indices were Buntley – Westin (B – W), Harden (H), and Hurst. The profile index was determined using solum, texture, structure, and soil consistency. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> mass movement susceptibility map was taken from PSBA UGM (2001). Spatial correlation between the soil development map and the mass movement susceptibility map was analyzed using “error matrix”. The result of this research indicated that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>development</b> in the research area could be classified into three classes, i. e. class 1 (weakly develop soil); class 2 (moderately developed soil), class 3 (strongly developed soil).

With the super-addition of a nervous apparatus corresponding with the cerebrum in ourselves, it is allowable to suppose the appearance of the simplest states of consciousness, or the sensations; and it is conceivable that these may at first exist, without any power of reproducing them, as memories; and, consequently, without ideation. Still higher, an apparatus of correlation may be superadded, until, as all these organs become more developed, the condition of the highest speechless animals is attained.|$|E
60|$|Rudimentary organs in the {{individuals}} {{of the same}} species are very liable to vary in <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and in other respects. Moreover, in closely allied species, {{the degree to which the}} same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy would lead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species. Thus in the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but this may sometimes be seen. In tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class, nothing is more common, or more necessary, than the use and discovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.|$|E

40|$|Spondylosis deformans is a {{degenerative}} {{disease of the}} spine exhibiting the presence {{of one or more}} osteophytes, showing different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> at the level of vertebral bodies (Morgan, 1967). A recent study (Carnier et al., 2004), although conducted on a relatively small sample of Italian Boxer dogs, showed that additive genetic variation for the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> osteophytes <b>development</b> (DOD) is large enough to be exploited in specific breeding programs. The high prevalence of diseases and defects in pure dog breeds might be due to high selection intensities in genetically closed populations (Ubbink, 1998). Inbreeding affects mostly fitness traits and traits which are of qualitative inheritance but also quantitative traits (Klemetsdal, 1998). Mäki et al. (2001) reported estimates of inbreeding depression on hip and elbow dysplasia in six dog breeds in Finland, but no previous studies dealing with inbreeding depression on DOD in Boxer dogs are available. The aims of this study were to infer (co) variance component for DOD and to asses the effect of inbreeding depression on DOD in the Italian Boxer dog population. In conclusion The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> osteophytes <b>development</b> shows exploitable additive genetic variation.

The moral feelings are not indeed {{a part of our}} nature, in the sense of being hi any perceptible degree present in all of us; but this, unhappily, is a fact admitted by those who believe the most strenuously in their transcendental origin.

Travellers from many regions comment, now on the great precocity of children among savage and semi-civilized peoples, and now on the early arrest of their mental progress.

Of secondary inquiries coming under this sub-head may be named several. (a) Is this more rapid evolution and earlier arrest always unequally shown by the two sexes; or, in other words, are there in lower types proportional differences in rate and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> such as higher types show us? (b) Is there in many cases, as there appears to be in some cases, a traceable relation between the period of arrest and the period of puberty?

6000|$|In {{considering}} {{the question of}} the development of man by known natural laws, we must ever bear in mind the first principle of [...] "natural selection," [...] no less than of the general theory of evolution, that all changes of form or structure, all increase in the size of an organ or in its complexity, all greater specialization or physiological division of labour, can only be brought about, in {{as much as it is}} for the good of the being so modified. Mr. Darwin himself has taken care to impress upon us, that [...] "natural selection" [...] has no power to produce absolute perfection but only relative perfection, no power to advance any being much beyond his follow beings, but only just so much beyond them as to enable it to survive them in the struggle for existence. Still less has it any power to produce modifications which are in any degree injurious to its possessor, and Mr. Darwin frequently uses the strong expression, that a single case of this kind would be fatal to his theory. If, therefore, we find in man any characters, which all the evidence we can obtain goes to show would have been actually injurious to him on their first appearance, they could not possibly have been produced by natural selection. Neither could any specially developed organ have been so produced if it had been merely useless to him, or if its use were not proportionate to its <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> Such cases as these would prove, that some other law, or some other power, than [...] "natural selection" [...] had been at work. But if, further, we could see that these very modifications, though hurtful or useless at the time when they first appeared, became in the highest degree useful at a much later period, and are now essential to the full moral and intellectual development of human nature, we should then infer the action of mind, foreseeing the future and preparing for it, just as surely as we do, when we see the breeder set himself to work with the determination to produce a definite improvement in some cultivated plant or domestic animal. I would further remark that this enquiry is as thoroughly scientific and legitimate as that into the origin of species itself. It is an attempt to solve the inverse problem, to deduce the existence of a new power of a definite character, in order to account for facts which according to the theory of natural selection ought not to happen. Such problems are well known to science, and the search after their solution has often led to the most brilliant results. In the case of man, there are facts of the nature above alluded to, and in calling attention to them, and in inferring a cause for them, I believe that I am as strictly within the bounds of scientific investigation as I have been in any other portion of my work.|$|E
