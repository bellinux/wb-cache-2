5|$|According to the Barcoor Manuscript, {{written in}} Kannada by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barcoor {{after his return}} from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and <b>ill</b> <b>treatment</b> by the soldiers. At the camp at Jamalabad fort, Mangalorean Catholic leaders were thrown down from the fort. All Christian churches in South Canara, except the Hospet Church at Hospet and the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, were razed {{to the ground and}} all land owned by the {{captured}} Christians was taken over by Tipu and distributed among his favourites. After they were freed, all their belongings had disappeared and their deserted lands were cultivated by the Bunts.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and <b>ill</b> <b>treatment</b> by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, <b>ill</b> <b>treatment,</b> cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Godas' emissaries, Justinian detailed Cyril, {{one of the}} officers of the foederati, with 400 men, to accompany the invasion fleet and then sail on to Sardinia. Gelimer reacted to Godas' rebellion by sending the bulk of his fleet, 120 of his best vessels, and 5,000 men under his own brother Tzazon, to suppress it. The Vandal king's decision {{played a crucial role in}} the outcome of the war, for it removed from the scene the Vandal navy, the main obstacle to a Roman landing in Africa, as well as a large part of his army. Gelimer also chose to ignore the revolt in Tripolitania for the moment, as it was both a lesser threat and more remote, while his lack of manpower constrained him to await Tzazon's return from Sardinia before undertaking further campaigns. At the same time, both rulers tried to win over allies: Gelimer contacted the Visigoth king Theudis (r. 531–548) and proposed an alliance, while Justinian secured the benevolent neutrality and support of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, which had strained relations with the Vandals over the <b>ill</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Ostrogoth princess Amalafrida, the wife of Thrasamund. The Ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow the Roman invasion fleet to use the harbour of Syracuse in Sicily and establish a market for the provisioning of the Roman troops there.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this <b>ill</b> <b>treatment</b> from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E

The charges leveled publicly against the Jesuits were never brought {{in a court of}} law: no process of justice was gone through. Before he died Ricci, solemnly declared before witnesses: [...] "I say and protest that the Society of Jesus did not give any ground warranting its suppression; nor is there any right reason why I should have been put in jail." [...] Giulio Cordara, a close friend of Ricci made the following assessment: [...] "I would have judged him most competent to guide the Society on a quiet and tranquil sea. But because of his gentle nature I felt he was less equipped to be at the helm amid violent tossing waves" [...] (Pastor, History of the Popes, vol.XXXV, p. 379). He is buried in the crypt of the Gesù Church in Rome.|$|R

While the second step is needed to strengthen democratic values such as liberty, equality and tolerance that has existed within the majority, those of Indonesian Muslims...|$|R
