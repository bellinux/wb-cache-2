5|$|Due to flirtations with {{characters}} of various genders and sexuality, fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, {{as well as}} Terry Miller, {{the director of the}} Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his sexuality is invalid because his “brain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, <b>hetero</b> the next, etc.” The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s sexuality is linked to his mental disorder.|$|E
25|$|Directed ortho metalation (DoM) is an {{adaptation}} of electrophilic aromatic substitution in which electrophiles attach themselves exclusively to the ortho- position of a direct metalation group or DMG through the intermediary of an aryllithium compound. The DMG interacts with lithium through a <b>hetero</b> atom. Examples of DMG's are the methoxy group, a tertiary amine group and an amide group.|$|E
25|$|The general {{principle}} is outlined in scheme 1. An {{aromatic ring system}} with a DMG group 1 interacts with an alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium in its specific aggregation state (hence (R-Li)n) to intermediate 2 since the <b>hetero</b> atom on the DMG is a Lewis base and lithium the Lewis acid. The very basic alkyllithium then deprotonates the ring in the nearest ortho- position forming the aryllithium 3 all the while maintaining the acid-base interaction. An electrophile reacts in the next phase in an electrophilic aromatic substitution with a strong preference for the lithium ipso position replacing the lithium atom.|$|E

2500|$|Entry inhibitors (or fusion inhibitors) {{interfere}} with binding, fusion and entry of HIV-1 {{to the host}} cell by blocking one of several targets. [...] Maraviroc and enfuvirtide are the two currently available agents in this class. [...] Maraviroc works by targeting CCR5, a co-receptor located on human helper T-cells. Caution should be used when administering this drug however due to a possible shift in tropism which allows HIV to target an alternative co-receptor such as CXCR4. [...] In rare cases, individuals may have a mutation in the CCR5 delta gene which results in a nonfunctional CCR5 co-receptor and in turn, a means of resistance or slow progression of the disease. [...] However, as mentioned previously, this can be overcome if an HIV variant that targets CXCR4 becomes dominant. [...] To prevent fusion of the virus with the host membrane, enfuvirtide can be used. [...] Enfuvirtide is a peptide drug that must be injected and acts by interacting with the N-terminal heptad repeat of gp41 of HIV to form an inactive <b>hetero</b> six-helix bundle, therefore preventing infection of host cells.|$|E

In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation is taught via the <b>hetero</b> sexual magic of married couples engaged in coitus without orgasm or seminal ejaculation. Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher octaves of energy. Each successive Solar Body {{is the result of the}} saturation of transmuted sexual energy at its respective octave: first, the [...] "Christ Astral" [...] is formed by transmuting the sex energy into a second octave; second, the [...] "Christ Mind" [...] is formed by saturating, condensing or crystallizing the sexual energy into a third octave, and the causal body or [...] "Christ Will" [...] is formed by transmuting the sexual energy called [...] "Hydrogen SI-12", into a fourth octave.
