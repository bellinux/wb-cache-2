The results show a clear fatigue endurance “trough” in LOC LBE, while no such a strong temperature dependence of the fatigue endurance is observed when the steel is tested in vacuum. The fractographic observations by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that ductile microdimples are prevalent on the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum, whereas the fracture surfaces produced in LOC LBE at all the temperatures are characterized by quasi-cleavage. Interestingly, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), martensitic laths close to the fatigue crack walls or to the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum are found to have transformed into very fine equiaxed subgrains. Nevertheless, such microstructural modifications do not happen to the specimens tested in LOC LBE at 160 <b>e</b> <b>450</b> C.

40|$|International audienceThe nitroderivatives of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are potentially important photosensitisers in the atmospheric condensed phase. Here we show that the triplet state of 1 -nitronaphthalene (31 NN*) is able to directly react with phenol, causing its transformation upon irradiation of 1 NN in aqueous solution. Additional but less important processes of phenol degradation are reactions with OH and 1 O 2, both photogenerated by irradiated 1 NN. Dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were detected as main phenol transformation intermediates, likely formed by dimerisation of phenoxy radicals that would be produced upon phenol oxidation by 31 NN*. Very interestingly, irradiation with 1 NN shifted the fluorescence peaks of phenol (Ex/Em ¼ 220 e 230 / 280 e 320 nm and 250 e 275 / 280 e 320 nm, with Ex/ Em ¼ excitation and emission wavelengths) to a region that overlaps with "M-like" fulvic substances (Ex/ Em ¼ 250 e 300 / 330 e 400 nm). Moreover, at longer irradiation times a further peak appeared (Ex/ Em ¼ 300 <b>e</b> <b>450</b> / 400 <b>e</b> <b>450</b> nm), {{which is in the}} region of HULIS fluorescence.

Cell transplantation of human and mouse cells into immune compromised mice has greatly enhanced our understanding of stem cell function, regeneration, and cancer.

By contrast, large-scale cell transplantation of fluorescent blood and cancer cells into syngeneic and irradiated zebrafish has now become routine 1 – 7. However, these approaches require that donor cells are from the same strain of syngeneic zebrafish or that the recipient immune system is transiently ablated by whole body γ-irradiation two-days prior to transplantation. Irradiated recipients eventually recover their immune system by 20 days post-irradiation and kill engrafted cells 1, 2, 6, making long-term engraftment studies difficult.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influences on productive and physiologic attributes during Marandu palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) establishment, following changes in phosphorus availability in the soil through the applications of phosphate and silicate. To achieve this, a fractionated factorial 5 ² design was used, with 13 combinations for silicon and phosphorus, respectively, in mg dm- 3 : 150 and 10; 150 and 170; 150 and 330; 225 and 90; 225 and 250; 300 and 10; 300 and 170; 300 and 330; 375 and 90; 375 and 250; 450 and 10; 450 and 170 and 450 and 330, distributed according to randomized blocks, with four replications. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using samples of a Typic Haplustox (760 g kg- 1 sand, 40 g kg- 1 silt and 200 g kg- 1 clay). Wollastonite was used as the source of silicate and the sources of phosphorus were Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2, KH 2 PO 4 and NaH 2 PO 4. Marandu palisadegrass was grown during the summer and two harvests were made during the growing season. Significant interaction between phosphorus and silicate rates was found for the number of tillers and expanded green leaves, total leaf area, dry mass production of leaf laminae and culms with sheaths, and dry mass production of plant tops. Maximum responses of the analyzed variables were reached in the combination of the intermediate rates of phosphorus (170 and 250 mg dm- 3) with high rates of silicon (375 and 450 mg dm- 3). Um dos maiores problemas no estabelecimento e na manutenção de pastagens está nas concentrações extremamente baixas de fósforo disponível nos solos. Objetivou-se avaliar os atributos produtivos e fisiológicos durante o estabelecimento do capim-Marandu (Brachiaria brizantha), em seguida à alteração na disponibilidade de fósforo, por meio das aplicações de silicato e fosfato. Utilizou-se um esquema fatorial 5 ² fracionado, com as 13 combinações assim definidas, para silício e fósforo, respectivamente, em mg dm- 3 : 150 e 10; 150 e 170; 150 e 330; 225 e 90; 225 e 250; 300 e 10; 300 e 170; 300 e 330; 375 e 90; 375 <b>e</b> 250; <b>450</b> <b>e</b> 10; <b>450</b> <b>e</b> 170 <b>e</b> <b>450</b> <b>e</b> 330, as quais foram distribuídas segundo delineamento estatístico de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições.

Food additives which have already been approved are regarded as safe according to the safety evaluation methods available at the time of approval. However, consumption of them may not be a hundred percent risk free. Phosphates are allowed to be used in order to increase water holding capacity of meat products. This may lead to consumers feeling they have been cheated since water then can be added to the product, increasing the weight of it.

In contrast, mRNAs homologous to the P- 450 b oligomer were detected at low levels in control and inducer pretreated lung and testis, and at high levels in PB induced liver. No P- 450 b mRNAs were detected in these assays in RNA isolates from the kidney or from control or MC pretreated liver. Solution hybridization data indicated that the rat lung contained 9 - 12 %, and the testis, 6 - 9 %, respectively, of the levels of P- 450 b mRNA measured in the PB induced liver. Results from oligo(dT) -cellulose and poly(U) -affinity experiments indicated that the hepatic mRNAs for P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> were present predominantly in the bound, polyadenylated fraction, whereas the homologous lung and testes P- 450 b mRNAs predominated in the flow-thru fractions...|$|R
40|$|O índice de {{parasitism}}o por Anacanthorus penilabiatus foi estudado em 126 pacus jovens, Piaractus mesopotamicus (peso inicial de 95, 71 ± 24, 23 g e peso final 155, 76 ± 28, 62 g), provenientes de mesma desova, naturalmente parasitados. Os peixes foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em três tratamentos de 42 animais cada e submetidos à suplementação com zero mg, 100 mg <b>e</b> <b>450</b> mg de DL-α acetato de tocoferila/kg de ração, alimentados duas vezes ao dia, por 18 semanas. Após este período, as brânquias foram avaliadas quanto à presença do parasito e amostras de sangue coletadas. Apesar de 100 % dos pacus analisados apresentarem monogenea, não se observou diferença estatística (p > 0, 05) quanto ao índice de parasitismo entre os grupos. Todavia, os animais que receberam a vitamina E apresentaram menores contagens de parasitos nas brânquias. Da mesma forma, os peixes alimentados com baixos níveis de vitamina E não diferiram estatisticamente (p > 0, 05) dos tratados com DL-α acetato de tocoferila (100 mg/kg <b>e</b> <b>450</b> mg/kg) quanto à contagem global de eritrócitos, hematócrito e volume corpuscular médio. A suplementação alimentar com vitamina E não interferiu no desempenho produtivo de pacus The {{rates of}} Anacanthorus penilabiatus parasitism were investigated in 126 pacus, (Piaractus mesopotamicus) -with initial weight of 95. 71 ± 24. 23 g and final weight of 155. 76 ± 28. 62 g, {{from the same}} spawn and naturally infested. Fishes were randomly distributed among three groups of 42 animals each and submitted to treatment with 0, 100 and 450 mg of DL-α tocopheryl acetate/Kg of dry diet, fed twice a day during 18 weeks. The gills were evaluated {{according to the presence}} of parasites and collected blood samples. Although 100 % of pacus examined were parasited, the results did not show statistical difference (P > 0. 05) for parasite counting among the groups treated. Therefore, fish supplemented with vitamin E demonstrated lower parasites counts. In the same way, fish fed with low rates of vitamin E did not differ statistically (P > 0. 05) to erythrocyte counts, hematocrit and average corpuscular volume when compared to the pacus supplemented with 100 and 450 mg of DL-α tocopheryl acetate. Dietary supplementation with vitamin E did not affect the pacus growth rate...|$|R

40|$|Zebrafish {{have become}} a {{powerful}} tool for assessing development, regeneration, and cancer. More recently, allograft cell transplantation protocols have been developed that permit engraftment of normal and malignant cells into irradiated, syngeneic, and immune compromised adult zebrafish. These models when coupled with optimized cell transplantation protocols allow for the rapid assessment of stem cell function, regeneration following injury, and cancer. Here, we present a method for cell transplantation of zebrafish adult skeletal muscle and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), a pediatric sarcoma that shares features with embryonic muscle, into immune compromised adult rag 2 <b>E</b> <b>450</b> fs homozygous mutant zebrafish. Importantly, these animals lack T cells and have reduced B cell function, facilitating engraftment {{of a wide range of}} tissues from unrelated donor animals. Our optimized protocols show that fluorescently labeled muscle cell preparations from α-actin-RFP transgenic zebrafish engraft robustly when implanted into the dorsal musculature of rag 2 homozygous mutant fish. We also demonstrate engraftment of fluorescent-transgenic ERMS where fluorescence is confined to cells based on differentiation status. Specifically, ERM...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reports two simple {{molecular}} approaches allowing a rapid {{identification of the}} most prevalent species of phlebotomine sand flies in the Mediterranean region. A PCR protocol for the amplification of ITS 2 ribosomal region and a PCR-RFLP on a mitochondrial DNA fragment (cytb-nd 1) were settled {{in order to identify}} and discriminate among Phlebotomus perniciosus, Phlebotomus neglectus, Phlebotomus perfiliewi, Phlebotomus papatasi and Sergentomyia minuta. The ITS 2 regions showed a certain degree of interspecific variability, which led to PCR amplicons of different sizes, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>450,</b> 490, 460, 480 and 530 bp for P. perniciosus, P. neglectus, P. perfiliewi, P. papatasi, and S. minuta, respectively. Analogously, the digestion of a mitochondrial DNA amplicon with Ase I enzyme showed five different restriction profiles, which allowed the unequivocal differentiation of the sand fly species examined. These methods might represent useful tools for a molecular large scale screening of phlebotomine sand fly species caught in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic, in order to plan appropriate epidemiological surveillance programs for both Leishmania spp. and their vectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{elevated}} temperature creep {{properties of the}} 50 Au- 50 Cu wt% and 47 Au- 50 Cu- 3 Ni braze alloys have been evaluated over the temperature range 250 - 850 C. At {{elevated temperature}}s, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>450</b> - 850 C, both alloys were tested in the annealed condition (2 hrs. 750 C/water quenched). The minimum strain rate properties over this temperature range are well fit by the Garofalo sinh equation. At lower temperatures (250 and 350 C), power law equations were found to characterize the data for both alloys. For samples held {{long periods of time}} at 375 C (96 hrs.) and slowly cooled to room temperature, an ordering reaction was observed. For the case of the 50 Au- 50 Cu braze alloy, the stress necessary to reach the same, strain rate increased by about 15 % above the baseline data. The limited data for ordered 47 Au- 50 Cu- 3 Ni alloy reflected a,smaller strength increase. However, the sluggishness of this ordering reaction in both alloys does not appear to pose a problem for braze joints cooled at reasonable rates following brazing...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedAn investigation of vortex shedding downstream of {{a cascade of}} compressor stator blades, at off-design inlet-flow angles of 35, 33 and 31 degrees and Reynolds numbers, based on chord length, of 625, 000, 750, 000 and 800, 000 is reported. The objective {{of the study was}} to characterize the flow and vortex shedding through blade surface pressure measurements and hot-wire anemometry. Vortex shedding was determined to be a leading edge phenomenon as periodic shedding was only detected on the pressure side of the wake. The relationship between vortex shedding frequency and Reynolds number was nearly linear. The vortex shedding frequency at three incidence angles was observed to be quite similar at lower Reynolds number (i. <b>e.</b> <b>450,</b> 000 and below) but developed into a larger scatter at higher Reynolds number. Similarly, the Strouhal numbers were observed to be fairly consistent (0. 22 to 0. 24) at low Reynolds number and more scattered (0. 18 to 0. 25) with increasing Reynolds number. The result obtained was comparable to the experimental results obtained by Roshko[Ref. 14], for vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder. Major, Republic of Singapore Air Forc...|$|R
