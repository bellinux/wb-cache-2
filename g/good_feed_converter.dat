To relieve {{the stress of}} pollution, distributed energy sources (DES) become more and more popular, ho stochastic volatility and intermittence characteristics of D execute considerable impacts on normal operation of the power System and make the power system different from traditional one. Those DESs are connected to the power system through three-phase grid <b>feeding</b> <b>converters</b> (GFCs). The control of the three-phase Grid <b>Feeding</b> <b>Converters</b> (GFCs) is very important to the system stability and security. Proportional Integral (PI) based control strategy is conventionally applied to control the output power or current of a grid <b>feeding</b> <b>converter.</b> However, the tuning process of PI-based controller is complex and time consuming. This paper introduces the Differential Evaluation (DE) algorithm to optimize the PI controller parameters. The uncertainty and disturbance are included during the modeling of GFC system to truly reflect the characteristics of the practical environment. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed DE method to optimize the PI controller parameters...|$|R

The proposed technique, which employs a current <b>feed</b> <b>converter</b> for <b>feeding</b> the utility grid through an unidirectional full bridge inverter, may be considered an alternative to a traditional voltage feed inverters...|$|R
40|$|For their {{reliability}} and relatively low production costs, three-phase induction machines are widely utilized in {{variable speed drives}} as drive units. The stator is fed from a solid-state frequency converter. At operation of these drive systems however, some part of <b>feeding</b> <b>converter</b> can fail, e. g. one of its legs. In order that the drive can be kept in operation in some cases, the converter is reconfigured...|$|R
40|$|Fry of Heterobranchus bidorsalis (mean weight, 0. 03 g) {{were fed}} at 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 % {{of their body}} weight (bw) /day in outdoor {{concrete}} tanks in New Bussa, Nigeria. The fry attained the highest average weight of 6. 66 g in 10 weeks when fed at 40 % bw/day. Feed conversion ratio ranged from 2. 13 to 9. 65, the protein efficiency ratio from 1. 33 to 5. 93. Results indicated that H. bidorsalis are efficient <b>feed</b> <b>converters.</b> <b>Feed</b> intake was significantly different (p< 0. 05) between the treatments, specific growth rate (SGR), daily growth rate (DGR), production and average weight gain indicated that 40 % of fish biomass was the optimum feeding leve...|$|R
