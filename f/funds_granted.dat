5|$|The San Antonio Express {{reported}} in 1939 that the <b>funds</b> <b>granted</b> to the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health {{would be used}} to establish mental hygiene clinics and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for mental health research, and to survey mental hygiene conditions in Texas. On the entry of the United States into World War II, the Foundation researched methods to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing mental health care to the poor and the aged. The Foundation continues to award five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a Master's degree in Social Work.|$|E

On November 4, two days after Scott Walker won the gubernatorial election, however, Doyle ordered work on the line to be temporarily halted, and on November 9 said that he planned to leave the choice of whether or not to operate the train to Walker.|$|E
25|$|But {{these efforts}} {{have not been}} as {{successful}} as hoped. Out of necessity most of the fleet, 330 standard bus equivalents out of 506, were replaced {{in just two years}} in 1985-6. (Standard bus equivalents factor the 30-foot and 60-foot into their equivalent capacity in 40-foot buses). And seven years passed without any new buses coming on board before Muni started its next full diesel fleet replacement cycle in 1999. This was fourteen years after the previous cycle instead of the twelve years that buses are designed to last. Muni is now aware that they must expect to keep diesel buses past their design life and have also found that <b>funds</b> <b>granted</b> for mid-life rebuilds require that the buses be kept longer still. As the fleet replacement cycle begins again in 2013, Muni has arranged for life-extending rebuilds of 142 buses, by count over 30% of the fleet.|$|E

The Asociacion de Madres de Plaza de Mayo (The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association) on the other hand, is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation.

2500|$|There {{never was}} any real hope of staging a County Championship, {{even on a}} limited basis, {{although}} Lancashire did propose a regionalised competition to include the minor counties. The idea was that home-based servicemen and those in reserved occupations would play when time allowed, {{but it was not}} realistic and MCC declined to take it forward. This was in early 1940, during the so-called [...] "Phoney War" [...] but Lancashire's Old Trafford was subsequently bombed and the club effectively closed for the duration, directing all members' subscriptions into a war relief fund. Other county clubs closed at the outset and appealed to the members to keep paying their subscriptions as a future investment. This policy had varying success with Yorkshire declaring an increased surplus and Worcestershire, for example, only a slight improvement while Leicestershire needed <b>funds</b> <b>granted</b> by Sir Julien Cahn to keep going.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Francisco died in 1831; after him, {{the next}} {{recorded}} tenant of Locust Grove was one Robert Rives, who owned {{it for a}} brief time in 1845. [...] From him it passed on to John S. Coleman, who lived there until 1906. [...] Abner Spencer then took ownership, living there until sometime after 1932. [...] The Society of the Descendants of Peter Francisco took charge of the land beginning in the early 1970s, leasing it from its owners at the rate of one dollar a year. [...] The intent was to restore the house {{and turn it into a}} museum and shrine dedicated to Francisco's memory; while the restoration was completed, due in part to matching <b>funds</b> <b>granted</b> by the United States government upon conferral of the National Register listing, the museum was never created, and the house reverted to private ownership. [...] Today Locust Grove is owned by a couple from Richmond who use it as a second home.|$|E
