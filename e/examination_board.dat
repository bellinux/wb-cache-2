5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an <b>examination</b> <b>board</b> that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

30|$|In {{one such}} study, (Alderson and Buck 1993, see also Alderson et al., 1995) {{examined}} the testing {{practices of the}} EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> in the UK context. The purpose of their {{study was to examine}} what standards were maintained by the EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> in the UK, to what extent all EFL/ESL examining authorities followed the same or similar procedures, and whether procedures could be improved. Their study was divided into two phases. In the first phase, a letter was sent to the EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards,</b> asking three broad questions in relation to the standards to which EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> followed, and the procedures that they followed to estimate test reliability and to ensure test validity. During {{the second phase of the}} study, the two researchers used a structured questionnaire to investigate the testing practices of 12 EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards,</b> touching upon such areas as test syllabus, test construction, validation, administration, marking, reports and post hoc analyses, and test revision. Their study concluded that there was no common agreed set of standards that these EFL/ESL <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> maintained, and different <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> did different things, with different degrees of rigor, to monitor the quality of their examinations. The two researchers therefore further concluded that time was ripe for UK <b>examination</b> <b>boards</b> and UK language testers to develop a set of standards all EFL/ESL tests should follow.|$|R

25|$|Standardized {{testing has}} been a part of American {{education}} since the 1800s, but the widespread reliance on standardized is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. For instance the College Entrance <b>Examination</b> <b>Board</b> did not begin standardized testing in connection to higher education until 1900. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to standardize curriculum. With origins in World War I the Army Alpha and Beta tests developed by Robert Yerkes and colleagues. Before then, immigration in the mid-19th century contributed to the growth of standardized tests in the United States. Standardized tests were used in immigration when people first came over to test social roles and find social power and status.|$|E

After passing the examination, the college of medicine of Guatemala, Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala and the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala grants the candidate a special license to practice anaesthesia as well as a diploma issued by the Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala granting the degree of physician with specialization in anaesthesia.

25|$|Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta {{tests for}} {{soldiers}} in World War I, mental testing became {{popular in the}} US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the College Entrance <b>Examination</b> <b>Board</b> created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions. The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis. Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded. In the United States, {{tens of thousands of}} men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case Buck v. Bell.|$|E
25|$|With three {{separate}} {{organizations in the}} confined waters of the lower Mississippi, the fleet command situation was already bad enough, but it began to deteriorate further when the buildup of Farragut's fleet in the lower river became apparent. Flag Officer Hollins was at this time near Memphis, which represented the then-northernmost holdings of the Confederacy on the river, and the Confederate War Department insisted that no effort should be spared to maintain possession. Hollins was sure that the threat from the Gulf was much more severe than Richmond thought, so {{he was prepared to}} listen when General Lovell pleaded for him to come down to New Orleans to help in its defense. When there, he sent a telegram to Richmond seeking permission to attack Farragut's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar. His pleas were so insistent that they virtually amounted to insubordination. Hollins was called to Richmond, ostensibly to serve on an <b>examination</b> <b>board,</b> but in effect to be removed from active service. By default, command of the Confederate Navy vessels in the vicinity of New Orleans fell on the shoulders of Commander William C. Whittle, up to that time commandant of the navy yard there. Whittle did not consider himself able to handle all of his new duties, so on April 18 he passed command of CSS McRae, Jackson, and Manassas, together with their support vessels, to his executive officer, Commander John K. Mitchell. These were all the Confederate Naval vessels afloat at the time; Louisiana and Mississippi had not yet been launched, and were explicitly not controlled by Whittle or Mitchell. Later, when Louisiana was launched but before she was completed, she joined the others in Mitchell's domain.|$|E
