5|$|Manstein favoured an {{immediate}} pincer {{attack on the}} Kursk salient after the battle at Kharkov, but Hitler was concerned that such a plan would draw forces away from the industrial region in the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin.</b> In any event, the ground was still too muddy to move the tanks into position. In lieu of {{an immediate}} attack, the OKH prepared Operation Citadel, the launching {{of which would be}} delayed while more troops were gathered in the area and the mud solidified. Meanwhile, the Red Army, well aware of the danger of encirclement, also moved in large numbers of reinforcements, and their intelligence reports revealed the expected locations and timing of the German thrusts.|$|E
5|$|The German {{offensive}} against the Soviet Union began early on 22 June 1941 with an artillery barrage. The 16th Panzer Division was subordinated to Heeresgruppe Süd (Army Group South) {{under the command}} of Generalfeldmarschall Von Rundstedt. The goal, together with the 6. Armee and 17. Armee as well as Panzergruppe I, was to follow the pincers of both armies, heading for Kiev and rolling up the Soviet flanks in the process, and finally encircling them at the Dnieper River. The main objective was to conquer the economically important <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> as well as the oil field in the Caucasus.|$|E

25|$|Donetsk and the {{surrounding}} territories are heavily urbanised and agglomerated into conurbation. The workforce is heavily involved with heavy industry, especially coal mining. The city is an important center of heavy industry and coal mines in the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> (Donbass) and Ukraine. Directly under the city lie coal mines, which have recently seen an increase in mining accidents, the most recent accident being at the Zasyadko mine, which killed over 100 workers.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} information on the investigations of carbon isotopic ratios in coal, chemical content, and carbon isotopic characteristics {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane in coalbed gases of the Carboniferous beds of the A. F. Zasyadko coal mine (Donbas). It is established that the coalbed gases originated from kerogen- 3 due to its thermal degradation. Extrinsic methane and carbon dioxide in some coalbed gases were detected. Probably, they were migrated from deeper levels of the <b>Donets</b> coal <b>basin</b> and (or) an endogenic source...|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Russian Empire {{captured}} large uninhabited steppe territories {{from the}} former Crimean Khanate. The systematic colonization of lands in what became known as Novorossiya (mainly Crimea, Taurida and around Odessa) began. Migrants from many ethnic groups (predominantly Ukrainians and Russians from Russia proper) came to this area. At the same time the discovery of coal in the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> also marked the commencement of a large-scale industrialization and an influx of workers {{from other parts of the}} Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|According to July 2012 polling by RATING 50% of the {{surveyed}} adult residents over 18 {{years of}} age considered their native language to be Ukrainian, 29% said Russian, 20% identified both Russian and Ukrainian as their native language, 1% gave another language. 5% could not decide which language is their native one. Almost 80% of respondents stated {{they did not have}} any problems using their native language in 2011. 8% stated they had experienced difficulty in the execution (understanding) of official documents; mostly middle-aged and elderly people in South Ukraine and the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{educational}} institutions' Ukrainization varies {{in the different}} regions of Ukraine. In the 16 western oblasts (provinces) of Ukraine there are 26 Russian language schools out of 12,907 and in Kiev 6 out of 452 schools use Russian as their primary language of instruction, (according to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kievans, as 52% use Russian and 24% switch between both). In the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> region {{the percentage of students}} receiving education in Russian roughly corresponds to the percentage of population who considers Russian as their native language and in Crimea the overwhelming majority of secondary schools students are taught in Russian. The distribution is similar in the institutes of the higher education while the latter are somewhat more Ukrainianized.|$|E
50|$|Coal mining in Ukraine {{is often}} being {{associated}} with the <b>Donets</b> Black Coal <b>Basin</b> in the eastern Ukraine, {{but there are some}} other located throughout the country. Ukraine has a well developed mining industry of bituminous coal (black or rock coal), anthracite, lignite (brown coal) as well as peat.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{consolidated}} {{the core}} of Russia under his rule, Ivan III became the first Moscow ruler to adopt the titles of tsar and [...] "Ruler of all Rus'". Ivan competed with his powerful northwestern rival, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, for control {{over some of the}} semi-independent former principalities of Kievan Rus' in the upper Dnieper and <b>Donets</b> river <b>basins.</b> Through the defections of some princes, border skirmishes, and a long, inconclusive war with Lithuania that ended only in 1503, Ivan III was able to push westward, and the Moscow state tripled in size under his rule.|$|R
40|$|Ukraine is {{very rich}} in mineral resources. It {{contains}} iron and manganese ores, natural gas, salt, sulphur, graphite, flux limestone. Ukraine also has deposits of oil, bauxite {{as well as}} black coal. Mineral resources can be classified into three main groups: fuels, metals and nonmetals. Fuels include deposits of black and brown coal, natural gas and peat. The reserves of black coal are concentrated in two basins: the <b>Donets</b> and Lviv-Volynian <b>Basins,</b> deposits of brown coal {{are to be found}} in many places on the Right Bank. They form the large Dnieper Brown Coal Basin. The western regions of Ukraine contain small deposits of brown coal. Brown coal is used as local fuel for power stations, factories and plants, also in household heating...|$|R
25|$|Polyakov pioneered {{fast-track}} railroad construction schedules, introducing {{new standards}} of project management promoted by his new {{ally in the}} government, minister Pavel Melnikov. Kursk-Kharkiv-Azov mainline (780 verst, commissioned in two stages in July and December 1869) was built in a record time of 22 months; it provided the first reliable rail link for <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> coal mines where Polyakov had substantial interests. He also acquired a concession to build a steel foundry in Azov, but eventually preferred to sell the rights to John Hughes. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) Polyakov was commissioned to build two frontline railroads, Bendery-Galaţi and Frăteşti-Zimnica. Actual construction was managed by Mikhail Danilov. The speed of building these railroads earned Polyakov a medal of the Paris World Exhibition of 1878 and over 20 million roubles from the government, including a 4.5 million time bonus.|$|E
25|$|In the upstream, above Belgorod, {{the river}} {{contains}} several dams and small reservoirs. In the downstream, after {{the confluence of}} the Wolf River (Volchiya River), there is Pechenihy Reservoir (volume 86km3) which supplies water to the city of Kiev. Below Pechenga Reservoir, Donets is fed by Udy and by its largest tributary Oskol. There the valley widens and contains numerous oxbow lakes in its floodplain. Within Ukraine, the river flows between the Cisdesna plateau and the Donets lowland. In its middle, the river is partly fed by the Dnieper River waters which are brought though the Dnieper–Donbas–Seversky Donets channels which provide water to the coal industry of the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin,</b> usually called the Donbass. Near the Russian city of Donetsk (Rostov oblast), the river crosses the Donets Ridge and flows in a narrow valley with steep and rocky slopes. In the lower part of Donets lowland, the flow is interrupted by sluices and is slow. At the delta it splits into three distributaries.|$|E
25|$|Industrialization in the 19th century shifted {{interests}} to mineral exploitation in Donbas, with water-hungry plants concentrated mostly in Kiev, Luhansk and Donetsk. Already by the 1930s, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk were lacking water forcing {{the authorities to}} gradually create a network of canals and reservoirs. In 1936, the Kochetok Reservoir was created and coupled to the water system of Kharkiv. By the 1950s, this measure proved insufficient, and in the 1960s, Pechenga Reservoir was constructed {{in place of the}} Kochetok Reservoir. It has with the capacity of 400 million m3 and provides about 75% of water consumed by Kharkiv. To supply water to southern Donbas and Donetsk, the 130-km long Donets-Donbass channel was built around 1958 starting near Raigorodok city, and in compensation, the Dnieper-Donbass channel was created to supply water from Dnieper River to the upstream of the Donets via the Bereka River. As a result of the industrial activity, the wild nature of <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> transformed into an industrial settlement. After the breakup of the USSR, most of the basin territory became part of Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Smolensk {{was another}} severe defeat for the Red Army {{in the opening}} phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to {{implement}} a coordinated counter-attack against {{a large part of}} the front; although the counter-attack was almost entirely a failure, the increasing resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the Blitzkrieg towards Moscow was not going to be an easy undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, Franz Halder and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as Ukraine, the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> and the Caucasus, with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Uman. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.|$|E
25|$|According to polling by RATING {{the level}} of support for {{granting}} Russian {{the status of a}} state language decreased (from 54% to 46%) and the number of opponents increased (from 40% to 45%) between 2009 and May 2012; in July 2012 41% of respondents supported granting Russian the status of a state language and 51% opposed it. (In July 2012) among the biggest supporters of bilingualism were residents of the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> (85%), South Ukraine (72%) and East Ukraine (50%). A further poll conducted by RATING in September–October 2012 found 51% opposed granting official status to the Russian language, whereas 41% supported it. The largest regions of support were Donbass (75%), southern (72%) and eastern (53%), whereas nearly 70% of northern and central Ukraine, and 90% of western Ukraine were in opposition. A survey conducted in February 2015 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that support for Russian as a state language had dropped to 19% (37% in the south, 31% in Donbass and other eastern oblasts). 52% (West: 44%, Central: 57%; South: 43%; East: 61%) said that Russian should be official only in regions where the majority wanted it and 21% said it should be removed from official use.|$|E
500|$|Donbass ( [...] ; [...] ), or the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin,</b> is {{a region}} that is today {{composed}} of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine. Previously known for being [...] "Wild Fields" [...] ( [...] , dyke pole), the area that is now called the Donbass was largely under control of the Ukrainian Cossack Hetmanate and the Turkic Crimean Khanate until the mid-late 18th century, when the Russian Empire conquered the Hetmanate and annexed the Khanate. It named the conquered territories [...] "New Russia" [...] ( [...] , Novorossiya). As the Industrial Revolution took hold across Europe, the vast coal resources of the Donbass began to be exploited in the mid-late 19th century. This led to a population boom in the region, largely driven by Russian settlers. In 1858, {{the population of the}} region was 700,767. By 1897, it had reached 1,453,109. According to the Russian Imperial Census of 1897, ethnic Ukrainians comprised 52.4% of the population of region, whilst ethnic Russians comprised 28.7%. Ethnic Greeks, Germans, Jews and Tatars also had a significant presence in the Donbass, particularly in the district of Mariupol, where they comprised 36.7% of the population. Despite this, Russians constituted the majority of the industrial work-force. Ukrainians dominated rural areas, but cities were often inhabited solely by Russians who had come seeking work in the region's heavy industries. Those ethnic Ukrainians who did move to the cities for work were quickly assimilated into the Russian-speaking worker class.|$|E

The Donets is the fourth longest river in Ukraine and the biggest in the Eastern Ukraine. It is an important source of fresh water in the east of the country. It gives its name to the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin,</b> known commonly as the Donbass, an important coal mining region in Ukraine.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets and Romanians {{completed}} the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944. The {{battle for the}} city turned into the Siege of Budapest. During the fight, most of {{what remained of the}} Hungarian First Army was destroyed about [...] north of Budapest in a running battle from 1 January to 16 February 1945. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the Miklós provisional government signed an armistice in Moscow. In January 1945, 32,000 ethnic Germans from within Hungary were arrested and transported to the Soviet Union as forced laborers. In some villages, the entire adult population were taken to labor camps in the <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin.</b> Many died there as a result of hardships and ill-treatment. Overall, between 100,000 and 170,000 Hungarian ethnic Germans were transported to the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Lvov's {{architecture}} {{represented the}} second, [...] "strict" [...] generation of neoclassicism stylistically close to Giacomo Quarenghi. Lvov worked in Saint Petersburg but his best works survived in the countryside, especially his native Tver Governorate. He redesigned the external appearance of Peter and Paul Fortress and created an unprecedented Trinity Church combining a Roman rotunda with one-of-a-kind pyramidal bell tower. He adapted rammed earth {{technology to the}} environment of Northern Russia and used it in his extant Priory Palace in Gatchina; Lvov's construction school, established in 1797, trained over 800 craftsmen. He managed geological surveys and published a treatise on the coals from <b>Donets</b> <b>Basin</b> and Moscow Basin. He experimented with coal pyrolysis, proposed new uses for coal tar and sulphur, and wrote a reference book on heating and ventilation.|$|E
2500|$|The club Shakhtar was {{originally}} formed in May 1936 and was initially named Stakhanovets, meaning [...] "the participant of Stakhanovite movement," [...] which derived from Aleksei Stakhanov, a coal-miner in the <b>Donets</b> <b>basin</b> and propaganda celebrity in 1935. The first team {{was based upon}} two other local teams, the participants of the All-Ukrainian Spartakiads: Dynamo Horlivka and Dynamo Stalino. The first game was unofficial against Dynamo Odessa and took place on 12 May 1936 at Balitsky Stadium in Horlivka. The team lost it 3–2 after scoring the first goal. Its first official game with Dynamo Kazan was even more disappointing, which they lost 4–1. Nonetheless, the selective job conducted constructively by the clubs administration allowed the club to compete successfully at the top level {{by the end of}} the 1930s. During the war championship of 1941, which was interrupted unexpectedly, the club defeated Soviet champions Dynamo Moscow and after about ten games were placed in fifth in the league.
