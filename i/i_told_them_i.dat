Killswitch Engage made sure to have written in their {{contract}} with Roadrunner that D'Antonio would produce all of the band's artwork. D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover. Something with texture that appeared like it was just laid down and photographed. I remember Roadrunner hating the cover, saying {{there was too much}} going on and nothing to focus on. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> did not agree, and that some day they would get it." ...|$|E

Moore, who {{had been living in}} Costa Rica, stayed with him for two weeks, then decided to settle in Istanbul and record the third Chroma Key album there. Moore signed to InsideOut Records. [...] "They've been really great {{supporting}} this; they sent me out to Turkey when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> wanted to record out there, basically supporting the whole process," [...] he said. The first project Moore worked on after he moved to Istanbul was Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the Turkish film Okul. Moore enjoyed the experience and decided to write the third Chroma Key album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E

Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool. According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution...

The booklet's photographs were taken in {{one day at a}} pub opposite the 4AD offices, because, according to Larbalestier, [...] "it {{was one of the few}} places that had a raised stage". In an 1988 interview with Joy Press, Black Francis described the concept as referring to [...] "a surfer girl," [...] who [...] "walks along the Beach of Binones, has a surfboard, very beautiful." [...] When questioned about the topless element, he replied, [...] "For the first record, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> liked nudity. I like body lines—not necessarily something in bad taste, didn't even have to be female, just body lines... like that Obsession ad, you know?" [...] According to Melody Maker, the album was originally entitled [...] "Gigantic" [...] after Deal's song, but the band feared misinterpretation of the cover and changed it to [...] "Surfer Rosa." [...] The [...] "name" [...] of the cover woman, and the album title, comes from the [...] "Oh My Golly!" [...] lyric, [...] "Besando chichando con surfer rosa." ...|$|E

Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E

Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ... This new version ... is, quite simply, a better film ... Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Balachander and {{his unit}} could not trace Sulakshana who {{disappeared}} from the film scene 12 years ago. So they decided to kill Bhairavi's character and keep her as a photograph in the serial. As it transpired, Sulakshana {{found out about the}} sequel from the newspapers and contacted Balachander. To his delight, she told him she would play Bhairavi. [...] "They were so happy to see me," [...] she said. [...] "The script was rewritten and Bhairavi was alive again. I am happy to act as Bhairavi. She is still the same soft person. The only difference is she is older and the mother of two children. There is more understanding between JKB and Bhairavi now -- she doesn't fight with him". Carnatic singer Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, who has never acted before, will play Sindhu. When contacted by Minbimangal, a surprised Anuradha was reluctant to accept the offer. [...] "My initial reaction was I am not interested in acting. I am a professional singer. I had absolutely no plans to act. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> needed time to think. It was my husband's gentle persuasion that made me meet K Balachander. Once I met him, I was struck by his simplicity. When he told me they would see to it that my kacheris (concerts) would not get affected because of the shooting, I said yes". [...] "That Suhasini acted in the original film does not bother me at all," [...] she says. [...] "I am a student as far as acting is concerned. My only concern is I shouldn't disappoint Balachander". Rajhesh Vaidhya, who is composing the songs for the serial, faces a tough challenge; the songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja for the film are considered masterpieces.

2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
