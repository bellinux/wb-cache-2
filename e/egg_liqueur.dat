On 5 May, a crowd of 5,000 people turned up at Youngstorget to listen to Lange and his Danish counterpart Mogens Glistrup. On his first appearance in a political television debate, Lange showed up {{with a bottle of}} <b>egg</b> <b>liqueur</b> and a Viking sword he had received from Geirr Tveitt, and his appearance in the debate became a success. Lange was not a big drinker, but he used <b>egg</b> <b>liqueur</b> during speeches to clear his throat. His use of the drink nonetheless led sales of Advocaat to soar. Lange finally entered the Norwegian Parliament after the 1973 parliamentary election, together with three other representatives from his party. Lange set a record of speeches during his first year in parliament, speaking more than any other representative. He was elected into the Consumer and Administration Committee, which he dismissed as a redundant entity. During his time in parliament he came on good terms with politicians from all parties. Lange said he only felt hostility from Kåre Willoch, leader of the Conservative Party, whose presence he considered to [...] "fill the room with hate;" [...] Willoch had expressed little respect for Lange before the 1973 election, labeling him as a [...] "mad-man" [...] and agitator without visions.|$|E

30|$|The EU {{reference}} method states some specifications for the distillation, which include that the apparatus must be leak-tight, the regularisation of the distillation rate must be possible, a rapid and complete condensation of the alcohol vapours must occur, {{and the first}} distillation fractions must be collected in an aqueous medium. As example, the EU {{reference method}} provides a classical distillation apparatus consisting of a 20 -cm Vigreux rectifying column, a 10 -cm straight-rimmed West condenser (a variant of a Liebig condenser), and a 40 -cm cooling coil (European Commission 2000). However, other suitable distillation devices may be applied, e.g. such as specified by IUPAC (1968). The only method performance requirement for the distillation apparatus is that the distillation of 200  mL of a water-alcohol solution with known concentration close to 50  % vol must not cause a loss of alcohol of more than 0.1  % vol (European Commission 2000). The classical distillation is comparably time-consuming, difficult to automate and problematic for some samples (such as liqueurs) that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For these reasons, our group has introduced the use of automatic steam distillation for the purpose in 2003 (Lachenmeier et al. 2003) [English summary version published in 2004 (Lachenmeier 2004)]. Using optimised settings of the steam-distillation device, the method had a wide application range for alcoholic beverages between 2 and 80  % vol with identical results to classical distillation. In follow-up studies, we have shown the applicability for complex matrices such as <b>egg</b> <b>liqueurs</b> (Lachenmeier et al. 2005), alcohol powders (Bauer-Christoph and Lachenmeier 2005) or cherry-spirit containing cakes (Lachenmeier et al. 2007).|$|R
5000|$|With ranches and charreadas an {{important}} part of Villa de Carbón's history and culture, crafts related to these, especially leather-making and leather products. Principal goods made are boots, leather jackets, hats and other items related to the needs of horsemen. Crafts-production employs significant percentage of the municipality's residents. The most important item produced here is called [...] "botines," [...] which is a kind of ankle-high boot associated with charreada. Villa del Carbón {{is one of the last}} locations in Mexico to be a significant producer of this footwear and they are exported to many locations in the country. Another craft practiced here is the making of knit items such as scarves, ponchos, wraps, sweaters,etc. These are mostly available at the tianguis (temporary market) that pops up on weekends at Plaza Hidalgo in the town center. Lastly, the town also has a number of [...] "rompope" [...] (a sweet <b>egg</b> <b>liqueur)</b> producers. Rompope was brought to Mexico by Spanish friars and its production here originated with the monasteries they established. Over time, however, its production fell into secular hands.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of sample volume may derive {{from a larger}} volume error at smaller volumes, rather than problems in the distillation itself. It is suggested to use volumes of more than 10  mL. This confirms our previous results on <b>egg</b> <b>liqueur,</b> which showed inacceptable precision if only 5 or 10  g of sample were used (Lachenmeier et al. 2005). While we found no significant differences for a volume of 200  mL, we believe that such high volumes should not be used, because especially for spirits and liqueurs with higher alcoholic strengths, the distillation time may {{not be sufficient to}} recover the complete amount of alcohol. For the same reason, we suggest to use a larger receiver volume than the original sample volume. The error increase due to dilution appears to be compensated by the more complete distillation.|$|E
