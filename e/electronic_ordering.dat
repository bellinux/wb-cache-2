40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{electronic}} marketplaces, we consider a single-product make-tostock manufacturing system that uses two alternative selling channels: long-term contracts and a spot market of <b>electronic</b> <b>orders.</b> At time 0, the risk-averse manufacturer selects the long-term contract price, {{at which point}} buyers choose {{one of the two}} channels. The resulting long-term contract demand is a deterministic fluid, while the spot-market price is modeled as a geometric regulated Brownian motion that is correlated with the spot-market demand process. The manufacturer accepts or rejects each <b>electronic</b> <b>order,</b> and long-term contracts and accepted <b>electronic</b> <b>orders</b> are backordered if necessary. The manufacturer’s control problem is to select the optimal long-term contract price as well as the optimal production (i. e., busy/idle) and electronic-order admission policies to maximize revenue minus inventory holding and backorder costs. Under heavy traffic conditions, the problem is approximated by a diffusion control problem, and analytical approximations are used to derive a policy that is simple, and reasonably accurate and robust. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} the top 326 U.

Quick-service chains, most notably those selling pizza, and fast-casual chains are far ahead of other segments in adopting <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering,</b> particularly using online approaches. Mobile apps are less common, although their use is growing. Although order-placing functionality is limited for mobile apps, the fast-casual chains are leading the way in allowing customers to place orders. Nearly all restaurant chains have a Facebook presence, but just 3 percent allowed ordering through that channel. The advantages of <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> include increased sales, particularly through automatic upselling and by storing order information so that customers are encouraged to repeat their previous orders with a single click. Other than the cost of installation and operation, the chief disadvantage of <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> is the potential for amplifying rush time volume, with the potential of overwhelming the kitchen.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> {{systems have}} the {{potential}} to enhance the efficient utilisation of pathology services. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of electronic pathology ordering on repeat test ordering for paediatric patients (ages 0 to 18 years) who were in intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICU wards. The dataset described 85, 728 pathology tests ordered for 5, 073 children before and after the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering.</b> This study showed that, for children in ICUs, the repeat test order rate was significantly lower for electronic orders than for paper-based orders. Similarly, the rate of repeat tests ordered within short intervals (up to 23 -hours), for children older than one-year in non-ICU wards, was lower for <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> than for paper ordering. The proportion of repeat tests occurring within one-hour of the previous test was consistently lower for tests ordered using <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> than it was for tests ordered using the paper based system for patients older than one-year in all wards and for patients under one-year in ICUs. These results suggest that features of the electronic system, including alerts about previously ordered tests and the availability of information about previous orders, can help clinicians to identify and reduce unnecessary repeat tests. 6 page(s...|$|E

The chief reason for <b>electronic</b> <b>ordering</b> given by those have ordered (users) is that they gain convenience and control. The major factor that inhibits {{those who have not}} ordered via an electronic channel (non-users) is a desire for interaction (although technology anxiety is also a factor).
