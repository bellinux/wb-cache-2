25|$|Silica can {{be drawn}} into fibers at {{reasonably}} high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of {{the ends of the}} fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).|$|E
25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E

500|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by crustal shortening and thickening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the Simply Folded Belt, which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sequence of sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprises a basal Cambrian conglomerate beneath a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to late Cretaceous age, known together as the [...] "Competent Group" [...] owing to their relatively <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength,</b> overlain by a sequence of weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to early Miocene age, topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, which means that folds at different stratigraphic levels may have different locations, orientations, or wavelengths. Measurements of earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E

2500|$|Biaxially {{oriented}} PET film (often {{known by}} one of its trade names, [...] "Mylar") can be aluminized by evaporating a thin film of metal onto it to reduce its permeability, {{and to make it}} reflective and opaque (MPET). These properties are useful in many applications, including flexible food packaging and thermal insulation (such as space blankets). Because of its <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength,</b> PET film is often used in tape applications, such as the carrier for magnetic tape or backing for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fixed bed}} of {{carbonaceous}} fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) {{through which the}} [...] "gasification agent" [...] (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration. The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> and must ideally be non-caking {{so that it will}} form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} role {{of cellulose}} in cell walls has been likened {{to that of}} the glass strands of fiberglass or to the supporting rods within reinforced concrete. Cellulose fibrils are highly insoluble and inelastic and, because of their molecular configuration, have a tensile strength comparable to that of steel. Consequently, cellulose imparts a unique combination of chemical resilience and mechanical support and flexibility to the tissues in which it resides. [...] Bacterial cellulose, produced by Acetobacter species, displays unique properties, including <b>high</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength,</b> high water absorption capacity, high crystallinity, and an ultra-fine and highly pure fiber network structure. One of the most important features of bacterial cellulose is its chemical purity. In addition to this, bacterial cellulose is stable towards chemicals and at high temperatures. Bacterial cellulose has been suggested to have a construction like a ‘cage' which protects the cell from foreign material and heavy-metal ions, while still allowing nutrients to be supplied easily by diffusion. Bacterial cellulose was described by Louis Pasteur as [...] "a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous and slippery." [...] Although the solid portion in the gel is less than one percent, it is almost pure cellulose containing no lignin and other foreign substances. Although bacterial cellulose is obtained {{in the form of a}} highly swollen gel, the texture is quite unique and different from typical gels. [...] Cellulose has a high swollen fiber network resulting from the presence of pore structures and tunnels within the wet pellicle. Plant cellulose water retention values 60%, while bacterial cellulose has a water retention value of 1000%.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{accounting}} for realistic interparticle interaction energy of fine dry nanoparticles, an off-lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach {{is used to}} gain insight into such properties of agglomerates of nanoparticles with primary sizes ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. This novel numerical approach allows for assessment of the mechanical properties and morphological features of the agglomerates. An interesting outcome is that the fractal dimension depends on the material properties represented via interaction energy. The agglomerate porosity increases with increasing agglomerate mass and may approach unity. With increasing Hamaker constant and fixed particle size, the agglomerates are characterized by a lower fractal dimension, higher packing porosity, <b>higher</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength,</b> larger agglomeration size, and lower crystalline fraction. For a fixed Hamaker constant, agglomerates of the smaller primary particles exhibit a more compact packing structure, <b>higher</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength,</b> smaller agglomerate size, and higher crystalline fraction. The local structure analysis indicates that for a fixed Hamaker constant, there are more particles in crystalline structure within the agglomerates constituted by the smaller primary particles. Likewise, for a fixed primary particle size, a lower Hamaker constant allows particles to configure into more stable agglomerate structures, thus providing useful insights into agglomerate morphology...|$|R
