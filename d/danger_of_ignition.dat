Bald and John Buddle share the credit for being the first to direct attention to the dangerous, highly flammable nature of coal dust. Bald pointed out the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ignition</b> <b>of</b> coal dust in a paper in Jameson's Journal, 1828.

Leakage, after bullet penetration or debris impact, can be significantly reduced by introducing polymeric materials with self-healing capabilities for the container’s walls, while an internal aluminium filler can reduce the sloshing and the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>ignition.</b> In the present paper, an experimental evaluation of the proposed solution is presented. A ballistic test campaign on a fluid container was performed to investigate the interaction between an ethylene–methacrylic acid (EMAA) -based ionomeric wall (i. e.

Results show that the presence of the fluid increases the self-healing capabilities, which are however slightly affected by the internal aluminium filler; the contribution in terms of sloshing reduction remains relevant. Moreover, additional configurations based on multilayer panels are presented. The authors studied the healing process of EMAA in a sandwich configuration made of one skin of ionomer and one skin of carbon fibre, sepa- rated by an aramidic honeycomb. The main objective of the honeycomb is to prevent the remarkable reduction of the healing capabilities observed when ionomer is directly coupled to aramidic fabric or composite panels.

Among them, we report the action oriented to “Better prevention, surveillance and crisis preparedness” because prevention and control are keywords of the present study. In detail, this article proposes an algorithm (CHECK) and a supporting database to control the diffusion of animal diseases. The working procedure we imagine works as follows. Downstream of the outbreak of cases of livestock disease, the farms which might be infected are detected by running the CHECK algorithm. Then a campaign of veterinary visits restricted to those farms has to be started and when the circumstances would demand it, {{it will be necessary}} to have recourse to specific studies suitable to identify which farms are to be culled in order to ward off the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ignition</b> <b>of</b> a real health emergency.

In the paper we will clarify why the results returned by the method we are going to propose are highly reliable and, hence, they are suitable as input data to the existing culling strategies. Given the relevance of the organization of the supporting database, as the preliminary step to reach an effective and efficient solution to the problem of the management of situations of crisis, in the present paper we will discuss and compare alternative solutions all feasible with the software products today available.

40|$|Ethylene oxide (EtO) is {{an organic}} compound, {{which is used}} as {{starting}} material {{in the production of}} polymers and as sterilizing agent for thermolabile materials. Although ethylene oxide is not common as an organic pollutant, its removal from numerous emission sources (e. g. ethylene oxide production plants or food and pharmaceutical sterilizing units) is of the crucial importance because of its mutagenic, teratogenic and cancerogenic effect on human health. The objective of this paper is the experimental investigation of ethylene oxide (EtO) absorption in diluted aqueous solution of sulfuric acid in order to evaluate the applicability of this procedure as well as to obtain project parameters for industrial plant realization. It was found that absorption is suitable as the fist step in the purification treatment of high EtO concentrations in the emission gases. According to the literature data, the basic parameter that defines the scrubber efficiency is the contact time, i. e. the ratio of packing height in scrubber and velocity of gas mixture. To investigate the characteristics of wet treatment in a broad range of contact time, part of experimental studies were conducted in the system with two and with three scrubbers in series. The obtained experimental results show that the high degree of EtO removal can be achieved (> 98 %) when the contact time is sufficiently long (about 25 s). The process is effective until the concentration of formed glycol in the solution reaches value of about 20 %. The process is safe and there is no <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> and explosion of air and EtO mixture, although {{at the entrance to the}} scrubber EtO concentrations are significantly above the lower explosive limit...|$|E
40|$|Forests of the Russian Far East, {{designated}} by UNESCO as a World Heritage site {{and home to}} the Siberian tiger- a highly endangered species with approximately 350 adult tigers remaining in the wild, are severely threatened by wildland fires. The frequency of catastrophic fire events is predicted to rise due to global warming trends. The large size and mountainous terrain {{of the study area}} and government control of data sources make remote sensing the only viable source of data for spatially explicit analysis. The analysis of spatio-temporal occurrence of fire events from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and meteorological records for the 2001 – 2003 period showed that catastrophic fires in the study area are driven by the disruption of the monsoon climate. A map <b>of</b> Fire <b>Danger</b> incorporating Risk <b>of</b> <b>Ignition</b> and Potential Fire Behavior was created to evaluate areas of high risk within the Siberian Tiger habitat during catastrophic fire events. The results show that fire ignition strongly correlates with human disturbance. Both area accessibility through major roads, railroads and rivers and land use have a direct impact on the frequency <b>of</b> fire <b>ignition.</b> In addition, fire frequency in evergreen needle-leaf forests which constitute 25 % of Siberian tiger habitat increases {{as a function of the}} intensity of a given fire season. Over 60 % of the potential Siberian Tiger Habitat falls within “moderate ” – “high”- “very high ” fire danger zones, which indicates species vulnerability during catastrophic fires. Future research will aim at developing a regional remotely sensed data driven model for analyzing Catastrophic Fire Threat to the Siberian Tiger, which will incorporate Habitat Preference analysis and Habitat Recovery Potential in addition to Fire Danger for several climate change scenarios. 2 Tatiana Loboda 8 / 5 / 200...|$|R
