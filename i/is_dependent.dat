5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

40|$|Upward {{combustion}} of 316 {{stainless steel}} (SS) rods is discussed and a combustion model is presented. The effects of varying oxygen pressure and rod diameter on the rate limiting processes for combustion of 316 SS are evaluated. The rate-limiting steps for combustion up 316 SS rods are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> on the incorporation and mass transport of {{oxygen in the}} molten mass, and heat transfer between the molten mass and rod. Both these rate-limiting steps are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> on rod diameter. Small (d/r/ = 0. 051 cm) 316 SS rods are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> on convective heat transfer, and larger rods (d/r/ not less than 0. 32 cm) are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> on oxygen incorporation and mass transport in the molten mass...|$|R

50|$|GFO distinguishes {{processes}} and objects. Processes unfold in time, they have temporal parts. Objects (called presentials) have no temporal parts, and may only exist on time-boundaries. Presentials <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on processes. This {{can be seen}} as a derivation of the dependency-relations in the formalization of time: processes are always framed by a chronoid; and as time-boundaries <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on chronoids, so <b>are</b> presentials <b>dependent</b> on processes.|$|R

5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> on the activation energy needed {{to form the}} transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering {{the energy of the}} transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E
