5|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, Meade {{correctly}} predicted at a council of war that Lee would attack the center of <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Paul Whitehouse voiced Thackery Earwicket, the March Hare. Burton {{stated that}} because Whitehouse {{is a great}} comedic actor, a lot of <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> came from improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Although the Serbian Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade {{would have to be}} evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.|$|E
5000|$|In default of Napoléon's line (of {{the body}} or adoptive), the {{succession}} calls Joseph and <b>his</b> <b>line,</b> followed by Louis and <b>his</b> <b>line.</b> <b>His</b> other brothers, Lucien Bonaparte and Jérôme Bonaparte, and their descendants, were {{omitted from the}} succession, even though Lucien was older than Louis, because they had either politically opposed the emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved.|$|R
25|$|He cast <b>his</b> <b>line</b> clear: and was {{promptly}} caught.|$|R
25|$|He was {{the last}} male ruler of <b>his</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{the scene}} at the Tower of Joy, Lyanna Stark was portrayed by actress Aisling Franciosi. The Danish comedian Frank Hvam portrayed the clerk at the Citadel, {{although}} <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> may have been dubbed as he was not a confident English speaker.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom to improvise <b>his</b> <b>lines.</b> Iago's supervising {{animator}} Will Finn tried to incorporate {{some aspects of}} Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.|$|E
5|$|Hamm {{acknowledged}} {{science fiction}} was a niche genre {{when the original}} film was made, and that it used science fiction to make topical issues more approachable. Hamm had the same feelings for this remake. Originally, Hamm's character was French and named Michel. Although he is interested in math and science, Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> repeatedly.|$|E
50|$|Serrurier-Bovy {{became known}} for <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of simple, refined furniture.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper is {{best known}} for his {{contemporary}} portraits. Among <b>his</b> <b>line</b> engravings were: ...|$|R

5|$|A {{separate}} {{account of the}} battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald's army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith's men cut their way through to him and slew him. After {{the death of his}} son, Rædwald furiously breached <b>his</b> <b>lines,</b> killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was {{due in part to the}} fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving force would threaten <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E

50|$|Robert Logan {{died before}} May 1608, {{the last of}} <b>his</b> <b>line.</b> <b>His</b> first wife, Elizabeth MacGill, after their divorce married Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, Tutor of Cassilis.|$|R

5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> in Yiddish {{while the rest of}} the cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings <b>his</b> <b>lines,</b> playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings <b>his</b> <b>lines,</b> joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> are subtitled in English. His {{voice and}} Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{before the}} battle Korsakov {{detached}} Sacken's 5,000 man Reserve Division to Rapperswil to reinforce Hotze {{in anticipation of}} Suvorov's approach, consequently weakening <b>his</b> defensive <b>line</b> along the Limmat before Zürich and exposing <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of communications.|$|R
5|$|Jack tells Liz and {{the writers}} of TGS Tracy Jordan that {{he wants them to}} insert General Electric (GE) {{products}} into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule ran out, and he left the production despite the fact that Peter was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. <b>His</b> <b>lines</b> in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E
5|$|Lee died {{of cancer}} in January 1981, four months into the filming of For Your Eyes Only and before any of his scenes could be filmed. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the {{character}} is said to be on leave, with <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray. Later films referred to Lee's tenure as head of the service, with a painting of him as M in MI6's Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough.|$|E
5000|$|After {{conducting}} the interview, Gray offered no apology for <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of questioning toward Rose: ...|$|R

5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line {{because they were too}} thinned out. Grant then took advantage of the situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|Lola Visual Effects {{worked on}} 48 shots, {{including}} some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive {{damage to his}} teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> so they could rotoscope his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Tate, who {{had played}} the title role in The Quatermass Experiment, {{collapsed}} and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This {{was less than a}} month before the shooting of the location filming for Quatermass II began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of <b>his</b> <b>lines</b> has been criticised by some later reviewers.|$|E
5000|$|E2. Heinrich (1903-1965), 16th (9th of <b>his</b> <b>line)</b> Duke of Krumlov (1950-1965) (adopted G1. Karel (VII/I)) ...|$|R

50|$|Admiral Barrington was {{alerted to}} the {{presence}} of the French fleet by the frigate Ariadne and organised <b>his</b> <b>line</b> of battle so that Isis and his three frigates (Venus, Aurora, and Ariadne) were close to shore guarding the windward approach, and he placed his flagship, Prince of Wales, toward the leeward. Barrington in a defensive strategy placed his transports inside the bay but behind <b>his</b> battle <b>line</b> which took him the entire evening of 14 December. By 1100 hours the next day, most of the transports had been safely tucked behind <b>his</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
