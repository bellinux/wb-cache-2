5|$|Avery {{became the}} first to walk the trail <b>end-to-end,</b> though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, the trail was {{completed}} to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the trail for hikers.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined <b>end-to-end,</b> which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin was {{selected}} for an international match between the best of London {{and the best of}} Paris, played at Stade de France on 12 March. Reichel disapproved of Guillemin's selection and suggested the Parisian front row was rather weak. In the event, London won 17–21 in an <b>end-to-end</b> contest, in which both sides scored five tries, but London managed to convert three, while Paris only one.|$|E
5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from <b>end-to-end</b> as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve <b>end-to-end</b> suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern <b>end-to-end</b> stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{launched}} on November 29, 2009 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Crossroads Station, {{and a day}} of free rides from 4:00p.m. to midnight. The following day {{marked the beginning of}} regular service, with the first runs departing their termini at 5:00am, and the new service attracted more than 1,500 riders, with <b>end-to-end</b> trips taking 20 minutes less compared to local buses on the same corridor. Swift debuted as the first bus rapid transit line in the state of Washington, ahead of King County's RapidRide, opening a year later in 2010, and one of the longest lines in the country when it opened.|$|E
5|$|The 1907–08 {{season was}} {{a season of}} change for Ottawa. Harry Smith and Hamby Shore left to join Winnipeg. Ottawa hired several free agents, {{including}} Marty Walsh, Tommy Phillips and Fred 'The Listowel Whirlwind' Taylor. Taylor was hired away from the International Professional Hockey League (IHL) for the 1908 season for a $1000 salary and a guaranteed federal civil service job. He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of 'Cyclone' for his fast skating and <b>end-to-end</b> rushes, the nickname attributed to the Canadian governor-general Earl Grey. Phillips was signed from Kenora to an even higher salary of $1,500 for the season, partially paid for by Ottawa sportsmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides <b>end-to-end</b> {{services that are}} independent {{of the structure of}} user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes <b>end-to-end</b> message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). <b>End-to-end</b> message transmission or connecting applications at the {{transport layer}} can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP.|$|E

25|$|Incognito mode is an {{optional}} mode that includes expiring chats, private notifications, and <b>end-to-end</b> encryption. For encryption, the app uses the Signal Protocol. Incognito mode {{does not include}} any Smart Reply or Google Assistant features. When the user receives a sticker from a sticker pack {{that they do not}} already have installed on their device, the app will retrieve the sticker from Google’s servers using security, but not <b>end-to-end</b> encryption.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} <b>end-to-end</b> system {{achieves a}} drastic {{improvement in the}} state of the art on this <b>end-to-end</b> task, reaching the same level of performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images (no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets, similar to LFW, but more difficult: significantly jittered (misaligned) version of LFW and SUFR-W (for example, the model’s accuracy in the LFW “unaligned & no outside data used” category is 87.55±1.41% compared to state-of-the-art APEM (adaptive probabilistic elastic matching): 81.70±1.78%).|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} <b>end-to-end</b> health {{monitoring}} IoT platforms {{are coming up}} for antenatal and chronic patients, helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements.|$|E

25|$|Inventory {{management}} in modern days is online oriented and more viable in digital. This type of dynamics order management will require <b>end-to-end</b> visibility, collaboration across fulfillment processes, real-time data automation among different companies, and integration among multiple systems.|$|E
25|$|Signal: An instant messaging, {{voice calling}} and video calling {{application}} for iOS and Android. It uses <b>end-to-end</b> encryption protocols to secure all communications to other Signal users. Signal {{can be used}} to send <b>end-to-end</b> encrypted group messages, attachments and media messages to other Signal users. All calls are made over a Wi-Fi or data connection and are free of charge, including long distance and international. Signal has a built-in mechanism for verifying that no man-in-the-middle attack has occurred. Open Whisper Systems has set up dozens of servers to handle the encrypted calls in more than 10 countries around the world to minimize latency. The clients are published under the GPLv3 license.|$|E

25|$|Line E (violet line) {{opened on}} May 27, 2006, {{connecting}} the Airport Francisco Sá Carneiro and Campanhã. Several weeks later, {{the line was}} extended until Estádio do Dragão. An <b>end-to-end</b> journey takes 33 minutes, with trains departing every 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The work {{took place}} in 1955, and was {{published}} in 1956. The karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes. Rather interestingly, the great apes have 48 chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 is now {{known to be a}} result of an <b>end-to-end</b> fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|This {{standard}} {{provides guidance}} for the safe use, maintenance, service, and installation of optical communications systems utilizing laser diodes or {{light emitting diodes}} operating at wavelengths between 0.6µm and 1mm. Optical communication systems include <b>end-to-end</b> optical fiber based links, fixed terrestrial point-to-point free-space links, {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
25|$|The DAR {{was created}} on October 1, 1894, through a merger of two <b>end-to-end</b> systems. the Windsor and Annapolis Railway (W) and the Western Counties Railway (WCR). The {{larger and more}} {{successful}} W bought out the rival WCR for $265,000. The merger was authorized by the provincial legislature in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Huawei {{delivered}} {{one of the}} world’s first LTE/EPC commercial {{networks for}} TeliaSonera in Oslo, Norway in 2009. The company launched the world's first <b>end-to-end</b> 100G solution from routers to transmission system that same year, to help meet {{the rapid growth of}} network traffic and enhance router efficiency and reliability.|$|E
25|$|Lathers had forthright {{remarks and}} candid {{comments}} {{in each of}} his newspapers. Because of his plainspoken approach the newspaper had enthusiastic readers interested in this type of journalism. Lathers often would have one large paragraph of advertisements in the newspaper written <b>end-to-end.</b> Occasionally there was poetry written in the newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Like all current low-latency {{anonymity}} networks, Tor cannot {{and does}} not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at {{the boundaries of the}} Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against traffic analysis, it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called <b>end-to-end</b> correlation).|$|E
25|$|The <b>end-to-end</b> {{principle}} {{has evolved}} over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 2016, Snowden {{delivered}} the opening keynote {{address of the}} LibrePlanet conference, a meeting of international free software activists and developers presented by the Free Software Foundation. The conference {{was held at the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was the first such time Snowden spoke via teleconference using a full free software stack, <b>end-to-end.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bumpy torus: A {{number of}} {{magnetic}} mirrors are arranged <b>end-to-end</b> in a toroidal ring. Any fuel ions that leak {{out of one}} are confined in a neighboring mirror, permitting the plasma pressure to be raised arbitrarily high without loss. An experimental facility, the ELMO Bumpy Torus or EBT was built and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Coloured {{turquoise}} on the Tube map, {{it is by}} far {{the shortest}} line on the Underground network at , with an <b>end-to-end</b> journey lasting just four minutes. In absolute terms, it is the least-used Tube line, carrying just over 15million passengers annually. However, in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is the second-most intensively-used line behind the Victoria line.|$|E
25|$|TextSecure: A {{stand-alone}} {{application for}} encrypted messaging on Android. TextSecure {{could be used}} to send and receive SMS, MMS, and instant messages. It used <b>end-to-end</b> encryption with forward secrecy and deniable authentication to secure all instant messages to other TextSecure users. TextSecure was merged with RedPhone to become Signal for Android. The source code is available under the GPLv3 license.|$|E
25|$|Neural Turing {{machines}} couple LSTM {{networks to}} external memory resources, {{with which they}} can interact by attentional processes. The combined system is analogous to a Turing machine but is differentiable <b>end-to-end,</b> allowing it to be efficiently trained by gradient descent. Preliminary results demonstrate that neural Turing machines can infer simple algorithms, such as copying, sorting and associative recall from input and output examples.|$|E
25|$|Its origins {{as a horse}} {{tramroad}} and ascent {{through the}} narrow and winding Dulas valley meant it had exceptionally tight curves. Its original passenger carriages were simple 4-wheelers derived from urban horse-drawn tramway designs with end balconies; they rode poorly and were quickly rebuilt into longer bogie carriages by placing two of the original bodies <b>end-to-end</b> on a longer underframe.|$|E
25|$|The Expo and Millennium Lines use Bombardier's Advanced Rapid Transit (ART) system, {{a system}} of {{automated}} trains driven by linear induction motors, formerly known as Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS). These trains reach speeds of 90km/h (56mph); including wait times at stops, the <b>end-to-end</b> average speed is 45km/h (28mph), three times faster than a bus and almost {{twice as fast as}} a B-Line express bus.|$|E
