25|$|Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON (or AJAJ) {{refers to}} the same dynamic web page {{methodology}} as Ajax, but instead of XML, JSON is the data format. AJAJ is a web development technique that provides for {{the ability of a}} webpage to request new data after it has loaded into the web browser. Typically it renders new data from the server in response to user actions on that webpage. For example, what the user types into a search box, client-side code then sends to the server, which immediately responds with a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> of matching database items.|$|E

50|$|The logic for a FlexSim {{model can}} be built using very little or no {{computer}} code. Most standard objects contain an array of <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists,</b> properties windows, and triggers that allow the user to customize the logic required for an accurate model of the system. FlexSim also includes a flowcharting tool to create the logic for a model using pre-built activity blocks.|$|R

Variations range from E-cards with fixed greetings like a paper card to selectable greetings (from <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists</b> or other selection options) to changeable suggested greetings.|$|R
30|$|A web-based application, e-ENBREC©, {{has also}} been {{developed}} to collate assessment data for clinical monitoring and research purposes. Access to the system is carefully regulated, and approval has to {{be obtained from the}} committee in charge of the safety of computerised databases in each country. To optimise data entry and retrieval, free text input has been minimised, and <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists</b> and other approaches leading to standardised inputs have been chosen whenever possible. The XML format is used to transfer data from e-ENBREC©(European network of bipolar research) expert centre into an anonymised common database for research purpose.|$|R
50|$|A cycle button's {{advantage}} over radio buttons or a list box {{is that it}} takes less screen space; its {{advantage over}} a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is that a single mouse click is enough to switch between the two options. However, a disadvantage is that, if the button has many options, a lot of clicks are needed to switch to the desired one. This is why some GUI environments {{have the ability to}} display the same element as a cycle button or a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list,</b> depending on the number of options.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{drop-down}}</b> <b>list</b> (abbreviated drop-down; {{also known}} as a drop-down menu. drop menu, pull-down list, picklist) is a graphical control element, similar to a list box, that allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value. It is often used in the design of graphical user interfaces, including web design.|$|E
5000|$|Address Book: Registered Yahoo! {{users can}} store {{a list of}} {{commonly}} used street addresses, making it unnecessary to type them in again. A recently entered address can be quickly recalled by selecting one from a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
50|$|Questions {{are added}} in groups. The {{questions}} within each group are organized {{on the same}} page. Surveys can include a variety of question types that take many response formats, including multiple choice, text input, <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists,</b> numerical input, slider input, and simple yes/no input. Questions can be arranged in a two-dimensional array, with options along one axis based on the questions on the other axis. Questions can depend {{on the results of}} other questions. For instance, a respondent might only be asked about transportation for his or her commute if he or she responded affirmatively to a question about having a job.|$|R

Badges are sidebar widgets which embed [...] "Add to Circles" [...] buttons and <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists</b> into off-site websites and blogs, similar to Facebook's Like Box widgets. This was officially treated by Google as a replacement for the older Google Friend Connect and its widgets, and GFC was announced by Senior Vice President of Operations Urs Hölzle on November 23, 2011, as scheduled to be retired by March 12, 2012 on all non-Blogger sites in favor of Google+ Page Badges.|$|R
40|$|Sketching is an {{important}} natural activity that helps people to quickly write their ideas before they forget them. Most current modeling tools constrain users to having to use traditional GUIs to draw diagrams (i. e. buttons, <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists,</b> etc.). TSS is a sketch-based tool for drawing Statecharts diagrams. Its on-line recognition engine interprets diagrams as they are drawn. This paper presents the first iteration {{in the development of}} this tool. The motivation behind developing TSS is to explore the main challenges that are faced when developing a sketch-based modeling tool. Our research’s long-term goal is to expand AToM 3 to have a sketch-based metamodeling tool. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Dropdown menu: In {{computing}} with graphical user interfaces, a dropdown menu or {{drop-down menu}} or <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is a user interface control GUI element ("widget" [...] or [...] "control"), {{similar to a}} list box, which allows the user to choose one value from a list.|$|E
5000|$|Combo box (text {{box with}} {{attached}} menu or List box) - A {{combination of a}} single-line text box and a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> or list box, allowing the user to either type a value directly into the control or choose {{from the list of}} existing options.|$|E

50|$|To a user, a magic {{pushbutton}} system appears {{clumsy and}} frustrating to use. Business logic is unavailable before the button press, so the user interface {{appears as a}} bland form-filling exercise. There is no opportunity for assistance in filling out fields, or for offering <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists</b> of acceptable values. In particular, {{it is impossible to}} provide assistance with later fields, based on entries already placed in earlier fields. For instance, a choice from a very large list of insurance claim codes might be filtered to a much smaller list, if the user has already selected Home/Car/Pet insurance, or if they have already entered their own identification and so the system can determine the set of risks for which they're actually covered, omitting the obscure policies that are now known to be irrelevant for this transaction.|$|R
40|$|Ontologies for {{industrial}} semantic web applications are of-ten very large. This {{is especially true}} in scientific and engineer-ing applications where there exists a large pool of technical ter-minology necessary for operation within the domain. In this pa-per we look at the problem of presenting this domain ontology to users for navigation within web applications. The conventional tree view can be considered to be cumbersome and awkward to navigate for ontologies that have a very large breadth and/or depth. We present three approaches to this ontology presentation problem — content dependent filtering, autocompletion text box and partial segments using <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists.</b> All the approaches attempt to limit the ontology presented to users at one time. We implemented two of the proposed methods of ontology presenta-tion in our demonstrators and have received positive and valuable feedback from engineers...|$|R
