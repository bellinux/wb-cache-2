25|$|The vessels were {{designed}} {{with a single}} deck with a long raised quarter deck carried to the fore side of the trawl winch and also a raised top-gallant forecastle. On the forecastle deck a windlass for working the winch was fitted, and an anchor of the stockless type housed in a long <b>hawse</b> <b>pipe.</b> An iron breakwater was also fitted to divert the sea when the vessels are being driven in heavy weather. The crew was housed under the forecastle deck, the entrance being through a lobby on the starboard side over which the forecastle deck was carried affording ample protection to the crew when entering or leaving the forecastle in heavy weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "Falk wouldn't settle {{anything}} about repairs. Told {{me to find}} out first how much wood I should require and he would see," [...] he remarked; and after he had spat peacefully in the dusk we heard over the water {{the beat of the}} tug's floats. There is, on a calm night, nothing more suggestive of fierce and headlong haste than the rapid sound made by the paddle-wheels of a boat threshing her way through a quiet sea; and the approach of Falk towards his fate seemed to be urged by an impatient and passionate desire. The engines must have been driven to the very utmost of their revolutions. We heard them slow down at last, and, vaguely, the white hull of the tug appeared moving against the black islets, whilst a slow and rhythmical clapping as of thousands of hands rose on all sides. It ceased all at once, just before Falk brought her up. A single brusque splash was followed by the long drawn rumbling of iron links running through the <b>hawse</b> <b>pipe.</b> Then a solemn silence fell upon the Roadstead.|$|E

2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} shelter deck for working the anchors, which were arranged to be stowed in <b>hawse</b> <b>pipes,</b> and two large capstans were fitted aft on the shelter deck for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|R
5000|$|When fully loaded, {{only the}} curved {{portion of the}} hull {{remained}} above the water, giving the vessel its “whaleback” appearance. Instead of crashing into {{the sides of the}} hull, waves would simply wash over the deck, meeting only the minor resistance of the rounded turrets. When fitted with <b>hawse</b> <b>pipes</b> for anchors and a guide for the tow cable, the bow somewhat resembled the snout of a pig, from which came the alternate and usually derisive appellation of [...] "pig boat". [...] The derision of scoffers notwithstanding, the design performed as McDougall expected. Whether towed or under their own power, they were seaworthy vessels and fast for their time, averaging 15 knots mph.|$|R
500|$|On 1 September 2014, {{a larger}} search by a Canadian team {{under the banner}} of the [...] "Victoria Strait Expedition" [...] found two items on Hat Island in the Queen Maud Gulf near Nunavut's King William Island — a wooden object, {{possibly}} a plug for a deck <b>hawse,</b> the iron <b>pipe</b> through which the ship's chain cable would descend into the chain locker below; and part of a boat-launching davit bearing the stamps of two Royal Navy broad arrows.|$|R

It then located one of Franklins two ships, preserved in good condition. The wreck lies {{at the bottom of}} the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of OReilly Island. The wreck has been confirmed to be that of HMS Erebus, the expeditions flagship. In 2016, a ship matching Terrors description was located in Terror Bay, off the southern coast of King William Island.|$|R
