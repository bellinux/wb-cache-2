Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{deployment}} of the first WEC in 2006, {{it has been in}} operation in real ocean seas for several months during three different time periods. During these periods measurements of electrical power, buoy motion and mooring line forces have been carried out and analyzed to enhance the knowledge about direct driven linear generator WEC dynamics. In the first test period all electrical power was converted to heat over a three phase delta-connected resistive load. To investigate the impact of a non-linear load on the WEC system, the generator was, during the second test period, connected to a non-linear load consisting of a <b>diode</b> <b>rectifier,</b> capacitors and resistors. The control, load and measurement system for the WEC have successively been expanded and now there is a remotely operated measurement system and control system.|$|E
50|$|If the {{generator}} {{is connected to}} a linear strictly resistive load, it will deliver power as soon as voltage is induced in {{the generator}}. With a non-linear load the relation is not so simple. The load is not linear due to the transmission system, whose <b>diode</b> <b>rectifier</b> results in power only {{being able to be}} extracted over certain voltage levels. Consequently, the DC voltage level limits the amplitude of the generator phase voltage. With a non-linear load the generator phase voltage will reach maximum amplitude which is approximately equal to the DC voltage. When the generator’s phase voltage reaches the level of the DC voltage current starts to flow (power is extracted) from the generator to the DC side of the rectifier. Power will be delivered as long as the waves can deliver mechanical power to the buoy {{and as long as the}} translator has not reached its upper or lower end stop. The current will increase when the speed of the translator increases. This non-linear power extraction results in different shapes of the voltages and the current pulses.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a robust {{generating}} {{system for a}} 5 MW PMSM wind turbine system with <b>diode</b> <b>rectifier</b> and DC/DC converter connected to DC link has been investigated. The design and efficiency have been studied using MATLAB Simulink and SIMPLORER and the result shows that this system topology has high efficiency. The result found was that the same generator that can provide 5 MW using an IGBT-Converter, can only give 2. 5 MW using a <b>diode</b> <b>rectifier</b> and a variable DClink. However, with series and parallel compensations the same generator can provide an output power even more than 5 MW.
