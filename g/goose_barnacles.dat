5|$|The diet of many storm petrels {{species is}} poorly known owing to {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species.

5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles</b> growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E

Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle in 350 BC in his Historia Animalium {{noted the}} habit of bird migration, moulting, egg laying and life spans, as well as {{compiling}} a list of 170 different bird species. However, he also introduced and propagated several myths, such as the idea that swallows hibernated in winter, although he noted that cranes migrated from the steppes of Scythia to the marshes at {{the headwaters of the}} Nile. The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established that, even as late as in 1878, Elliott Coues could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory. Similar misconceptions existed regarding the breeding of barnacle geese. Their nests had not been seen and it was believed that they grew by transformations of <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles,</b> an idea that became prevalent from around the 11th century and noted by Bishop Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) in Topographia Hiberniae (1187). Around 77 AD, Pliny the Elder described birds, among other creatures, in his Historia Naturalis.|$|E
500|$|Having {{successfully}} completed and published the other {{books on the}} geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles. Two volumes on Lepadidae (<b>goose</b> <b>barnacles)</b> were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that [...] "Pordock proposed you for the Coral Islands & Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles {{that you would have}} [...] to hear." ...|$|E

It {{is closely related to}} Pollicipes polymerus, a species with the same common names, but found on the Pacific coast of North America, and to Pollicipes elegans a species from the coast of Chile. It is found on rocky shores in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and is prized as a delicacy, especially in the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{barnacles}} {{are considered}} edible by humans, including Japanese <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles</b> (e.g. Capitulum mitella), and <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles</b> (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes), a delicacy in Spain and Portugal. The resemblance of this barnacle's fleshy stalk to a goose's neck gave rise {{in ancient times}} {{to the notion that}} geese, or at least certain seagoing species of wild geese, literally grew from the barnacle. Indeed, the word [...] "barnacle" [...] originally referred to a species of goose, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis, whose eggs and young were rarely seen by humans because it breeds in the remote Arctic.|$|E
2500|$|Barnacles are encrusters, {{attaching}} themselves permanently to a hard substrate. The most common, [...] "acorn barnacles" [...] (Sessilia), are sessile, growing {{their shells}} {{directly onto the}} substrate.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas {{are expected to}} play {{a prominent role in}} the conservation of marine resources and fisheries management. In the Basque Country (northern Spain) the small Marine Reserve of Gaztelugatxe (158 ha) was established in 1998. One of the aspects taken into account in protecting this area was the overexploitation of the <b>goose</b> <b>barnacle</b> Pollicipes pollicipes. Now, after five years of protection, differences in density, biomass, size and weight of the <b>goose</b> <b>barnacle</b> are investigated inside the protected area (Aketze and Gaztelugatxe locations) and outside of it, at the nearest locations (Izaro and Ogoño) which have been continuously exploited. This contribution demonstrates that the reserve could be an efficient tool in preserving the <b>goose</b> <b>barnacle</b> populations in the area. Hence, density, biomass and allometric coefficients are higher in the {{protected areas}}. These locations are also associated with higher percentages of juveniles, together with a high number of large-sized individuals...|$|R
