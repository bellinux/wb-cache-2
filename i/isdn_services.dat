50|$|Previously, on April 1985, Japanese digital {{telephone}} exchange hardware made by Fujitsu {{was used to}} experimentally deploy the world's first I interface ISDN. The I interface, unlike the older and incompatible Y interface, is what modern <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> use today.|$|E

50|$|A Service Profile Identifier (SPID) is {{a number}} issued by <b>ISDN</b> <b>service</b> {{providers}} in North America that identifies the services and features of an <b>ISDN</b> circuit. <b>Service</b> providers typically assign each B channel a unique SPID.

50|$|Digital Access Signalling System 1 (DASS1) is a {{proprietary}} protocol defined by British Telecom to provide <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> in the United Kingdom.

50|$|In the past, these links {{have made}} use of <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> but these are {{becoming}} increasingly difficult or expensive to obtain {{in some parts of}} Europe and are being phased out in others. Many proprietary systems came into existence for transporting high-quality audio over IP based on TCP, UDP or RTP. An interoperable standard for audio over IP using RTP now exists.|$|E

50|$|Telephone User Part (TUP) {{provides}} conventional PSTN telephony services {{across the}} Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) network. TUP {{was the first}} layer 4 protocol defined by the standards bodies and as such did not provision for <b>ISDN</b> <b>services.</b> It has now largely been replaced by ISUP. However, it can still be found in operational use {{in some parts of}} the world (e.g., China).|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{the number}} of ISDN {{subscribers}} dwindled as alternative technologies such as ADSL, cable Internet access, and fiber to the home gained greater popularity. On November 2, 2010, NTT announced plans to migrate their backend from PSTN to the IP network from around 2020 to around 2025. For this migration, <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> will be retired, and fiber optic services are recommended as an alternative.|$|E
50|$|France Telecom offers <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> {{under their}} product name Numeris (2 B+D), {{of which a}} {{professional}} Duo and home Itoo version is available. ISDN is generally known as RNIS in France and has widespread availability. The introduction of ADSL is reducing ISDN use for data transfer and Internet access, although it is still common in more rural and outlying areas, and for applications such as business voice and point-of-sale terminals.|$|E
50|$|The BRI {{configuration}} provides 2 data (bearer) channels (B channels) at 64 kbit/s {{each and}} 1 control (delta) channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s. The B channels {{are used for}} voice or user data, and the D channel is used for any combination of data, control/signaling, and X.25 packet networking. The 2 B channels can be aggregated by channel bonding providing a total data rate of 128 kbit/s. The BRI <b>ISDN</b> <b>service</b> is commonly installed for residential or small business <b>service</b> (<b>ISDN</b> PABX) in many countries.|$|R

This document defines a usage (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the User-to-User header field to enable interworking with this <b>ISDN</b> <b>service.</b> This document covers interworking with both public ISDN and private ISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG will also be addressed.

50|$|Videotelephony {{developed}} {{in parallel with}} conventional voice telephone systems from the mid-to-late 20th century. Very expensive videoconferencing systems rapidly evolved throughout the 1980s and 1990s from proprietary equipment, software and network requirements to standards-based technologies that were readily available {{to the general public}} at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful video codecs combined with high-speed Internet broadband and <b>ISDN</b> <b>service</b> did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.|$|R
5000|$|Services include {{traditional}} voice calls, low-level data tracking systems, and high-speed Internet {{and other}} data services as well as distress and safety services. The most recent of these provides GPRS-type services at up to 492 kbit/s via the Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) IP satellite modem {{the size of a}} notebook computer. [...] Other services provide mobile Integrated Services Digital Network (<b>ISDN)</b> <b>services</b> used by the media for live reporting on world events via videophone.|$|E
50|$|Both {{programs}} use the Session Initiation Protocol for VoIP call signalisation. Calls {{are supported}} via server-based infrastructure or direct IP to IP. Media streams are transmitted via the Real-time Transport Protocol {{which may be}} encrypted with the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and the ZRTP security protocols. Phoner provides as well an interface for configuring and using all supplementary <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> provided via CAPI and thus needs an ISDN terminal adapter hardware installed in the computer.|$|E
50|$|Consumer-oriented ADSL was {{designed}} to operate on existing lines already conditioned for Basic Rate Interface <b>ISDN</b> <b>services,</b> which itself is a digital circuit switching service (non-IP), though most incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) provision rate-adaptive digital subscriber line (RADSL) to work on virtually any available copper pair facility, whether conditioned for BRI or not.Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as high bit rate digital subscriber line (HDSL) and {{symmetric digital subscriber line}} (SDSL) to provision traditional Digital Signal 1 (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.|$|E
50|$|NFAS is a {{cost-cutting}} measure. Customers {{ordering a}} Primary Rate <b>ISDN</b> <b>service</b> {{will be charged}} for each signaling channel. Therefore an NFAS configuration can be cheaper than Facility Associated Signaling, due to historical reasons. North American switches such as the Lucent 5ESS, and the Nortel DMS-100 did not handle common channel signaling such as ISDN on the same line card that terminated the T1 circuit. So, the telephone company needs to buy and maintain a separate signaling card for every D channel.|$|R
50|$|Portions of V5 were re-used for a {{new service}} known as Narrowband Multimedia Delivery Service (or NMDS). In {{particular}} the PSTN protocol was re-used and combined with ISDN to provide a service to the subscriber. This allowed a digital connection to the subscribers house and the re-use of analogue phones across the digital connection. The AN reference point was replaced by an ISDN-like NTE. This NTE managed an analogue service and a basic rate <b>ISDN</b> <b>service</b> to the subscribers home.|$|R

50|$|BGAN: Broadband Global Area Network {{for use on}} land. BGAN {{benefits}} from the new I-4 satellites to offer a shared-channel IP packet-switched service of up to 492 kbit/s (uplink and downlink speeds may differ and depend on terminal model) and a streaming-IP service from 32 kbit/s up to X-Stream data rate (services depend on terminal model). X-Stream delivers the fastest, on demand streaming data rates from a minimum of 384 kbit/s up to around 450 kbit/s (service depend on location of user and terminal model). Most terminals also offer circuit-switched Mobile <b>ISDN</b> <b>services</b> at 64 kbit/s and even low speed (4.8 kbit/s) voice etc. services.

50|$|BT Highway was {{distinctive}} because, {{unlike most}} <b>ISDN</b> <b>services,</b> it {{was aimed at}} both home and small business users, and incorporated both analogue sockets (coloured white) and ISDN sockets (coloured blue). It was possible to plug in both Cat5 ISDN equipment and traditional POTS analogue telephones {{at the same time}} into the same master panel; normally an ISDN master panel provides only ISDN sockets. As with a standard ISDN2e service, it was possible to mix and match concurrent connections to provide two concurrent analogue phone calls, one analogue phone call and one ISDN 64kbit/s call, two 64 kbit/s ISDN calls or one 128 kbit/s ISDN call. The analogue sockets were standard UK BS6312 sockets and included a ring capacitor.|$|E
50|$|In {{telephone}} networks, {{digital communication}} is utilized for transferring many phone calls {{over the same}} copper cable or fiber cable by means of Pulse code modulation (PCM), i.e. sampling and digitization, in combination with Time division multiplexing (TDM) (1962). Telephone exchanges have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value added services. For example, the first AXE telephone exchange was presented in 1976. Since the late 1980s, digital communication to the end user has been possible using Integrated Services Digital Network (<b>ISDN)</b> <b>services.</b> Since {{the end of the}} 1990s, broadband access techniques such as ADSL, Cable modems, fiber-to-the-building (FTTB) and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes.
