5|$|The first {{reliable}} {{report of}} Malcolm II's reign {{is of an}} invasion of Bernicia in 1006, perhaps the customary crech ríg (literally royal prey, a raid by a new king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of Durham. This appears to have resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> defeat by the Northumbrians, led by Uhtred of Bamburgh, later Earl of Bernicia, which is reported by the Annals of Ulster.|$|E
5|$|The only points {{allowed by}} the team were in a 3 to 2 loss to Northwestern in a game played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> {{rainstorm}} on a field covered in mud five or six inches deep in some places. Michigan shut out seven of its eight opponents and allowed only four first downs {{in the last three}} games of the season.|$|E
5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall played a key role <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but {{was found to have}} been based on data fabricated by Ninov) of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277.|$|E
5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, {{slid off}} the runway while {{attempting}} to land at the airport <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest {{at the intersection of}} 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

5|$|Hermann Schoemann {{patrolled the}} Skagerrak to inspect neutral {{shipping}} for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted {{to lay a}} minefield off the British coast {{on the night of}} 12/13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt on the night of 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie when they could not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, on 15August, he {{took part}} in a Ranfurly Shield challenge, which {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> 24–3 defeat for Wellington at the hands of Auckland. The challengers, away to Auckland, were the underdogs but it was expected to be a close game, and at half-time Auckland were just leading by a conversion, 5–3. In the second half, Auckland's forwards imposed themselves on Wellington, who struggled to maintain the pace and were unable to respond to Auckland's scoring.|$|E

5|$|Of their 7 matches played, the Asian XI {{have won}} 4 of them. Their first match {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> 112 run {{loss to the}} World XI in the Tsunami Appeal match, and {{they went on to}} lose the opening match of the 2005 Afro-Asian Cup by two runs to the African XI. They bounced back and won the next match, however, including half centuries for each of the Sri Lankan pair Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. During the deciding match, the Asian XI bowled the African XI out for 106, but soon after starting their batting performance rain fell and the game was called off: the trophy was shared.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October, König was towed by mine {{sweepers}} {{into the}} Kuiwast roadstead. König transferred soldiers {{to the island}} of Schildaum which was then occupied. By that time, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the return voyage, König struck bottom <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> swell. The ship was repaired in Kiel; the work lasted until 17 November.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

5|$|The armies {{stared at}} one another <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> rain across the bloody fields on July 4, {{the same day that}} the Vicksburg {{garrison}} surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.|$|E
5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air {{could be described as}} Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Yardley scored 788 runs at {{an average}} of 23.17, with just one century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less {{frequently}} than before the war and took only nine wickets. He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> defeat for the amateurs. Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice-captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter, continuing his pre-war role.|$|E
50|$|The SPAD 16 was a {{development}} of the SPAD 11. Essentially a SPAD 11 with a Lorraine-Dietrich engine of 240 bhp, or 250 bhp according to some sources. The new engine, while more powerful, resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> aircraft and performance was slightly inferior to the SPAD 11. The original handling problems were largely unresolved.|$|R

He won a silver medal at the 1978 World Championships and a gold at the 1986 Asian Games. He is frequently confused with his twin brother Mohammad Hassan Mohebbi (محمد‌حسن محبی), who competed alongside, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> category (90 kg).|$|R
5|$|Australia {{once more}} batted {{first in the}} third Test, scoring 489. For {{tactical}} reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe. Wet weather altered {{the course of the}} match and, despite an opening partnership of 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Australia won by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth Test as England won by an innings, but Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, he scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66, and made two half-centuries in addition to his three hundreds. Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world. Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and Wisden judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series. In all games, Hobbs scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 {{of a heart}} embolism. His {{father did}} not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from {{bronchial}} pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> fog {{that allowed the}} North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
