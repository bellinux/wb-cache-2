40|$|The aim is the {{prediction}} of the failure time of prestressed concrete beams under low cyclic load. Since the experiments last long for low load, accelerated failure tests with higher load are conducted. However, the accelerated tests are expensive so that only few tests are available. To obtain a more precise failure time prediction, the additional information of time points of breakage of <b>tension</b> <b>wires</b> is used. These breakage time points are modeled by a nonlinear birth process. This allows not only point prediction of a critical number of broken <b>tension</b> <b>wires</b> but also prediction intervals which express the uncertainty of {{the prediction}}...|$|R
5000|$|Wire braced: alone (as on the Boeing P-26 Peashooter) or, more usually, in {{addition}} to struts, <b>tension</b> <b>wires</b> also help to support the wing. Unlike a strut, a wire can act only in tension.|$|R
5000|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is based}} on the principle which Ilizarov called [...] "the theory of tensions". Through controlled and mechanically applied tension stress, Ilizarov was able to show that the bone and soft tissue can be made to regenerate in a reliable and reproducible manner. The top rings of the Ilizarov (fixed to the healthy bone by the <b>tensioned</b> <b>wire)</b> allow force to be transferred through the external frame (the vertical metal rods), bypassing the fracture site. Force is then transferred back to the healthy bone through the bottom ring and the <b>tensioned</b> <b>wires.</b> This allows the Ilizarov apparatus to act as a sort of bridge, both immobilizing the fracture site and relieving it of stress, while allowing for the movement of the entire limb and partial weight-bearing. Middle rings (and <b>tensioned</b> <b>wires)</b> act to hold the bone fragments in place and to give greater structural support to the apparatus and limb. However, the critical load bearing rings are the top and bottom rings which transfer the force from the healthy bone down to the healthy bone, bypassing the fracture site.|$|R

40|$|In the multi wire sawing {{process the}} <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> is an {{important}} parameter for reliability and wafer quality. Changes of wire quality and <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> {{from one end of}} a wire web in a multi wire saw to the other are investigated by several methods: <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> measurements in the wire saw, wire elongation during an industrial process and material testing of representative wires. Two mechanisms for the loss of <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> are identified. Firstly, the decrease of wire diameter due to abrasion causes a slow loss of <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> along the whole wire web. Secondly, plastic deformation of the wire due to random overloading leads to a fast decrease of the <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> within the first few centimeters of the wire web. Both effects are confirmed by modeling and calculations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that clamping a <b>tensioned</b> <b>wire</b> {{can cause a}} reduction in <b>wire</b> <b>tension.</b> Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The <b>tension</b> in the <b>wire</b> was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the wire was clamped to the frame, the <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that clamping the wire could be considered to squeeze the wire outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent. The results of this study highlight a general engineering problem: how can a <b>tensioned</b> <b>wire</b> be secured to a structure without an appreciable loss of tension? If the performance of the structure depends on the <b>wire</b> <b>tension,</b> this performance will change when the wire is secured...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether additional <b>tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> in the plate for traumatic disruption of symphysis pubis has clinical benefits. Therefore, outcomes and complications were compared between a plate fixation group and a plate with <b>tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> group. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 64 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the symphysis pubis by using a plate alone (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00939) or a plate with <b>tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00925). All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 240 months (mean, 34. 40 months; range, 262 ̆ 01339 months). Demographic characteristics, outcomes, movement of the metal works, complications, revision surgery, and Majeed functional score were compared. Results Significant screw pullout was relatively significantly more frequently found in the plate fixation group than in the plate with <b>tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> group (P 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 009). In terms of the overall rate of all-cause revision surgery, including significant loosening, symptomatic hardware, and patient-requested hardware removal during follow-up period, the plate with <b>tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> group showed a significantly lower rate. Conclusion <b>Tension</b> band <b>wiring</b> in combination with a symphyseal plate showed better radiological outcomes, a lower incidence of hardware loosening, and a lower rate of revision surgery than plate fixation alone. This technique would have some potential advantages in terms of avoiding significant movement of plate, symptomatic hardware failure, and revision surgery...|$|R
