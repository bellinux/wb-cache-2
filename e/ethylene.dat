5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the <b>ethylene</b> glycol itself. As the metabolism of <b>ethylene</b> glycol progresses there will be less <b>ethylene</b> glycol and this will decrease the blood <b>ethylene</b> glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>ethylene</b> glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood <b>ethylene</b> glycol concentration. <b>Ethylene</b> glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of <b>ethylene</b> glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out <b>ethylene</b> glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as <b>ethylene</b> glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. <b>Ethylene</b> glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using <b>ethylene</b> glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to <b>ethylene</b> glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, <b>ethylene</b> glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to <b>ethylene</b> glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from <b>ethylene</b> glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking <b>ethylene</b> glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain.

40|$|The {{rotational}} barrier for substituted <b>ethylenes</b> was calculated with MO ab initio methods, {{both in the}} Hartree-Fock (HF) single determinant scheme and with multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) approaches. The HF model affords reliable results only when applied to molecules substituted with strong electron donor groups, assigning a push-pull character to the molecule. The MCSCF approach was employed for calculating {{rotational barrier}}s in poorly polarized <b>ethylenes</b> not directly amenable to the HF methods; however, this method was found hard to handle for low symmetry molecules with substituents interacting with the double bond. A method is proposed based on the interpolation of {{the energy of the}} perpendicular conformation from a Fourier truncated function constructed with HF molecular energies calculated for frozen conformations twisted up to 60 degrees, The application of HF theory for studying internal rotation in substituted <b>ethylenes</b> with poorly polarized character is discussed and an upper limit of 35 - 40 kcal/mol can be set up for having reliable barriers from the calculated energy of the rotational transition state at this level of theory.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the chlorinated <b>ethylenes</b> may {{be explained}} by the formation of chloroethylene epoxides as the first intermediate products.

5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs.

That is roughly 16 mL of 50% <b>ethylene</b> glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child.

5|$|<b>Ethylene</b> glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring <b>ethylene</b> glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized <b>ethylene</b> glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of <b>ethylene</b> glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes <b>ethylene</b> glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Chlorinated <b>ethylenes</b> are metabolized in mammals, {{as a first}} step, to epoxides. The fate {{of these}} electrophilic {{intermediates}} may be reaction with nucleophiles (alkylation), hydrolysis, or intramolecular rearrangement. The latter reaction has been studied in the whole series of chlorinated epoxiethanes. The rearrangement products found were: acyl chlorides (tetrachloro-, trichloro-, and 1, 1 -dichloroethylenes), or chlorinated aldehydes (1, 2 -dichloroethylenes, cis- and trans-, vinyl chloride). The metabolites found in vivo are identical with, or further derivatives of these rearrangement products, with one important exception: trichloroethylene.

All chlorinated <b>ethylenes</b> have been investigated in a tissue-mediated mutagenicity testing system.
