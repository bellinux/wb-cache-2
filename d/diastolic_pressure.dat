25|$|During each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (<b>diastolic)</b> <b>pressure.</b> The {{blood pressure}} in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence {{blood pressure in}} veins.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{of the effects of}} synephrine in humans, most of them {{focusing}} on its cardio-vascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.|$|E

2500|$|Blood {{pressure}} (BP) is {{the pressure}} of circulating blood {{on the walls of}} blood vessels. [...] When used without further specification, [...] "blood pressure" [...] usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation. [...] Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heart beat) over <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressure</b> (minimum in between two heart beats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure (considered to be zero for convenience).|$|E
2500|$|For each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure is peak {{pressure in the}} arteries, which occurs {{near the end of}} the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting. <b>Diastolic</b> <b>pressure</b> is minimum pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood.

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{pulmonary artery}} catheter has two lumens (Swan-Ganz) and {{is equipped with}} an inflatable balloon at the tip, which facilitates its placement into the pulmonary artery through the flow of blood. [...] The balloon, when inflated, causes the catheter to [...] "wedge" [...] in a small pulmonary blood vessel. [...] So wedged, the catheter can provide an indirect measurement of the pressure in the left atrium of the heart, showing a mean pressure, in addition to a, x, v, and y waves which have implications for status of the left atria and the mitral valve. [...] Left ventricular end <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressure</b> (LVedp) is measured using a different procedure, with a catheter that has directly crossed the aortic valve and is well positioned in the left ventricle.

2500|$|Older, small breeds of {{dogs are}} prone to {{congestive}} heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition {{is known to be}} inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. [...] Degenerative valve disease is {{the most common form of}} heart disease in dogs. [...] Mitral insufficiency leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). [...] Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). [...] Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. [...] Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. [...] Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, vasoconstriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. [...] It also results in an increase in <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressure</b> and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan - which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator - is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently.|$|E

The algorism is to estimate systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressures</b> based on a correlation to photoplethysmographic information, calibrated with the oscillometric pressures. Simultaneous recording with the estimation and the servo-plethysmo- manometry with FinapresR was done for 1 volunteer, and the intra-arterial monitoring was done for the other volunteer. Coefficient of correlation was 0. 45 for the systolic pressures between the estimation and FinapresR, and that was 0. 56 for the <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressures</b> between them. Coefficient of correlation was 0. 90 for the systolic pressures between the estimation and the intra-arterial monitoring, and 0. 83 for the <b>diastolic</b> <b>pressures</b> between them.

The intra-arterial pressure is for an artery, and Riva-Rocci/Korotkoff technique or oscillometric BP are also for the artery just below the cuff applied. This photoplethysmography might estimate integrated hemoglobin dynamics among arteries, veins and capillaries. The different tissues to measure and different modality to sense might make those differences.
