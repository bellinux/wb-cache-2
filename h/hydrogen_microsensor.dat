50|$|MEMS {{hydrogen}} sensor - The combination of nanotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology allows {{the production of}} a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>microsensor</b> that functions properly at room temperature. One type of MEMS-based {{hydrogen sensor}} is coated with a film consisting of nanostructured indium oxide (In2O3) and tin oxide (SnO2). A typical configuration for mechanical Pd-based hydrogen sensors is the usage of a free-standing cantilever that is coated with Pd. In the presence of H2, the Pd layer expands and thereby induces a stress that causes the cantilever to bend. Pd-coated nanomechanical resonators have also been reported in literature, relying on the stress-induced mechanical resonance frequency shift caused by the presence of H2 gas. In this case, the response speed was enhanced {{through the use of a}} very thin layer of Pd (20 nm). Moderate heating was presented as a solution to the response impairment observed in humid conditions.|$|E
30|$|Zhao et al. (2016 a) {{developed}} a set-up composed of hydrogen gas sensor and capillary pH and Mg 2 + microsensors {{to measure the}} real-time concentration of magnesium ion, hydroxyl ion, and hydrogen gas. By using the set-up, they were able to generate a map of hydrogen concentration {{in the vicinity of}} magnesium alloy sample. The set-up was further developed to a transdermally (non-invasive) electrochemical <b>hydrogen</b> <b>microsensor</b> (Fig.  6 c) and tested for measuring in vivo corrosion of magnesium implants in mouse (Fig.  6 d) (Zhao et al. 2016 c). Using the sensor, they realized that hydrogen permeated through the skin at the concentration as low as 30 – 400  μM with a fast response time of 30  s. Although the hydrogen levels permeated through the skin were very low, the sensor changed its color to give a 3 D visualization of hydrogen permeation (Fig.  6 e) (Zhao et al. 2016 b). When the transdermal hydrogen sensor measurement results were combined with those of ICP-MS and XPS, a more comprehensive understanding of in vivo corrosion behavior of magnesium was obtained. It was realized that the impurities were among the determinant factors responsible for rapid in vivo corrosion of magnesium (Zhao et al. 2017 a). However, since it is a non-invasive sensor which depends on the hydrogen permeation through the skin, it may not be practical for monitoring in vivo corrosion of magnesium implants placed deeper beneath the skin, i.e., bone screw and plate implanted under the muscle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHydrogen {{is often}} formed in sulfidic environments where {{interference}} from hydrogen sulfide has prevented its analysis by amperometric <b>hydrogen</b> <b>microsensors.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>microsensors</b> were made insensitive to hydrogen sulfide {{by placing a}} sulfide trap (guard) containing solutions of heavy metal ions, sulfide-oxidizing ferricyanide, or alkaline chemicals at the sensor tip. The overall most efficient sulfide guard consisted of a solution of ZnCl 2 in propylene carbonate which resulted in absence of interference from 5 mmolL− 1 hydrogen sulfide and also alleviated any interference from oxygen. The hydrogen sensors with ZnCl 2 -propylene carbonate traps could be used at temperatures up to 60 °C without exhibiting excessive baseline currents. The ability of a guarded sensor to resolve the hydrogen distribution in a sulfidic microbial mat with up to 2. 4 μmolL− 1 H 2 was demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>microsensors,</b> which use {{different}} mechanisms to detect the gas. Palladium is used in many of these, because it selectively absorbs hydrogen gas and forms the compound palladium hydride. Palladium-based sensors have a strong temperature dependence which makes their response time too large at very low temperatures. Palladium sensors have to be protected against carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the effectiveness of thermal glow plug igniters to burn hydrogen in a condensing steam environment due {{to the presence of}} water sprays. The {{experiments were}} designed to determine if a detonation or accelerated flame could occur in a hydrogen-air-steam mixture which was initially nonflammable due to steam dilution but was rendered flammable by rapid steam condensation due to water sprays. Eleven Hydrogen Igniter Tests were conducted in the test vessel. The vessel was instrumented with pressure transducers, thermocouple rakes, gas grab sample bottles, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>microsensors,</b> and cameras. The vessel contained two prototypic engineered systems: (1) a deliberate hydrogen ignition system and (2) a water spray system. Experiments were conducted under conditions scaled to be nearly prototypic of those expected in Advanced Light Water Reactors (such as the Combustion Engineering (CE) System 80 +), with prototypic spray drop diameter, spray mass flux, steam condensation rates, hydrogen injection flow rates, and using the actual proposed plant igniters. The lack of any significant pressure increase during the majority of the burn and condensation events signified that localized, benign hydrogen deflagration(s) occurred with no significant pressure load on the containment vessel. Igniter location {{did not appear to be}} a factor in the open geometry. Initially stratified tests with a stoichiometric mixture in the top showed that the water spray effectively mixes the initially stratified atmosphere prior to the deflagration event. All tests demonstrated that thermal glow plugs ignite hydrogen-air-steam mixtures under conditions with water sprays near the flammability limits previously determined for hydrogen-air-steam mixtures under quiescent conditions. This report describes these experiments, gives experimental results, and provides interpretation of the results. 12 refs., 127 figs., 16 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{white rot}} fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, {{produces}} enzymes, which {{are capable of}} degrading chemical pollutants. It was detennined that this fungus has multiple growth phases. The study provided infonnation {{that can be used}} to classify growth kinetic parameters, substrate mass transfer and liquid medium momentum transfer effects in continuous secondary metabolite production studies. P. chrysosporium strain BKMF 1767 (ATCC 24725) was grown at 37 QC in single fibre capillary membrane bioreactors (SFCMBR) made of glass. The SFCMBR systems with working volumes of 20. 4 ml and active membrane length of 160 mm were positioned vertically. Dry biofilm density was determined by using a helium pycnometer. Biofilm differentiation was detennined by taking samples for image analysis, using a Scanning Electron Microscope at various phases of the biofilm growth. Substrate consumption was detennined by using relevant test kits to quantify the amount, which was consumed at different times, using a varying amount of spore concentrations. Growth kinetic constants were detennined by using the substrate consumption and the dry biofilm density model. Oxygen mass transfer parameters were determined by using the Clark type oxygen microsensors. Pressure transducers were used to measure the pressure, which was needed to model the liquid medium momentum transfer in the lumen of the polysulphone membranes. An attempt was made to measure the glucose mass transfer across the biofilm, which was made by using a <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>microsensor,</b> but without success...|$|R
