5|$|The North American species once {{described}} by Alexander H. Smith, P.kauffmaniana, {{is closely related}} to P.flammans, but differs in having a more distinctly viscid cap. Smith was later to revise his opinion on the existence of P.kauffmaniana as a unique species—he believed that environmental variations in humidity were the cause of differences in the cap cuticle <b>gelatinization</b> observed in Pholiotas collected from different North American locales. P.kauffmaniana is now considered synonymous with P.flammans.|$|E
5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing {{directly from the}} surface of the basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and are separated from the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the <b>gelatinization</b> of the inner walls of the peridiole.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a <b>gelatinization</b> of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
25|$|Starch <b>gelatinization</b> {{and protein}} {{coagulation}} {{are the major}} changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within the pasta cause a constant change in structure as the pasta cooks.|$|E
25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch <b>gelatinization,</b> depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E
500|$|The initial {{studies on}} the {{development}} of the fruiting bodies in Crucibulum were performed by the brothers Tulasne (1844), Sachs (1855), DeBary (1866), Eidam (1877), and Walker (1920). Collectively, these early researchers determined that basidiospores are produced on club-shaped basidia which line the internal cavity of the peridiole. [...] Basidia typically have 4 spores, attached by a short projection (a sterigma); after being detached from the basidia the spores migrate towards the center of the peridiole concurrently with the collapse and <b>gelatinization</b> of the underlying tissues.|$|E
500|$|Deep frying food {{is defined}} as a process where food is {{completely}} submerged in hot oil at temperatures typically between [...] and [...] One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or tempura; breadcrumbs may also be used. After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins to denature, starches to undergo starch <b>gelatinization,</b> and dietary fiber to soften.|$|E
50|$|Starch <b>gelatinization</b> during cake baking can be {{impaired}} by sugar {{competing for}} water, preventing <b>gelatinization</b> and improving texture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gelatinization</b> {{temperature}} {{is related to}} many factors such as cooking time, granula size, molecular size of starch fraction; it is also used as criteria classified rice in some countries. Like other factors it is also influenced by environment such as ripening temperature, genetic and rice varieties as well as cooking time. <b>Gelatinization</b> {{temperature is}} direct related to amylose contents; the higher the amylose the higher the <b>gelatinization</b> temperature, hence high waxy rice has higher <b>gelatinization</b> temperature than waxy or very low waxy rice.|$|E
50|$|Starch {{undergoes}} <b>gelatinization</b> as {{a result}} of baking. Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough’s temperature stays under the <b>gelatinization</b> temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the <b>gelatinization</b> temperature, amylopectin crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order. At the same time, starch <b>gelatinization</b> actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of amylose leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>gelatinization</b> process, the {{moisture}} content {{does not change}} very much so another drying stage is required to achieve the desired moisture content of 12%. Drying is done in a chamber drier and when drying, it must have an initial temperature of below 40 °C to avoid further <b>gelatinization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Starch <b>gelatinization</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch <b>gelatinization,</b> which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch <b>gelatinization</b> occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, amyloses leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the <b>gelatinization</b> of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and <b>gelatinization</b> continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch <b>gelatinization.</b> Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying. Moreover, as a common additive, guar gum can not only increases the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouth feel, it can also increase the water binding ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gelatinization</b> {{temperature}} of starch depends upon plant type {{and the amount}} of water present, pH, types and concentration of salt, sugar, fat and protein in the recipe, as well as starch derivatisation technology are used. Some types of unmodified native starches start swelling at 55 °C, other types at 85 °C. [...] The <b>gelatinization</b> {{temperature of}} modified starch depends on for example on the degree of cross-linking of the amylopectin, the degree of acid treatment, acetylation.Gel temperature can also be modified by genetic manipulation of starch synthase genes. <b>Gelatinization</b> temperature also depends on the amount of damaged starch granules. These will swell faster. Damaged starch can be produced, for example, during the wheat milling process, or when drying the starch cake in the starch plant. There is an inverse correlation between <b>gelatinization</b> temperature and glycemic index.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{technique}} to study starch gelation is {{by using a}} Brabender Viscoamylograph. It is a common technique used by food industries to determine the pasting temperature, swelling capacity, shear/thermal stability {{and the extent of}} retrogradation. Under controlled conditions, starch and distilled water is heated at a constant heating rate in a rotating bowl and then cooled down. The viscosity of the mixture deflects a measuring sensor in the bowl. This deflection is measured as viscosity in torque over time vs. temperature, and recorded on the computer. The viscoamylograph provides the audience with the beginning of <b>gelatinization,</b> <b>gelatinization</b> maximum, <b>gelatinization</b> temperature, viscosity during holding, and viscosity at the end of cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} physiochemical properties of cooking quality of rice are amylose content and <b>gelatinization</b> temperature.|$|E
50|$|Eleven events occur {{concurrently}} during baking, some {{of which}} (such as starch <b>gelatinization)</b> would not occur at room temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Raw {{material}} treatment. Usually rice or barley is {{steeped in}} water, then steamed to promote starch <b>gelatinization</b> and cooled.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{suspension}} of starch in water, which needs dewatering up to 20% of moisture.This {{is equivalent to}} the moisture content of commercial starch when stored. High temperatures cannot be used in this process because of the danger of starch <b>gelatinization</b> which destroys granular structure. It may result in significant changes of the functional starch properties. Therefore, removal of excess water from milk shall be done only under conditions that prevent the <b>gelatinization</b> of starch.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{is another}} method industries use to examine properties of gelatinized starch. As water is heated with starch granules, <b>gelatinization</b> occurs, involving an endothermic reaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gelatinization</b> {{improves}} {{the availability of}} starch for amylase hydrolysis.So gelatinisation of starch is used constantly in cooking to make the starch digestable or to thicken/bind water in roux, sauce, or soup.|$|E
5000|$|Direct water {{contact and}} {{excessive}} {{moisture in the}} environment can cause structural problems for parchment including: expansion of object; discoloration; alteration of surface coatings; <b>gelatinization</b> of skin; and realignment of fibers.|$|E
50|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>gelatinization</b> {{is called the}} T-onset. T-peak is the position where the endothermic reaction occurs at the maximum. T-conclusion is when all the starch granules are fully gelatinized, and the curve remains stable.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} produce first-rate products, the starch beads are poured onto plates in a thick layer, and the plates is slowly drawn through a tunnel charged with steam. In this way, uniform <b>gelatinization</b> is ensured.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, during heat treatment, the {{temperature}} is kept moderate so that only the surface layer of the lumps of the moist starch begins to gelatinize, and this process is described as <b>gelatinization.</b> One process of <b>gelatinization</b> is performed by placing the pearls inside shallow pans, which are then placed inside a brick oven. The pans are covered with a towel soaked in oil or fat to prevent burning the starch. While the pearls are heated over a moderate fire, it is stirred continuously with large forks to prevent burning. When this hand-baking process is applied to manufacture pearls, irregularly shaped beads may be obtained, inferior in colour and in other qualities.|$|E
50|$|The cooking {{process takes}} {{place within the}} {{extruder}} where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10-20 bar). The process can induce both protein denaturation and starch <b>gelatinization</b> under some conditions.|$|E
50|$|Dubraj is {{a variety}} of rice. It is an {{aromatic}} short to medium grain rice. It is a traditional Indian cultivar with intermediate amylose and <b>gelatinization</b> temperature. It is most common in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, mainly Bilaspur.|$|E
50|$|Starch <b>gelatinization</b> {{and protein}} {{coagulation}} {{are the major}} changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within the pasta cause a constant change in structure as the pasta cooks.|$|E
50|$|Polyphosphate {{is used in}} instant noodles as {{additive}} {{to improve}} starch <b>gelatinization</b> during cooking (rehydration) to allow more water retention in the noodles. Normally 0.1% of flour weight phosphate compounds are added to water before mixing and making the dough.|$|E
50|$|Starch <b>gelatinization</b> is {{a process}} of {{breaking}} down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites (the hydroxyl hydrogen and oxygen) to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule in water. Water acts as a plasticizer.|$|E
50|$|Starches are {{modified}} {{to enhance their}} performance in different applications. Starches may be {{modified to}} increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time, cooling, or freezing; to change their texture; to decrease or increase their viscosity; to lengthen or shorten <b>gelatinization</b> time; or to increase their visco-stability.|$|E
50|$|By {{heating the}} ground, cleaned feedstock, starch <b>gelatinization</b> takes place: the intermolecular bonds of the starch {{molecules}} are broken down, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule, so the chains begin to separate into an amorphous form. This prepares the starch for hydrolysis.|$|E
5000|$|Baking: The proofed {{dough is}} loaded {{into a hot}} oven for baking. During the first few minutes, the {{remaining}} rise will occur in the dough and is known as oven spring. Starch <b>gelatinization</b> begins at , the yeast dies at , and the baking is finished when the product reaches an internal temperature of [...]|$|E
50|$|The adjunct grains {{that can}} be added to the mash include wheat, corn, rye, and rice. Adjunct grains may first need <b>gelatinization</b> and cooling. They are used to create varietal beers such as wheat beer and oatmeal stout, to create grain whisky, or to lighten the body (and cut costs) as in commercial, mass-produced pale lagers.|$|E
50|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} is by simultaneous division of all {{cells of the}} colony to form autocolonies that are liberated by a <b>gelatinization</b> of the colonial envelope. Sexual reproduction occurs by division of each cell of the colony into 16-32 zoogametes. Zoogametes show indications of heterogamy, a slight difference in the size and motility of the pairs that fuse to form the smooth walled zygote.|$|E
50|$|Adding a {{small amount}} of calcium {{chloride}} may be used to alter the pH to the optimum value when dehydrated egg whites with a higher pH are used. It may also alter the flour <b>gelatinization</b> temperature. This ensures that when large quantities of cakes are produced, the cakes will be the best possible quality and volume, without a gummy layer forming.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to strong}} {{associations}} of hydrogen bonding, longer amylose molecules will form a stiff gel. Amylopectin molecules with longer branched structure, increases {{the tendency to}} form strong gels. Granule size do not directly impact starch performance, {{but it is one}} of the main factors affecting starch <b>gelatinization</b> and retrogradation. High amylopectin starches will have a stable gel, but will be softer than high amylose gels.|$|E
