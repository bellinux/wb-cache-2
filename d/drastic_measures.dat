5|$|Nasser's {{return to}} Egypt coincided with Husni al-Za'im's Syrian coup d'état. Its success and evident popular {{support among the}} Syrian people {{encouraged}} Nasser's revolutionary pursuits. Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister Ibrahim Abdel Hadi regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers. According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations. Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser. The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} scrutiny being {{imposed by}} the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E

50|$|In 1904, Hammerstein {{took the}} <b>drastic</b> <b>measure</b> {{of turning the}} Victoria from {{legitimate}} theatre to vaudeville, and over the succeeding years, his risk proved tremendously profitable.

5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> {{to protect}} his plans, {{programming}} the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00, {{the leading}} French ship of the line, Magnanime, came within range with her bow chasers. Calcutta {{continued}} sailing southwards, remaining {{ahead of the}} squadron but not at a sufficient distance to avoid Magnanimes fire. Realising that unless he took <b>drastic</b> <b>measures</b> his ship would be caught, Woodriff turned Calcutta back towards Magnanime, hoping to disable her before the next ship in line, the frigate Thétis, could join the battle. Captain Pierre-François Violette on Magnanime prepared to meet Calcutta and the engagement rapidly became furious, Calcutta and Magnanime exchanging full broadsides at close range. Within 45 minutes, {{it was clear that}} Woodriff's gamble had failed. The larger and more powerful Magnanime inflicted severe damage to the British ship's rigging, rendering her unable to manoeuvre or escape, with the remainder of the French squadron bearing down. With defeat inevitable, Woodriff spared the lives of his men by striking his colours and surrendering to Violette. Although Calcutta was badly damaged among her rigging and sails, her hull had suffered little from the engagement and she had only lost six killed and six wounded. French casualties were negligible, although Armide was forced to undergo extensive temporary repairs on her own sails and rigging before she was able to operate as a scout once more. Brothers had also been captured: the corvette Sylphe had separated during the chase and rapidly overhauled the lumbering merchant ship, which had surrendered without a fight.|$|E

Bush expressed to them his anger that the government had to take such a <b>drastic</b> <b>measure</b> but reminded them that he is supporting the bailout because he felt a risk of an economic depression was not worth taking.|$|R
50|$|During the 1740s, Admiral Charles Knowles {{provoked}} some of {{the largest}} impressment riots in the history of Britain's American and Caribbean colonies. Knowles had a habit of disregarding local laws and customs when pressing men into service on his warships. In 1743, for example, he provoked a violent conflict in Antigua when he captured crewmen from a privateer ship, a <b>drastic</b> <b>measure</b> normally reserved for national emergencies.|$|R
25|$|As Lula gained {{strength}} {{in the run-up to}} the 2002 elections, the fear of <b>drastic</b> <b>measures,</b> and comparisons with Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation.

Opposition politicians became increasingly persecuted and threatened.|$|E

50|$|Awdry's {{original}} idea {{had been to}} write Henry out of the series, hence the character's illness. But by the sixth book, Henry the Green Engine, he had decided against such a <b>drastic</b> <b>measure.</b> He instead decided to have the character involved in a serious accident, allowing him to be rebuilt into a Class 5MT which, being a real locomotive, would effectively force Dalby to be consistent.|$|R
50|$|Argentina {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of beef. It is also the third-largest exporter (after Brazil and Australia), and has the world's highest consumption rate (an average of 68 kg per person per year). On 8 March 2006, President Néstor Kirchner took the <b>drastic</b> <b>measure</b> of banning all exports of beef for a period of 180 days, in order to stop continuous price rises.|$|R
50|$|Despite early {{successes in}} {{repelling}} the Roman sieges, the Zealots fought amongst themselves, and they lacked proper leadership, resulting in poor discipline, training, and {{preparation for the}} battles that were to follow.

These measures were also brought {{in during the}} 1976 drought.|$|E
25|$|In 1801, Russia {{formally}} annexed Georgia, deepening Russia's {{commitment to}} the region. In subsequent years, {{a growing number of}} small-scale raids and ambushes by Chechen fighters on Russian forces moving through the Caucasus prompted the Russians to mount two substantial military expeditions into Chechen territory, both of which were defeated, and Russian leaders began considering more <b>drastic</b> <b>measures.</b> These were postponed however by Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia.|$|E

This church appears to have been built by the same master carpenter as those from Glod (before 1784) and Poienile de sub Munte (1798). The interior was painted by Nicolae Cepschin in 1788.|$|R
