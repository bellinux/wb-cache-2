Depending on the relative width of the magnetic <b>film,</b> <b>L,</b> compared to the wavelength of the external field, λ, different transition regimes are observed. For small systems (Lλ), the transition is driven by Anomalous Stochastic Resonance.

The distinction between different stochastic resonance regimes is discussed at length, both qualitatively by means of snapshot configurations, as well as quantitatively via residence-length and order-parameter probability distributions.

40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Franco regime in 1975, Spain has {{experienced}} a dramatic influx of Moroccan immigrants, prompting a number of cultural critics to recall the period of al-Andalus, as the Iberian Peninsula was known during its many centuries under Islamic rule. While some across Europe detect a sense of circular return in this evocation of al-Andalus, others, especially within Spain, have insisted on distancing Spain from its 2 ̆ 7 Africanized 2 ̆ 7 heritage {{in the face of this}} immigration. Yet, paradoxically, this very influx of Moroccan immigrants has sustained Spain 2 ̆ 7 s link to the rest of modern Europe. As a destination for Arab/Muslim immigrants, Spain now finds itself in a sociopolitical situation similar to that of other European countries. By studying the re-mapping of Europe as a topography of immigration, and by investigating the cultural production that has been translating and mediating traditional Mediterranean identities, this study examines the creation of new 2 ̆ 2 European 2 ̆ 2, new 2 ̆ 2 Moorish 2 ̆ 2, and new 2 ̆ 2 European Islamic 2 ̆ 2 identities. The first chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Memory, Return, and the Other Side, 2 ̆ 2 focuses on memory and return through the analysis of the 2006 Spanish/Arabic compilation Cuentos de las dos Orillas (Tale of Two Shores), Jo també soc catalana (I Too am Catalan) by Najat El Hachmi, and Tahar ben Jelloun 2 ̆ 7 s Partir (2006). The second chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Romancing Europe: Postcolonial Foundational Fictions, 2 ̆ 2 challenges the legalized, heteronormative 2 ̆ 7 romance 2 ̆ 7 as the idealized deployment of national identity by analyzing Manuel Valls 2 ̆ 7 ¿Dónde estás Ahmed? (2000), Partir, and Yasmine Kassari 2 ̆ 7 s <b>film</b> <b>L</b> 2 ̆ 7 enfant endormi (2004). The final chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Europe via Spain: Media, Islam, and the Sounds of Immigrant Identity, 2 ̆ 2 examines Antoni Verdaguer 2 ̆ 7 s film Raval, Raval (2007) and the work of hip-hop artists Abd-Al-Malik and Outlandish as constitutive of a new pan-European immigrant soundscape. Central to this study is the concept of traslado, used here to trace the translation and transfer of cultural memory and national identity through a focus on immigrants who have been moving between and transcending national spaces. In tracing the re-routing of 2 ̆ 2 Moorishness, 2 ̆ 2 this study integrates many areas of postcolonial, gender, and border studies, ultimately proposing a wider cross-reading of texts that reflects today 2 ̆ 7 s increasingly transnational immigrant subjectivities. ...|$|E

Neste trabalho estudaremos através da técnica do operador diferencial o efeito de superfície no modelo de Heisenberg quântico anisotrópico de spin 1 / 2, via teoria de campo efetivo (EFT), num aglomerado de dois spins, para uma rede cúbica simples. Esses sistemas são caracterizados pela existência de superfícies delimitadoras, filmes finos e super-redes, ou apenas o {{interior}} do material (bulk). Portanto, a interação de troca, entre os primeiros vizinhos, depende da posição dos átomos na rede: com a existência de superfícies temos para átomos nesses planos, interações de troca Js e nos planos adjacentes (bulk) interação J. Estudamos as propriedades termodinâmicas do metamagneto quântico para a rede cúbica simples. O limite de estabilidade da fase antiferromagnética é apresentada para o estado fundamental (T = 0) e os respectivos diagramas de fases são analisados. Com a escolha de uma interação entreplanos diferente da existente nos planos (interplanos), parâmetro &# 955; (interação &# 955;J), analisamos a influência da mudança na dimensionalidade [quase - 2 d(&# 955; = 10 - 5) &# 8594; 3 d(&# 955; = 1. 0) ] do sistema nas propriedades termodinâmicas com o surgimento de uma anomalia na susceptibilidade magnética total. O efeito de superfície nas propriedades termodinâmicas é tratado tomando o sistema por um filme fino de tamanho l(no de camadas), com interações de troca F e AF, onde nesse último aplicamos um campo externo. Observamos o comportamento do filme fino em função da temperatura, número de camadas, campo magnético e a razão Js/J. Fazendo variar a interação de troca entre os constituintes e as camadas do filme fino, caracterizamos o sistema como uma super-rede magnética. Escolhemos quatro arranjos na construção das super-redes: interações ferromagnética diferentes nos planos e entreplanos, o mesmo para AF, alternando as camadas entre F e AF e um sistema cuja metade das camadas têm interação F e a outra metade AF, onde observamos a influência da mudança da interação de troca nas propriedades termodinâmicas e na criticalidade. Vários fenômenos foram observados, como por exemplo, oscilação nas magnetizações e susceptibilidade por camadas para certos valores da temperatura e parâmetros de acoplamento. In {{this work}} {{we will study}} through the differential operator technique the surface effect in anisotropic spin quantum Heisenberg model, through theory of effective field (EFT), of a two-spins cluster, in case of simple cubic lattice. Those systems are characterized by {{the existence of the}} surfaces, thin films and superlattice, or the bulk. Therefore, the exchange interaction, among the nearest-neighboring, depends on the position of the atoms in the lattice: with the existence of surfaces we have for atoms in those plans, exchange interactions Js and in the adjacent plans interaction J. We studied the thermodynamic properties of the quantum metamagnet for the simple cubic lattice. The limit of stability of the phase antiferromagnetic is presented for the ground state (T = 0) and the respective diagrams of phases are analyzed. With the choice of the interlayer coupling interaction different from the existent in the plane (interplane), parameter &# 955; (interaction &# 955;J), we analyzed the influence of the crossover in the dimensionality [2 d(&# 955; = 10 - 5) &# 8594; 3 d(&# 955; = 1. 0) ] of the system in the thermodynamic properties with the appearance of an anomaly in magnetic susceptibility. The surface effect in the thermodynamic properties is treated taking the system on thickness <b>film</b> <b>l,</b> with exchange interactions F and AF, where in that last one we applied an external field. We observed the behavior of the thin film in function of the temperature, number of layers, magnetic field and the ratio Js/J. Changing the exchange interaction between the elements and the layers of the thin film, we characterized the system as a magnetic superlattice. We chose four arrangements {{in the construction of the}} superlattice: different inter and interlayer ferromagnetic (F) interaction, the same for antiferromagnetic (AF), alternating the layers among F, and alternating superlattice composed of F (with l 1 layers) and AF (with l 2 layers), where l = l 1 + l 2 is the thickness of the film, where we observed the influence of the change of the exchange interaction in the thermodynamic properties and in the critical properties. Several phenomena were observed, as for instance, oscillation in the magnetizations and susceptibility for layers in certain values of the temperature and coupling parameters...|$|E
40|$|The band {{structure}} of the most representative collective modes in four different permalloy/cobalt periodic systems consisting of cylindrical cobalt (Co) nanodots etched into a continuous permalloy (Py) film are studied. The investigation is performed according to a micromagnetic approach, called dynamical matrix method (DMM), generalized to study the dynamical properties of periodic binary magnetic systems and the eigenvalue problem is recast {{in the form of}} a complex generalized Hermitian problem. An external magnetic field H having intensity H = 500 Oe is applied along the y -axis and the Bloch wave vector K is along the x -axis. The lattice constant is a = 600 nm, the Co circular nanodot has a diameter d = 310 nm and the thickness is L = 16 nm for every system. The Co circular dot is totally embedded into the Py film only in system 1. In system 2 it is partially embedded into Py film with a thickness L Co = 8 nm. In system 3 the thickness of the Co circular nanodot is L Co = 16 nm, but it is etched only 8 nm into Py film, while in system 4 it is above the Py <b>film</b> (<b>L</b> Co = 8 nm). The binary ferromagnetic systems studied are twodimensional periodic, but they can be regarded as three-dimensional, since the magnetization is non uniform also along the z direction due to the contrast between the saturation magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic materials along the thickness. Magnonic modes have Damon- Eshbach-like (DE) character with nodal planes parallel to the local direction of the magnetization. According to the mode classification, we denote the two families of collective modes with DEn BZ and DEn BZHR with n = 1, 2, [...] . labeling the n th Brillouin zone. The DEn BZHR modes are mainly localized along the horizontal rows (HRs) containing Co cylindrical nanodots with a much lower degree of localization in the Co cylindrical nanodots, but their amplitude can be rather large also along the horizontal channels. Instead, the DEn BZ modes have amplitudes spreading mainly inside the Py film with maxima in the horizontal channel, but with appreciable amplitude also in the horizontal rows containing cobalt cylindrical dots. The dispersion curves of magnonic modes for system 2 are slightly downshifted with respect to the corresponding ones calculated for system 1. The same behavior is exhibited by dispersion of system 4 compared to that of system 3. This small downshift of the dispersion is due to larger demagnetizing effects on mode frequencies. The surface magnetic charges created by the static magnetizations are of opposite sign, but of different magnitude at the interface between Py and Co leading to the formation of effective “surface magnetic charges” that take the sign of the ones due to MCo. As a result, the static demagnetizing field is parallel to H in the Py horizontal channels and antiparallel to in the Co cylindrical nanodots and in the HRs. Also band gaps (BGs) appearing at edges of n BZs with n = 1, 2, [...] are determined up to the 5 th BZ. For both families of collective modes the BG amplitude is about 0. 5 GHz at the border of the 1 BZ. We have found that the perturbation which produces the band gaps is proportional to the quantity of Co which acts like a BG resonator. A quantitative comparison with band gaps estimated via an analytical method based on a perturbation approach is also performed. According to this approach it is assumed that the unperturbed collective mode frequencies of the lower bands are perturbed by the demagnetizing field created by the Co cylindrical dots. Band gaps calculated with DMM are also compared with the ones determined by means of an approximated version of another analytical approach called the plane wave method. It is also shown that the interchange between Co and Py does not lead in all cases to an interchange of the corresponding mode dispersion. This is in turn due to the demagnetizing effects that are different in every system investigated. In every system, localized modes minaly along HRs have their largest amplitude in the regions filled by Py. The degree of localization of localized modes is expressed by means of a concentration factor in analogy to electromagnetic waves in two-dimensionale photonic crystals. The obtained results could stimulate the reseach on technological applications for tailoring {{band structure}} in magnonic crystals in a way similar to what was done for electronic and photonic crystals.
