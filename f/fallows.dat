The improved <b>fallow</b> system involved maintaining "Calopogonium mucunoides", seeded into a natural bush <b>fallow</b> for 2 years before planting to rice. With no chemical fertilizer application, which reflects farmers' practice in the area, average grain yield for continuous rice (1, 185 kg/ha) and the cropping sequence incorporating a natural bush <b>fallow</b> (1, 175 kg/ha) did not differ, but were higher for the improved <b>fallow</b> system (1, 304 kg/ha). This suggests that nutrient contribution from the leguminous cover crop made up for critical crop N requirements in the improved <b>fallow.</b> Stochastic dominance of grain yield distributions from the improved <b>fallow</b> system, relative {{to the other two}} cropping systems, was more dramatic with no N fertilizer application compared to treatments with 30 kg/ha N. Average returns were highest for the improved <b>fallow</b> system, followed by the natural bush fallow-cropping system, and then continuous rice, under the no N fertilizer treatment regime. With 30 kg/ha N fertilizer, income risk efficiency was less clear (compared to treatments with no N fertilizer), especially between continuous rice and the improved <b>fallow</b> treatment, because of faster N mineralization effects on continuous rice. In contrast, the improved cover crop <b>fallow</b> system completely dominated the natural bush <b>fallow</b> treatment under both fertilizer regimes.

40|$|In Washington, {{over fifty}} percent of the wheat {{produced}} under rainfed conditions receives less than 300 mm of annual precipitation. Hence, a winter wheat-summer <b>fallow</b> cropping system has been adopted to obtain adequate moisture for winter wheat production. Current tilled <b>fallow</b> systems are exposed to significant soil degradation from wind and water erosion. As a result, late-planted no-till <b>fallow</b> systems are being evaluated to mitigate erosion concerns. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate current cultivars under late-planted no-till <b>fallow</b> systems to identify whether current breeding schemes in tilled <b>fallow</b> systems could select productive cultivars in late-planted no-till <b>fallow</b> systems. Thirty cultivars were planted in a split-plot design with <b>fallow</b> type as the main plot and genotype as the sub-plot. <b>Fallow</b> types evaluated were a tilled <b>fallow</b> system and a late planted no-till <b>fallow</b> system. Data were collected on heading date, plant height, grain volume weight, grain yield, and grain protein content. Analysis of variance was conducted on data across locations. Results were significant for all traits except for grain protein content. The late-planted no-till <b>fallow</b> system headed 16 days later was 5 cm shorter, yielded 36 % less, and had a grain volume weight 3 % less than the tilled <b>fallow</b> system. The lower yield and grain volume weight potential is hypothesized to be due to the 16 day delay in heading date leading to warmer temperatures during grain fill and a shorter duration. In order to breed wheat to be highly productive under a late-planted no-till <b>fallow</b> system, directly selecting in this system for early spring growth and earlier heading dates will be essential.

However, the ability of long <b>fallowing</b> for soil water conservation has been questioned in some dryland regions including Central Aragon. This research was aimed to quantify soil water losses (E), soil water storage (SWS) and precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) of long <b>fallow</b> under three management systems (conventional tillage, CT; reduced tillage, RT; no-tillage, NT). The PSE of long <b>fallow</b> relative to short <b>fallow</b> (5 - 6 months) was also evaluated. Over four experimental years (1999 - 2002), soil water balance for both short and long <b>fallow</b> periods was calculated from <b>fallow</b> seasonal precipitation and volumetric soil water content (0 - 70 cm depth). During long <b>fallowing,</b> primary tillage implemented in CT and RT plots induced significant E losses from the plough layer for the first 24 h after tillage. However, secondary tillage under CT and RT appeared to have a positive effect on soil water conservation at the end of <b>fallow.</b> Despite a different soil water dynamics among treatments, total E at the end of <b>fallow</b> was similar for the three <b>fallow</b> management systems. The partitioning of long <b>fallow</b> into three sub-periods showed that the early phase (July-November) was the most efficient in terms of SWS, having the lowest average daily evaporation rate (Er) per day (0. 65 mm day- 1). The overwinter period (December-May) and the late period (June- November) had greater Er values (0. 93 and 1. 09 mm day- 1, respectively) and variable SWS as a function of rainfall pattern in those periods. In general, PSE, either for the <b>fallow</b> phases or the entire <b>fallow</b> period, increased when most of seasonal effective rainfalls ( 10 mm day- 1) were received in the last two months of each period.

500|$|As {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} Tsar's {{execution}} approached in July 1928, Botkin retained a lawyer, Edward <b>Fallows,</b> to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar's estate outside of the Soviet Union. As {{the death of the}} Tsar had never been proved, the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death. <b>Fallows</b> set up a company, called the Grandanor Corporation (an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia), which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate.

Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany, distributed to the Tsar's recognized relations, no money was ever found. After a quarrel, possibly over Tschaikovsky's claim to the estate (but not over her claim to be Anastasia), Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds' mansion, and the pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff arranged for her to live at the Garden City Hotel in Hempstead, New York, and later in a small cottage.

Here, we compared biomass and nutrient stocks under three <b>fallow</b> management strategies: (1) natural <b>fallow</b> (regrowth vegetation) - NF; (2) NF vegetation improved with leguminous trees (Sclerolobium paniculatum Vogel and Inga edulis Mart.) - IF; and (3) NF vegetation improved with leguminous trees plus phosphorus fertilization - IF+P. We quantified above- and belowground biomass and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg stocks after 23 months of <b>fallow.</b> The IF+P increased aboveground (leaf + branch + stem + liana) biomass and N, P, Ca, and Mg stocks, compared to NF. Similarly, total (aboveground + belowground) biomass and N and P stocks were higher for IF+P than for NF. The differences in aboveground biomass between NF and improved <b>fallow</b> managements were attributed exclusively to the contribution of the tree species enriching <b>fallow</b> vegetation.
