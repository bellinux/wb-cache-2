500|$|Developer Ryan Lambourn {{created a}} flash game called V-Tech Rampage in 2007, which allows players {{to control the}} actions of gunman Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech massacre. Lambourn professed empathy for Cho, {{and said that he}} was a target of {{bullying}} in high school. [...] "No one listens to you unless you've got something sensational to do. And that's why I feel sympathy for Cho Seung-Hui. He had to go that far," [...] Lambourn stated. On the V-Tech Rampage site, Lambourn posted a statement that he would take the game off of Newgrounds if donations reached $1000; at $2000 in donations he would take the game down from the main site and for another $1000 he would apologize for creating it. Ledonne posted a comment on Lambourn's website after V-Tech Rampage drew comparisons to Super Columbine Massacre, calling Lambourn's statement tantamount to a [...] "hostage note", and asking bloggers to consider [...] "not whether a game about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made but <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> go about making a game that accomplishes more than V-Tech Rampage does with the subject matter." [...] Ledonne stated that he emailed Lambourn sympathetically, but that the creator responded to his emails with profanity; he reiterated that the two games had different motivations and were not easily comparable in content.|$|E

2500|$|The International Men's Day {{theme for}} 2015 — [...] "Working To Expand Reproductive Options for Men" [...] — is {{designed}} to encourage cooperation in addressing reproductive issues that affect men and boys around the world, such as family planning, men's reproductive choices, sexual health, and safe sexual practices. The question is asked of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> improve men's freedom to choose parenthood, without infringing on the reproductive rights of women, through cultural, legal, technological and educational avenues.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, {{it is by}} the {{application}} of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says [...] "these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur". Parallel processing helps explain <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> experience a sort of contra-causal free will even if it were determined.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Ludford MEP {{called for}} the British Government {{to change the law}} {{in the wake of the}} Mote case, {{explaining}} that the European Parliament had been powerless to intervene in the case as Mote's eligibility as an MEP was solely a question of UK law. She expressed the sentiment that [...] "MEPs are deeply unhappy at our inability to chuck out Mr Mote." [...] The Commons Leader Harriet Harman shared these concerns and said that she was [...] "in discussions regarding <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> explore options for reviewing the legislation", adding that [...] "he aim of this would be to ensure that, in future, the salaries of MPs and MEPs who are in prison would not be paid on the basis that they are not actually carrying out all their functions." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 2 June 2016, USAF {{spokesman}} Maj. Rob Leese confirmed that, {{while the}} Air Force's KC-46 contract with Boeing {{does not contain}} any pre-defined penalties for schedule delays. Not delivering the 18 certified tankers by August 2017 is a contract schedule breach. [...] "The Air Force will secure consideration from Boeing {{as part of the}} schedule re-baseline that is about to commence following the RRA delay announcement." [...] On 12 July 2016, Frank Kendall, US Defense Acquisitions Chief, confirmed that the tanker program office was analyzing the likely costs for the service arising from the delay. [...] "The government is losing some of the value that we have contracted for, so we are entitled to some consideration for that. The program office has several ideas for <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> do that, and they’re talking to Boeing." [...] The USAF would incur additional costs were it necessary to operate the KC-135 fleet for longer than planned.|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar {{called a}} meeting of {{principal}} parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. [...] "After several years of review, {{it is now time}} to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That is why I am gathering the principal parties together next week to consider the findings of the Keeper and to discuss <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> find a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources. [...] I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take it slow and easy {{and see if we can}} live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
