If they are constructed in local, the industries can utilize them commonly and easily. As the machines are designed and constructed {{in accordance with the}} desired products, the quality of products is higher and the products can be used efficiently. In the study of Design and Construction of <b>Induction</b> <b>Hardening</b> <b>Machine,</b> the design of work coil is presented. A small model <b>induction</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>machine</b> is designed for the output power 5 kW and operation frequency 35 kHz. As the work coil {{is the heart of the}} machine, a good coil design reduces power requirement and causes good efficiency. The design of work coil that causes the most magnetic flux density in the work piece, the least power consumption and develops desired heat during limited time is studied.

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>hardening</b> {{is a key}} {{manufacturing}} process {{in the production of}} ductile iron automotive camshafts. Its desirable features include low-cost, a wear-resistant surface, and ease of manufacturing. Due to the asymmetrical geometry of the camshaft, <b>induction</b> <b>hardening</b> generates non-uniform heating/cooling which leads to a variability in both the microstructure of the surface hardened case, principally the amount of retained austenite (RA), and the level of residual stress (RS). Both RA and RS can affect the contact fatigue performance of the camshaft. In the present study, automotive camshafts containing six lobes per camshaft were <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> to different schedules and the RA and RS (surface) variations were determined both between different lobes on the same camshaft and between camshafts that were <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> to different schedules.

Because of their low cost and ease of testing, we have also used optical metallographic methods to determine RA. A correlation was obtained between the RA values obtained by x-ray diffraction with those obtained by optical metallography. This data for ductile iron expands the database that was available for steels to higher carbon-content ferrous alloys. Finally, a correlation is made between RA content and RS level in order to define a robust process window...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the need for Surface Hardening in Crankshafts and establishing <b>Induction</b> <b>Hardening</b> as the most practically viable process for the same. Crankshaft is one of the largest components in the internal combustion engine that has a complex geometry consisting of cylinders as bearings and plates as the crank webs. Geometry section changes in the crankshaft cause stress concentration at fillet areas where bearings are connected to the crank webs. In addition, this component experiences both torsional and bending load during its service life. The crankshaft must be capable of withstanding the intermittent variable loads impressed on it. The principal purpose of Surface Hardening is to increase the hardness, wear resistance and endurance limit of the surfaces of metal components. The core remains tough and can withstand impact loads. Prior to the advent of <b>Induction</b> <b>Hardening</b> methods such as furnace hardening, flame hardening and liquid nitriding were used.
