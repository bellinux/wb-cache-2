50|$|Dark slope streaks are albedo features. They {{appear to}} the eye as a {{brightness}} difference between the streak and the lighter-toned background slope. Usually no topographic relief is visible to distinguish the streak from its surroundings, except in the very highest resolution (<1 m/pixel) images. In many cases, the original surface texture of the slope is preserved and continuous across the streak, as though unaffected by events involved in dark streak formation (pictured left). The overall effect is equivalent in appearance to a partial shadow cast down the sloping surface. These observations indicate that whatever process forms the streaks, it affects only the very thinnest layer at the surface. Slope streaks are only about 10% darker than their surroundings but often appear black in images because the contrast has been enhanced (stretched). Albedo features cover the Martian surface at {{a wide variety of}} scales. They make up the classical light and dark marking seen on Mars through telescopes. (See Classical albedo features on Mars.) The markings are caused by differing proportions of dust covering the surface. Martian dust is bright reddish ochre in color, while the bedrock and soil (regolith) is dark gray (the color of unaltered basalt). Thus, dusty areas on Mars appear bright (high albedo), and surfaces with a high percentage of rocks and rock fragments are generally dark (low albedo). Most albedo features on Mars are caused by winds, which clear some areas of dust, leaving behind a darker lag. In other areas, dust is deposited to produce a bright surface. The selective removal and <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> is most conspicuous around impact craters and other obstacles where a variety of streaks (wind tails) and blotches are formed.|$|E

In addition to this "rapidly released" iron, offline calculations were also carried out to estimate the amount of bioavailable iron leached during the residence time <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> in the ocean mixed layer.

40|$|Salinisation of {{the shallow}} {{groundwater}} system has occurred coincident {{with the development}} of irrigation in the Coleambally Irrigation Area. Salinisation in irrigation areas has previously been attributed to the evaporative concentration of the water table; however, there are other sources of salt such as the accumulation of rainfall by vegetation and the dry <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> salt-laden <b>dusts.</b> A significant store of crystalline gypsum, together with high concentrations of Na, Mg and Confidence limit, was found within the previously unsaturated zone of the Upper Shepparton Formation. The salt store was identified both within and outside of the groundwater mound; therefore evaporative concentration of the water table cannot be the source of salt. The transition from regional groundwater quality, as applied as irrigation to the ground surface, to shallow groundwater quality is simply explained by solubilisation of this salt store in the presence of soil CO 2. Dating of basal palaeochannel sands indicates that the identified salt store, a profile of only 20 m, was accumulated during the last glacial cycle. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the peak in eluate salinity, at approximately 2 m below ground surface, is between 15, 000 and 25, 000 years old, coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum. The Last Glacial Maximum was a period of significantly enhanced aridity on the Australian continent. It was also found that the peak in eluate salinity coincided with a bi-modal particle size distribution.

40|$|The {{effect of}} rock {{fragment}} eccentricity on the deposition of airborne dust was examined in a wind tunnel. Eccentricity {{was defined as}} the ratio a/b, where a is the longest and b the intermediate axis of the rock fragments. The effect of eccentricity on the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> on the pebbles, on the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> between and underneath the pebbles, and on total dust deposition (pebbles + interpebble space) was measured separately, and this for different values of pebble size, pebble flattening, cover density and wind speed. The more pebbles are elongated, the larger dust deposition on them will be. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become larger, as they become less flattened, and as wind speed increases, but no correlation is observed with cover density. It also holds that the more pebbles are elongated, the less dust settles between and underneath them. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become smaller and cover density becomes larger, but there is no relationship with pebble flattening. Whether or not there is a relationship with wind speed is unclear. Pebble eccentricity indirectly influences total dust deposition on a pebble field, since it determines whether or not (and to what extent) total dust deposition will be a function of pebble size. For circular pebbles, total dust deposition is independent of pebble size, but once pebbles become elongated, total dust deposition will be smaller on pebble fields composed of small pebbles than on pebble fields composed of large pebbles. It was also demonstrated that the more pebbles are elongated, the more the dust will tend to settle on the pebbles rather than between or underneath them. Air flow separation plays a primary role in the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> on a rock fragment field, since it determines the location and size of the low-sedimentation areas that are connected to the air flow separation bubbles. Highly-elongated pebbles oriented parallel to the wind catch much more dust (also per unit surface) than circular pebbles, the surface of which is largely located in a zone of very low deposition. Dust deposition density on highly-elongated pebbles normal to the wind, on the contrary, is equal to dust deposition on circular pebbles. It should be noted that all data in this study refer to initial dust deposition (not accumulation), since only wind velocities below the dust deflation threshold were tested. status: publishe...|$|E

It is observed that about 40 % of the global land area and 30 % of the earth's population lives in semiarid environments which are especially susceptible to wind erosion and airborne transport of contaminants. With the increased desertification caused by land use changes, anthropogenic activities and projected climate change impacts windblown dust will likely become more significant. An important anthropogenic source <b>of</b> windblown <b>dust</b> in this region is associated with mining operations including tailings impoundments. Tailings are especially susceptible to erosion due to their fine grain composition, lack of vegetative coverage and high height compared to the surrounding topography. This study is focused on emissions, dispersion and <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> windblown <b>dust</b> from the Iron King mine tailings in Dewey-Humboldt, Arizona, a Superfund site. The tailings impoundment is heavily contaminated with lead and arsenic and is located directly adjacent {{to the town of}} Dewey-Humboldt. The study includes in situ field measurements, computational fluid dynamic modeling and the development <b>of</b> a windblown <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> forecasting model that predicts <b>deposition</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> originating from the tailings impoundment. Two instrumented eddy flux towers were setup on the tailings impoundment to monitor the aeolian and meteorological conditions. The in situ observations were used in conjunction with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model to simulate the transport <b>of</b> windblown <b>dust</b> from the mine tailings to the surrounding region. The CFD model simulations include gaseous plume dispersion to simulate the transport of the fine aerosols, while individual particle transport was used to track the trajectories of larger particles and to monitor their deposition locations. The CFD simulations were used to estimate <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> tailings <b>dust</b> and identify topographic mechanisms that influence deposition. Simulation results indicated that particles preferentially deposit in regions of topographic upslope. In addition, turbulent wind fields enhanced deposition in the wake region downwind of the tailings. This study also describes a deposition forecasting model (DFM) {{that can be used to}} forecast the {{transport and}} <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> windblown <b>dust</b> originating from a mine tailings impoundment. The DFM uses in situ observations from the tailings and theoretical simulations of aerosol transport to parameterize the model.

The deposition forecasting model was initialized using data from an operational Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the forecast deposition patterns were compared to the inverted-disc samples through gravimetric, chemical composition and lead isotopic analysis.

Results from the sampling periods indicated that the DFM was able to accurately capture the regional <b>deposition</b> patterns <b>of</b> the tailings <b>dust</b> up to 1 km.

The four observation-based methods yield a monthly average <b>deposition</b> flux <b>of</b> mineral <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> 12 – 29 ng m − 2 s − 1. The simulation results come close to the upper range of the measurements with an average value of 47 ng m − 2 s − 1. It is shown that the mass <b>deposition</b> flux <b>of</b> mineral <b>dust</b> obtained by the combination of micrometeorological (ultra-sonic anemometer) and microphysical measurements (particle mass size distribution <b>of</b> mineral <b>dust)</b> is difficult to compare to modeled mass deposition fluxes when the mineral dust is inhomogeneously distributed over the investigated area...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} gas {{contains}} plenty <b>of</b> <b>dust,</b> which deposits easily {{on the bottom of}} seat sealing surface of the tri-eccentric butterfly valve in the pipeline, causing stuck and damage to the valve plate, thereby affects the production of the blast furnace and brings great economic loss. To derive the influence mechanism of effects of the {{blast furnace gas}} flow speed within the pipeline on the dust deposition laws in the butterfly valve region, a 3 D model of the butterfly valve and its regional flow field is built with Pro/E software. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, along with standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of moving trajectories <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles in butterfly valve region under 3 blast furnace gas flow speeds is conducted. Results show that the <b>deposition</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles decreases firstly, then increases with the enlargement of valve plate opening angle under the blast furnace gas flow speed of 8 m/s, while decreases with the enlargement of valve plate opening under the blast furnace gas flow speeds of 12 m/s and 16 m/s. In the case of the valve plate opening angle of 15 °, the <b>deposition</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles increases with the growing of blast furnace gas flow speed, while decreases with the growing of blast furnace gas flow speed under the cases of valve plate opening angle of 45 ° and 75 °. The research results provide a theoretical reference for the development <b>of</b> automatic <b>dust</b> removal system in the butterfly valve region of the blast furnace gas pipeline...|$|R
