The 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) / 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (<b>TPA)</b> -induced <b>skin</b> <b>papilloma</b> model depends on proinflammatory processes, whereas the 3 ′-methylcholanthrene (MCA) induction of fibrosarcoma {{has been used by}} tumor immunologists to illustrate innate and adaptive immune surveillance of cancer. When exposed to a combination of DMBA/TPA, mice lacking MyD 88 formed fewer <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> than genetically matched WT controls treated in a similar manner. Unexpectedly, however, fewer MyD 88 −/− mice formed sarcomas than WT controls when exposed to MCA. In contrast, MyD 88 -deficient mice did not show a defective ability to reject highly immunogenic transplanted tumors, including MCA sarcomas. Despite the reported role of TNF in chronic inflammation, TNF-deficient mice were significantly more susceptible to MCA-induced sarcoma than WT mice. Overall, these data not only confirm the key role that MyD 88 plays in promoting tumor development but also demonstrate that inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and cancer immunoediting can indeed occur in the same mouse tumor model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> arise as {{a result}} of clonal {{expansion}} of mutant cells. It has been proposed that the expansion of pretumoral cell clones is propelled not only by the increased proliferation capacity of mutant cells, but also by active cell selection. Previous studies in Drosophila describe a clonal selection process mediated by the Flower (Fwe) protein, whereby cells that express certain Fwe isoforms are recognized and forced to undergo apoptosis. It was further shown that knock down of fwe expression in Drosophila can prevent the clonal expansion of dMyc-overexpressing pretumoral cells. Here, we study the function of the single predicted mouse homolog of Drosophila Fwe, referred to as mFwe, by clonal overexpression of mFwe isoforms in Drosophila and by analyzing mFwe knock-out mice. We show that clonal overexpression of certain mFwe isoforms in Drosophila also triggers non-autonomous cell death, suggesting that Fwe function is evolutionarily conserved. Although mFwe-deficient mice display a normal phenotype, they develop a significantly lower number of <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> upon exposure to DMBA/TPA two-stage skin carcinogenesis than do treated wild-type and mFwe heterozygous mice. Furthermore, mFwe expression is higher in papillomas and the papilloma-surrounding skin of treated wild-type mice compared with the skin of untreated wild-type mice.

Implantation of a slow releasing tamoxifen pellet into 18 mice consistently led to papilloma formation, of which only one progressed to a malignant SCC.

40|$|The {{development}} of malignant tumors in carcinogen-treated mouse skin appears to involve several genetic changes. Genetic changes which initiate the process {{are believed to}} induce alterations in the normal pattern of epidermal differentiation, resulting {{in the formation of}} benign tumors, i. e., epidermal papillomas. Subsequent changes appear to be required for the malignant conversion of papillomas to epidermal, squamous-cell carcinomas. Activation of the rasHa gene occurs frequently in chemically induced benign <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> as well as squamous cell carcinomas and thus may represent one mechanism to achieve the initiation step. In the present study, we analyzed several cell lines derived from chemically induced mouse <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> for the presence of transforming oncogenes by transfection of their DNA into NIH 3 T 3 cells. These papilloma cell lines exhibit an altered differentiation program, i. e., the ability to proliferate under culture conditions favoring terminal differentiation.

However, when the EJ rasHa gene was introduced into three of the papilloma cell lines by DNA transfection, transfectants showed an enhanced capacity to proliferate under differentiating culture conditions and formed rapidly growing, anaplastic carcinomas in nude mice.

40|$|Rabbit papillomas {{developing}} on {{the skin}} {{as the result of}} virus inoculation can be readily transferred to the inner organs of favorable hosts by implanting bits of the living tissue. The growths thus produced proliferate actively as a rule and frequently cause death. Often they are markedly invasive and destructive; and they tend to recur after excision. Bacterial infection may greatly enhance their malignancy. Accidental dissemination may occur during operation, and distribution to the peritoneal surface has been repeatedly noted. There may be no cellular reaction whatever about the invading epithelium of interior growths, but usually some new formation of connective tissue takes place, its amount varying inversely with the rate of epithelial proliferation. An immediate reason exists for the inflammatory changes and scarring found beneath long-established <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas,</b> in the trauma and secondary infection to which the projecting, necrotizing masses have been subjected. In animals dying of progressively enlarging interior growths the <b>skin</b> <b>papilloma</b> may long have been stationary in size. The growths appearing after the transfer of papillomatous tissue to the inner organs are due to the survival and multiplication of transplanted cells. However, the virus can be readily recovered from them, in the case of wild rabbits. No distinctive changes in the blood of the host have been found. The virus itself is highly specific for the epithelium of the skin, failing to act not only upon that of the other organs thus far tested but even upon embryonic <b>skin.</b> The <b>papilloma</b> frequently penetrates into the blood and lymph vessels, especially at the edge of implantation growths. The intravascular injection of fragments of it sometimes results in pulmonary nodules of characteristic morphology. These are due to survival and proliferation of the injected cells.

The second step, promotion, involves repetitive topical application of phorbol esters or wounding, leading to epidermal hyperproliferation and papilloma formation. We have found that overexpression of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) in the basal epidermal layer of transgenic mice yielded papillomas directly upon wounding or 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate treatment without the need for an initiator. Moreover, papillomas from TGF-alpha mice did not exhibit mutations in the Ha-ras gene. Interestingly, TGF-alpha acted synergistically with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate to enhance epidermal hyperproliferation. Our results demonstrate a central role for TGF-alpha overexpression in tumorigenesis and provide an important animal model for the study of skin tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Two {{proprietary}} semi-permanent hair dyes {{were tested}} for carcino-genicity in A and DBAf mice by repeated topical applications in aqueous acetone. Mice of both strains developed lymphoid tumours but experimental differences were marked only in DBAf mice. A number of tumours of the ovary and uterus, and some <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> near the penis, occurred in dye-treated {{but not in}} control DBAf mice. As many hair-dye constituents are known mutagens, adequate carcinogenicity test-ing of these substances, and epidemiological study of exposed human populations, are needed for evaluating possible health hazards from hair dyeing. EXISTING methods for carcinogenicity testing of chemicals in animals are slow and expensive,-and quite impracticable for monitoring {{the large numbers of}} new and existing environmental chemicals. There is consequently great current interest in various short-term assays that, thoug...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{influence}} of age-dependent alterations in non-skin tissues on chemical carcinogen-induced <b>skin</b> <b>papilloma</b> de-velopment was studied by treatment with 7, 12 -dimethylbenz-[a]anthracene (DMBA) of 4 -month-old skin grafts sewed onto 4 -and 20 -month-old syngeneic recipients. Skin of 4 - and 20 -month-old BALB/c female mice differed in susceptibility to DMBA car-cinogenesis, but the 4 -month-old grafts showed the same papil-loma incidence {{independent of the}} age of the recipient mice. In a different experiment, the {{influence of}} age of skin grafts on papil-loma development on DMBA-treated recipient skin was studied. Fourteen- and 26 -month-old skin grafts were carried by 14 -month-old recipients. Grafts of those two ages are known to differ in susceptibility to DMBA carcinogenesis, but no effect of the grafts on papilloma development on DMBA-treated recipients was de-tectable. It was concluded that certain age-dependent differ...|$|R

(1963) {{reported}} that Swiss mice receiving urethane as a subcutaneous injection at birth (1 mg. /g. body weight) followed by twice weekly applications of croton oil, starting at forty days, developed <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas.</b> The tumour incidence was {{significantly greater than}} that in mice given urethane or croton oil only, and that in mice given an equivalent dose (on a body weight basis) of urethane at forty days and similar treatment with croton oil. Graffi, Scharsach and Heyer (1955) found that doses of 400 - 1200,ug. 9, 10 dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) effectively initiated the induction of skin tumours when given orally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally to adult mice. Croton oil, applied to the skin, was the promoter. Small doses of DMBA induce malignant lymphomas, lung adenomas and {{a wide variety of}} other tumours whe...|$|R
40|$|Progression of benign tumors to {{malignant}} {{cancer is}} critical since can cerous lesions {{are capable of}} metastatic spread and eventually causing death. Inhibitors of the conversion process, therefore, would likely be useful as cancer chemopreventive agents. In this study, we assessed the protective effect of topical application of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea (GTP) against spontaneous as well as benzoyl peroxide llil'Ol- and 4 -nitroquinoline-A'"Oxide (4 -NQO) -enhanced malignant con version of chemically induced <b>skin</b> <b>papillomas</b> in SENCAR mice. Papillo mas were induced in SENCAR mice by topical application of 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene as a tumor-initiating agent followed by twice a week application of 12 - 0 -tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate as a tumor-promot ing agent. Beginning at the 20 th week, when papilloma yield was stabi lized, enhanced malignant conversion was achieved by twice weekly top...|$|R
