5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, <b>Gastrulation</b> Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During <b>gastrulation,</b> {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
25|$|Wnt {{signaling}} and beta-catenin dependent {{gene expression}} plays {{a critical role}} during the formation of different body regions in the early embryo. Experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop mesoderm and initiate <b>gastrulation.</b> During the blastula and gastrula stages, Wnt as well as BMP and FGF pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the primitive streak (<b>gastrulation</b> and mesoderm formation) {{as well as the}} process of neurulation (central nervous system development).|$|E
25|$|A-type lamins {{are only}} {{expressed}} following <b>gastrulation.</b> Lamin A and C {{are the most}} common A-type lamins and are splice variants of the LMNA gene found at 1q21.|$|E
25|$|The heart {{derives from}} {{embryonic}} mesodermal germ-layer cells that differentiate after <b>gastrulation</b> into mesothelium, endothelium, and myocardium. Mesothelial pericardium forms the outer {{lining of the}} heart. The inner lining of the heart, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from endothelium.|$|E
25|$|During early development, the {{sea urchin}} embryo {{undergoes}} 10 cycles of cell division, {{resulting in a}} single epithelial layer enveloping a blastocoel. The embryo must then begin <b>gastrulation,</b> a multipart process which involves the dramatic rearrangement and invagination of cells to produce the three germ layers.|$|E
25|$|The embryo {{undergoes}} well-characterized morphogenetic movements during <b>gastrulation</b> {{and early}} development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), {{as well as}} extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.|$|E
25|$|During embryo {{development}} in mice, Cyr61 is highly {{expressed in the}} cardiovascular, skeletal, and neuronal systems. Cyr61 knockout mice are embryonic lethal due to defects in cardiac septal morphogenesis, deficient blood vessel formation in placenta, and compromised vascular integrity. In Xenopus laevis, Cyr61 is required for normal <b>gastrulation</b> and modulation of Wnt signaling.|$|E
25|$|In Xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, <b>gastrulation</b> does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates <b>gastrulation.</b> Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of antisense mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|E
25|$|Gurwitch {{was the son}} of a Jewish provincial lawyer: {{his family}} was artistic and {{intellectual}} and he decided to study medicine only after failing to gain a place studying painting. After research in the laboratory of Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer he began to specialise in embryology, publishing his first paper, on the biochemistry of <b>gastrulation,</b> in 1895. He graduated from Munich University in 1897, having studied under A.A. Boehm.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of <b>gastrulation</b> is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel. Primary mesenchyme cells, or PMCs, {{are located in the}} vegetal plate specified to become mesoderm. Prior to ingression, PMCs exhibit all the features of other epithelial cells that comprise the embryo. Cells of the epithelium are bound basally to a laminal matrix and apically to an extraembryonic matrix. The apical microvilli of these cells reach into the hyaline layer, a component of the extraembryonic matrix. Neighboring epithelial cells are also connected to each other through apical junctions, protein complexes containing adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, linked to catenins.|$|E
25|$|After {{fertilization}} of the oocyte, {{the early}} embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, <b>gastrulation</b> starts.|$|E
25|$|The {{time period}} for X-chromosome {{inactivation}} explains this disparity. Inactivation {{occurs in the}} epiblast during <b>gastrulation,</b> which {{gives rise to the}} embryo. Inactivation occurs on a cellular level, resulting in a mosaic expression, in which patches of cells have an inactive maternal X-chromosome, while other patches have an inactive paternal X-chromosome. For example, a female heterozygous for haemophilia (an X-linked disease) would have about half of her liver cells functioning properly, which is typically enough to ensure normal blood clotting. Chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cells; however, such statistical extremes are unlikely. Genetic differences on the chromosome may also render one X-chromosome more likely to undergo inactivation. Also, if one X-chromosome has a mutation hindering its growth or rendering it non viable, cells which randomly inactivated that X will have a selective advantage over cells which randomly inactivated the normal allele. Thus, although inactivation is initially random, cells that inactivate a normal allele (leaving the mutated allele active) will eventually be overgrown and replaced by functionally normal cells in which nearly all have the same X-chromosome activated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{understood}} that X-chromosome inactivation is a random process, occurring {{at about the}} time of <b>gastrulation</b> in the epiblast (cells that will give rise to the embryo). The maternal and paternal X chromosomes have an equal probability of inactivation. This would suggest that women would be expected to suffer from X-linked disorders approximately 50% as often as men (because women have two X chromosomes, while men have only one); however, in actuality, the occurrence of these disorders in females is much lower than that. One explanation for this disparity is that over 25% of genes on the inactivated X chromosome remain expressed, thus providing women with added protection against defective genes coded by the X-chromosome. Some suggest that this disparity must be proof of preferential (non-random) inactivation. Preferential inactivation of the paternal X-chromosome occurs in both marsupials and in cell lineages that form the membranes surrounding the embryo, whereas in placental mammals either the maternally or the paternally derived X-chromosome may be inactivated in different cell lines.|$|E
500|$|The fertilized eggs {{develop into}} larvae by {{dividing}} until {{there are enough}} cells to form a hollow sphere (blastula) and then a depression forms at one end (<b>gastrulation)</b> and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the animal pole), while in bilaterians it forms {{at the other end}} (vegetal pole). The larvae, called planulae, swim or crawl by means of cilia. They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the [...] "front" [...] end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.|$|E
2500|$|... "TGF" [...] (Transforming Growth Factor) is {{a family}} of {{proteins}} that includes 33 members that encode dimeric, secreted polypeptides that regulate development. Many developmental processes are under its control including <b>gastrulation,</b> axis symmetry of the body, organ morphogenesis, and tissue homeostasis in adults. All TGF-β ligands bind to either Type I or Type II receptors, to create heterotetramic complexes.|$|E
2500|$|Leo Buss in {{his book}} The Evolution of Individuality proposes {{that much of the}} {{evolution}} of development in animals reflects the conflict between selective pressures acting {{at the level of the}} cell and those acting at the level of the multicellular individual. [...] This perspective can shed new light on phenomena as diverse as <b>gastrulation</b> and germ line sequestration.|$|E
2500|$|In the embryo, the {{formation}} of the neural folds originates from the area where the neural plate and the surrounding ectoderm converge. This region of the embryo is formed after <b>gastrulation,</b> and consists of epithelial tissue. [...] Here, the epithelial cells elongate by means of microtubule polymerization, increasing their height. [...] The thumbnail below shows this process, as well as the subsequent formation of the neural crest cells and the neural tube, which arise from the joining of the neural folds.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{classical}} hypothesis of Marriosis De' Abrtona, derived {{from the results of}} the expedition of the famous British research vessel RRS Discovery, egg development then proceeds as follows: <b>gastrulation</b> (development of egg into embryo) sets in during the descent of the [...] eggs on the shelf at the bottom, in oceanic areas in depths around [...] The egg hatches as a nauplius larva; once this has moulted into a metanauplius, the young animal starts migrating towards the surface in a migration known as developmental ascent.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than just}} axonal guidance, Ephs have {{been implicated in}} the {{migration}} of neural crest cells during <b>gastrulation.</b> In the chick and rat embryo trunk, the migration of crest cells is partially mediated by EphB receptors. Similar mechanisms {{have been shown to}} control crest movement in the hindbrain within rhombomeres 4, 5, and 7, which distribute crest cells to brachial arches 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In C. elegans a knockout of the [...] vab-1 gene, known to encode an Eph receptor, and its Ephrin ligand vab-2 results in two cell migratory processes being affected.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>gastrulation,</b> {{neural crest}} cells are {{specified}} {{at the border}} of the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm. [...] During neurulation, the borders of the neural plate, also known as the neural folds, converge at the dorsal midline to form the neural tube. [...] Subsequently, neural crest cells from the roof plate of the neural tube undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, delaminating from the neuroepithelium and migrating through the periphery where they differentiate into varied cell types. [...] The emergence of neural crest was important in vertebrate evolution because many of its structural derivatives are defining features of the vertebrate clade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striking}} segmented {{pattern of}} the spine is established during embryogenesis when somites are rhythmically added to the posterior of the embryo. Somite formation begins around the third week when the embryo begins <b>gastrulation</b> and continues until around 52 somites are formed. The somites are spheres, formed from the paraxial mesoderm {{that lies at the}} sides of the neural tube and they contain the precursors of spinal bone, the vertebrae ribs and some of the skull, as well as muscle, ligaments and skin. Somitogenesis and the subsequent distribution of somites is controlled by a clock and wavefront model acting in cells of the paraxial mesoderm. Soon after their formation, sclerotomes, which give rise to some of the bone of the skull, the vertebrae and ribs, migrate, leaving the remainder of the somite now termed a dermamyotome behind. This then splits to give the myotomes which will form the muscles and dermatomes which will form the skin of the back. [...] Sclerotomes become subdivided into an anterior and a posterior compartment. This subdivision {{plays a key role in}} the definitive patterning of vertebrae that form when the posterior part of one somite fuses to the anterior part of the consecutive somite during a process termed resegmentation. Disruption of the somitogenesis process in humans results in diseases such as congenital scoliosis. So [...] far, the human homologues of three genes associated to the mouse segmentation clock, (MESP2, DLL3 and LFNG), have been shown to be mutated in cases of congenital scoliosis, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in vertebral segmentation are conserved across vertebrates. In humans the first four somites are incorporated in the base of the occipital bone of the skull and the next 33 somites will form the vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments and skin. The remaining posterior somites degenerate. During the fourth week of embryogenesis, the sclerotomes shift their position to surround the spinal cord and the notochord. This column of tissue has a segmented appearance, with alternating areas of dense and less dense areas.|$|E
