5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having been hit in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial volley of gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped down into the field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay supine on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tries to protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing {{against the side of}} a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E

25|$|On March 17, 1997, Hart {{was given}} a shot to regain the title against Sid in a steel cage and thus change the main event at WrestleMania. If Hart won, his match with Austin at WrestleMania would become a title match while if Sid won, the {{regularly}} scheduled title match pitting him against the Undertaker would go on as planned. Since their respective matches would be affected, both Undertaker and Austin interfered in the match with Austin trying to help Hart so he could wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Undertaker trying to help Sid so he could keep his championship opportunity. Sid won the match by escaping the cage after Undertaker slammed the door in Hart's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was trying to exit. While the steel cage was being dismantled, Vince McMahon attempted to interview Hart, but a furious Hart grabbed the microphone and shoved McMahon down the mat before yelling expletives at him.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2010, Miller, {{now using}} the ring name Heath Slater, {{was one of}} eight FCW wrestlers to compete on the first season of the new NXT show, with Christian as his storyline mentor. On the inaugural episode of NXT, Slater debuted as a <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> and Christian {{defeated}} Carlito and Michael Tarver in a tag team match. Two weeks later, Slater defeated Carlito, becoming the first NXT rookie to defeat a WWE pro. On the March 30 episode of NXT, he came fourth out of eight rookies in the first Pros' Poll. On the April 6 episode, Slater won a keg-carrying contest against all other rookies. This resulted in him being in the main event that night, a match against Kane, which he lost. In an upset victory on April 20, Slater defeated Chris Jericho in the main event of NXT. However, Slater remained at fourth in the second Pros Poll, revealed on May 11. He was eliminated from NXT on May 25, coming in last in the Pros' Poll.|$|E
25|$|After a {{backstage}} segment featuring Dorian Roldán, Jeff Jarrett, Karen Jarrett, Konnan and Kurt Angle, {{the fourth}} match {{of the event}} saw Joe Líder and Psicosis face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. Despite Psicosis announcing before the event that he would be betting his hair in case of a loss in the Parejas Suicidas match, it was announced that the match would be for Líder's hair and Psicosis' mask. However, before the match began, Líder attacked Psicosis and ripped his mask off, revealing his burned face and forcing the match to be changed to a Hair vs. Hair match. Towards the end of the hardcore brawl, Líder threw a garbage can into Psisocis' <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was climbing to the top rope. However, when Líder went to suplex his opponent back down to the ring, Psicosis countered the move and dropped him with a flip piledriver through a table and a ladder, both propped up against the corner, and then pinned him to win the match. Afterwards, Psicosis continued the assault on his rival, dropping him onto a pile of thumbtacks, before having him shaved bald. After getting backstage, Líder and Psicosis continued brawling in the locker room, before being broken up by security.|$|E

25|$|Mary {{is alone}} in the stable in Bethlehem with the baby Jesus when she {{receives}} a visitation from an angel. He tells the virgin {{that she has been}} permitted a glimpse of the future and shows Jesus alone and afraid in the Garden of Gethsemane as He prays before his arrest, then a vision of Jesus carrying His cross on the way to His crucifixion, and then finally on the cross as He is declared by the High Priest as a blasphemer. The angel offers Mary the choice of giving the baby back to God to avoid these agonies of the future and tells her that she should regard the choice as hers alone with no compunction from God himself. Mary suddenly remembers the smile on her son's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>He</b> looked on His sleeping disciples in Gethsemane and a similar look on the face of one of the criminals also on a cross at Golgotha. She refuses the offer that the angel makes to her. He vanishes as Joseph comes into the stable. The angel is then revealed to be Satan in disguised form who vows to come back one day and tempt Jesus himself. As he flashes through the sky towards hell, his passage is mistaken for a star by the Three Wise Men.|$|E

500|$|Sammy {{is given}} an unappealing {{character}} design and personality, with dull features and expression {{that do not}} invite the reader's sympathy; his character is never developed. [...] Similar to Buster Brown, Sammy dresses in a dress shirt, lace collar, and cravat. [...] This style associated with middle-class aspirations and popularized {{toward the end of}} the 19th century in the wake of the success of Little Lord Fauntleroy. [...] By the time Sammy Sneeze had begun the style was a subject of ridicule; in an age where respectable society went to lengths to avoid drawing attention to bodily functions, it emphasized the humorous contortions of Sammy's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> built up toward his sneeze. [...] His sneeze could also tear down other symbols of the middle-class, such as an expansive department store display of goods at Christmas.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] {{was written}} by Brown, Jean Baptiste, Benny Benassi and Alle Benassi, with the latter two also {{handling}} its production. It was recorded at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. Before the release of F.A.M.E., the song leaked online on January 16, 2011. The single cover was unveiled on February 2, 2011, showing Brown strapping a gas mask onto his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> peers up at the camera. The song's title is spelled out in ransom note effect, with Brown's name graffitied onto the bottom right corner. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was released for digital download on March 11, 2011. An extended play, featuring additional remixes of the song, was made available for download in the United Kingdom and the United States on April 19, 2011. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was later included on Benassi's fifth studio album, Electroman (2011), as track four.|$|E
500|$|After an {{individual}} ("the gardener") {{came forward with}} information, a small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30, 2005. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Van der Sloot attempting to hide his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> drove into the Racquet Club with the Kalpoe brothers on the very early morning of May 30 between 2:30a.m. and 3:00a.m. Nancy Grace described the gardener as [...] "the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open". Another person, [...] "the jogger", claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a landfill during the afternoon of May 30. The police had searched the landfill {{in the days following}} Holloway's disappearance. After the jogger's statements, the landfill was searched three more times; the FBI used cadaver dogs to assist in the recovery operation. The searches were fruitless.|$|E
500|$|... "Flesh and Stone" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews.

He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> realises {{he is going to}} have to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, we were left with more questions than answers and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E

500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw {{a cup of hot}} coffee in his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was walking down the street.|$|E
500|$|Co-written by Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] is {{a tribute}} to one of D'Angelo's primary influences, Prince, and evokes his early [...] The {{similarity}} of D'Angelo's music on Voodoo to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams's liner notes, as he stated [...] "I'd pay to see Prince's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> listens to this album." [...] Questlove described the song as [...] "finding the line between parody and honesty [...] In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout, which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and [...] "Maggot Brain" [...] sound. The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic. D'Angelo's vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses, all of which were sung by D'Angelo. The song's sexually explicit lyrics describe the narrator's plea to his lover for sex, as exemplified in the second verse: [...] "Love to make you wet/In between your thighs, cause/I love when it comes inside of you/I get so excited when I'm around you, baby" [...] It has been cited by critics as the album's best song.|$|E
500|$|Mayor McDaniels {{decides that}} {{anything}} offensive to anyone {{will be removed}} from the Christmas celebrations, including Santa Claus, Christmas trees, wreaths, fairy lights, candy canes, mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee.

500|$|Several {{scenes from}} the script were cut during filming, {{most of which were}} brief time lapses or {{transitioning}} scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Dr. Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be [...] "impatient". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Dr. Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Dr. Caligari first awakens Cesare, {{one of the most famous}} moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Dr. Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gradually opens his eyes. The original title cards for Caligari featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering.|$|E
500|$|The {{press was}} given an {{opportunity}} to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, [...] "an unqualified disaster". A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. The Sunday Times called the C5 a [...] "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter [...] "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything when phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule". The Guardians reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, while Your Computer found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: [...] "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive [...] "peep, peep" [...] noise signalling that the engine had overheated." [...] Even the distinguished former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that while he had started out well, [...] "a jaunty smile on [...] <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: [...] "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead.
