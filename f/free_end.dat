25|$|It was {{fashionable to}} pluck or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the <b>free</b> <b>end</b> being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E
25|$|With a penannular brooch, the pin {{is pushed}} through {{folds of the}} cloth, which are then pulled back inside the ring; the <b>free</b> <b>end</b> of the pin passes through {{the gap in the}} ring. The pin is then rotated around the ring by 90 degrees or so, so {{that as long as the}} pin is held down by slight {{pressure}} it cannot escape over the terminals, and the fastening is secure.|$|E

50|$|A {{variant of}} the game, named Brussels Sprouts after the vegetable, starts {{with a number of}} crosses, i.e. spots with four <b>free</b> <b>ends.</b> Each move {{involves}} joining two <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> with a curve, again not crossing any existing line, and then putting a short stroke across the line to create two new <b>free</b> <b>ends.</b> This game is finite, and the total number of moves (and thus the game's winner) is predetermined by the initial number of crosses: the players cannot affect the result by their play.|$|R

25|$|The <b>free</b> <b>end</b> {{of the dog}} (called the hammer) {{rests on}} the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is striken, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|E
25|$|Precession can be {{demonstrated}} by placing a spinning top with its axis horizontal and supported loosely (frictionless toward precession) at one end. Instead of falling, as might be expected, the top appears to defy gravity by remaining with its axis horizontal, when {{the other end of}} the axis is left unsupported and the <b>free</b> <b>end</b> of the axis slowly describes a circle in a horizontal plane, the resulting precession turning. This effect is explained by the above equations. The torque on the top is supplied by a couple of forces: gravity acting downward on the device's centre of mass, and an equal force acting upward to support one end of the device. The rotation resulting from this torque is not downward, as might be intuitively expected, causing the device to fall, but perpendicular to both the gravitational torque (horizontal and perpendicular to the axis of rotation) and the axis of rotation (horizontal and outwards from the point of support), i.e., about a vertical axis, causing the device to rotate slowly about the supporting point.|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} {{example of}} an entropic force is the elasticity of a freely-jointed polymer molecule. For an ideal chain, maximizing its entropy means reducing the distance between its two <b>free</b> <b>ends.</b> Consequently, a force that tends to collapse the chain is exerted by the ideal chain between its two <b>free</b> <b>ends.</b> This entropic force {{is proportional to the}} distance between the two ends. The entropic force by a freely-jointed chain has a clear mechanical origin, and can be computed using constrained Lagrangian dynamics.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} (1 /σ) {{expansion}} {{to calculate}} the thermodynamic properties of systems such as the Ising model or percolation whose diagrammatic expansion contains only diagrams with no <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> is reviewed. Here σ=z− 1, where z is the coordination number of the lattice. For more general problems we formulate a self-consistency condition for a site potential h, so that diagrams with <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> are eliminated. Construction of h gives the leading order in (1 /σ) solution and is exact for the Cayley tree. We obtain correction terms by using a bond renormalized interaction so that to order (1 /σ) 5 we need only consider two-site problems. Results are given for (1) Kc, the critical fugacity for animals, when either H, the fugacity for <b>free</b> <b>ends,</b> or Q, the density of <b>free</b> <b>ends,</b> is fixed, and (2) (t/Ec), where Ec is the mobility energy and t is {{the magnitude of the}} hopping matrix element whose sign is random. At d= 8 our results appear to be accurate to within about 0. 01 % for both animals and localization. We also obtain an expansion for Q(Kc) /(zKc) whose divergence near spatial dimensionality d= 4 supports the idea that the order-parameter exponent β for lattice animals passes through zero at d= 4...|$|R

2500|$|C'b is a {{modification}} factor {{used in the}} equation for nominal flexural strength when determining lateral-torsional buckling. [...] The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced. [...] The conservative value for C'b can be taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, {{but in some cases}} it may be excessively conservative. C'b is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the <b>free</b> <b>end</b> is unbraced, Cb is equal to 1. Tables of values of C'b for simply supported beams exist.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a column}} is loaded {{suddenly}} {{and then the}} load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a drop hammer. The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (<b>free)</b> <b>end</b> and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than {{the length of the}} rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically-loaded column.

50|$|Most {{bacterial}} chromosomes {{contain a}} circular DNA molecule - {{there are no}} <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> to the DNA. <b>Free</b> <b>ends</b> would otherwise create significant challenges to cells with respect to DNA replication and stability. Cells that do contain chromosomes with DNA ends, or telomeres (most eukaryotes), have acquired elaborate mechanisms to overcome these challenges. However, a circular chromosome can provide other challenges for cells. After replication, the two progeny circular chromosomes can sometimes remain interlinked or tangled, {{and they must be}} resolved so that each cell inherits one complete copy of the chromosome during cell division.|$|R

40|$|Concern for {{possible}} adverse effects of end restraint in triaxial compression testing is almost {{as old as the}} technique of conducting such tests. A finite element model is established to study the influence of end restraint effects on drained triaxial strength of soil in this paper. Results from simulations with <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> are compared with those from simulations with restraint ends. The comparison revealed that the obtained shear strengths from simulations with <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> and restraint ends are almost the same for non-dilative soil. With the increase in dilation angle, the relationship between the average deviatoric stress of all of the elements in the specimen and the vertical displacement did not show any change. However, the stress in the specimen with <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> was uniform while the stress in the specimen with fixed ends was not uniform. The investigation shows that the end restraints only influence the stress distribution in the specimen and do not influence the overall behaviour of it for drained triaxial tests...|$|R
2500|$|The {{tailhook}} is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its <b>free</b> <b>end</b> flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E
2500|$|Z'EV and Einstürzende Neubauten {{made several}} {{percussion}} instruments out of trash. No Wave artist Glenn Branca began building 3rd bridge zithers {{with an additional}} movable bridge positioned on the just intoned knotted positions of the harmonic series. Hans Reichel (Born 1949) is a German improvisational guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple fretboards and unique positioning of pickups {{as well as the}} same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional tuning and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His Daxophone consists of a single wooden blade fixed in a block containing a contact microphone. Normally, it is played by bowing the <b>free</b> <b>end,</b> {{but it can also be}} struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein.

2500|$|About {{three days}} after the egg is laid, the <b>free</b> <b>end</b> of the egg becomes glassy white. The grub chews its way out with its tiny dark-tipped mandibles. Eventually, the eggshell splits, {{revealing}} the glistening, white, footless grub. The grub, still attached to the host tarantula by its tail end, arches over and digs into the tarantula’s skin, creating a perforation aided by a dissolving fluid. Now that the grub is firmly attached by both its tail and head to the tarantula, it begins to suck the juices out of the tarantula’s body. As it feeds, the larva grows, rapidly engorging itself on the tarantula and darkening in color. As it grows, it molts several times, casting off its head capsule and body skin. After each molt, it resumes feeding, often through a new perforation. By the fourth instar, the tarantula’s abdomen has collapsed slightly. At the fifth and last instar, the larva has developed a pair of stout three-toothed mandibles in order to keep up with its feeding habits. The larva has become muscular and mobile by this stage. [...] It will cut a hole into the tarantula’s carapace and thrust its head and thorax inside the host spider, continuing to feed ravenously. As it feeds, it hollows out the tarantula, up to the bases of the spider’s hairy legs. [...] At the beginning of this invasive assault, the tarantula finally expires. This entire process from egg to fifth instar takes around 35 days total.|$|E
40|$|The tandemly {{repeated}} hexanucleotide C-C-C-C-A-A {{has previously}} been found near the termini of extrachromosomal gene coding for ribosomal RNA {{as well as in}} many other locations of the genome of Tetrahymena. Moreover, the organization of these clusters of repeats in the somatic macronucleus is different from that in the germinal micronucleus. In this study we used the exonuclease Bal 31 to show that the repeats are located near <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> of DNA in the macronucleus. When whole cell DNA or macronuclear DNA was digested with Bal 31 to remove approximately 600 base pairs from <b>free</b> <b>ends,</b> 80 % of the C 4 A 2 repeats were removed, as judged by hybridization. Because no particular cluster was resistant to exonuclease digestion, we believe that essentially all the C 4 A 2 repeats are located near <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> of DNA.

40|$|Abstract The Sax-Markov binary eurejoining/misrejoin-ing (SMBE) {{model is}} a {{stochastic}} representation of Sax’s breakage-and-reunion mechanism of misrejoining DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this model, to approxi-mate DSB misrejoining probabilities that decrease with increasing distance, the nucleus is treated {{as a collection of}} η isolated nuclear subvolumes called sites; DSB <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> within the same site interact with a probability that is independent of distance, and DSB <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> within dif-ferent sites never interact. In our previous work, SMBE steady-state solutions were used to estimate η from a combination of high-dose PFGE (pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis) data and moderate-dose chromosomal aberra-tion data. Here, analytic SMBE transient solutions (i. e., time courses of DSBs and misrejoinings) are derived and used to estimate η from various sets of misrejoining DSB kinetic data. The time courses are multiexponentials with rate constants κ, 6 κ, 15 κ, [...] . j(2 j– 1) κ corresponding to different nuclear site states and not different types of DSBs. For example, the κ component corresponds to nu-clear sites with two DSB <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> and thus only one pos-sible rejoining interaction, and the 6 κ component corre-sponds to sites with four DSB <b>free</b> <b>ends</b> and thus six (four choose two) potential rejoining interactions – four of these six potential interactions lead to a final state of two misrejoinings and the other two of six lead to a final state of correct repair (unrejoinable DSBs are not represented in the SMBE model). The SMBE time course solutions provide site number estimates that fall in the range of η≈ 10 – 100 for premature chromosome condensation (PCC) data and η≈ 1000 for PFGE data...|$|R
