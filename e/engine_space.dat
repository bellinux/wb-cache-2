5000|$|The first warship to {{use only}} fuel oil {{propulsion}} was the Royal Navy's torpedo boat destroyer , after experiments in 1904, although the obsolescence of coal as a fuel in British warships was delayed by its availability. Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the [...] of 1909.In spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the crew spaces, extending 1/4 to 1/3 the way along the hull. Aft of the crew spaces was as much <b>engine</b> <b>space</b> as the technology of the time would allow: several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, {{in front of the}} bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.|$|E
50|$|If {{equipped}} with internal combustion or turbine engines, engine rooms employ some means of providing air {{for the operation}} of the engines and associated ventilation. If individuals are normally present in these rooms, additional ventilation should be available to keep engine room temperatures to acceptable limits. If personnel are not normally in the <b>engine</b> <b>space,</b> as in many pleasure boats, the ventilation need only be sufficient to supply the engines with intake air. This would require an unrestricted hull opening of {{the same size as the}} intake area of the engine itself, assuming the hull opening is in the engine room itself. Commonly, screens are placed over such openings and if this is done, airflow is reduced by approximately 50%, so the opening area is increased appropriately. The requirement for general ventilation and the requirement for sufficient combustion air are quite different. A typical arrangement might be to make the opening large enough to provide intake air plus 1000 Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) for additional ventilation. Engines pull sufficient air into the engine room for their own operation. However, additional airflow for ventilation usually requires intake and exhaust blowers.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of 10-11 October, Tang sank the cargo ships Joshu Go and Ōita Maru. The {{submarine}} continued on patrol until 23 October, when she contacted a large convoy consisting of three tankers, a transport, a freighter, and numerous escorts. Commander O'Kane planned a night surface attack. Tang broke {{into the middle of}} the formation, firing torpedoes as she closed on the tankers (later identified as freighters). Two torpedoes struck under the stack and engine room of the nearest, a single burst into the stern of the middle one, and two exploded under the stack and <b>engine</b> <b>space</b> of the farthest. The first torpedoes began exploding before the last was fired, and all hit their targets, which were soon either burning or sinking. As the submarine prepared to fire at the tanker which was crossing her stern, she sighted the transport bearing down on her in an attempt to ram. Tang had no room to dive, so she crossed the transport's bow and with full left rudder saved her stern and got inside the transport's turning circle. The transport was forced to continue her swing to avoid the tanker, which had also been coming in to ram. The tanker struck the transport's starboard quarter shortly after the submarine fired four stern torpedoes along their double length at a range of 400 yd. The tanker sank bow first and the transport had a 30° up-angle. With escorts approaching on the port bow and beam and a destroyer closing on the port quarter, Tang rang up full speed and headed for open water. When the submarine was 6000 yd from the transport, another explosion was observed, and its bow disappeared.|$|E

40|$|A harsh {{environment}} {{can be defined}} {{by one or more}} of the following: High temperature, high shock, high radiation, erosive flow, and corrosive media. Among all the {{harsh environment}} applications, high temperature applications have drawn lots of attention due to the emerging activity in automotive, turbine <b>engine,</b> <b>space</b> exploration and deep-well drilling telemetry. Silicon carbide has become the candidate for these harsh environment applications because of its wide bandgap, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and high breakdown electric field strength. This dissertation details the two building blocks of high-temperature UV sensing chip, namely Ultraviolet sensor and transistors. High temperature performance of silicon carbide metal-semiconductor-metal UV sensor is characterized at high temperatures for the first time. The sensor exhibits high photo-to-dark current ratio and fast rise and fall time even at high temperatures. Complementary SiC junction field-effect transistors of different gate configurations are proposed, fabricated and characterized from room temperature to 600 °C for the first time. High intrinsic gains at high temperatures suggest that complementary junction field-effect transistors are suitable devices for high temperature operational amplifier...|$|E
40|$|Methane is a {{promising}} propellant for future liquid rocket engines. In the cooling channels of a regeneratively cooled engine, {{it would be}} close to the critical point. This results in drastic changes in the fluid properties, which makes cooling analysis a challenge. This thesis describes a two-pronged approach to tackle this problem. Simple and fast engineering tools allow for the development of insight in the design space using rapid iterations and parametric analyses. However, they are often rather inaccurate. In contrast, detailed multi-dimensional tools for numerical analysis are more accurate, but they require more computation time. Both approaches are developed for the analysis of regenerative cooling channels of oxygen/methane engines. Each approach uses complex but accurate models for the thermodynamic and transport properties of methane. OMECA (short for One-dimensional Methane Engine Cooling Analysis) is a one-dimensional tool that was developed in Python from scratch. This tool divides a nozzle into stations and analyses the one-dimensional thermal equilibrium at each station. It makes extensive use of semi-empirical equations to calculate the heat transfer at both the hot gas side and the coolant side. The tool is compared to a coupled multi-physics analysis tool, showing that the accuracy of the wall temperature is rather poor, with discrepancies of up to 150 ~K. Both at the hot gas and coolant side, large deviations are present. However, if the input heat flux is correct, OMECA predicts the coolant pressure drop and temperature rise with a 10 % accuracy. To obtain a higher accuracy at the coolant side, the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM is adapted for analysis of supercritical methane. Of particular note is the custom library that interpolates the fluid property tables at runtime. The selected solver is applicable to steady-state compressible flows. The software is then systematically validated using three validation cases. With experimental validation data obtained through cooperation with CIRA, an accuracy of 15 K for the wall temperature prediction is demonstrated. The pressure drop is predicted within 10 %. Traditionally, the launcher industry uses copper alloys as wall material in regeneratively cooled combustion chambers. They offer a high allowable temperature and high thermal conductivity, but are also heavy and expensive. Recently, several companies have demonstrated aluminium combustion chambers. Aluminium alloys have weight and cost advantages, but have lower allowable temperature and thermal conductivity. The developed tools for cooling analysis are therefore employed to compare aluminium and copper for a generic 10 ~kN combustion chamber. It is discovered that a thermal barrier coating must be employed to protect the hot gas side of an aluminium combustion chamber, otherwise regenerative cooling is not feasible. Even with such a coating, the pressure drop required to cool the coated aluminium chamber is three times higher than the pressure drop required for a copper chamber. A difference in pressure drop has effects on the vehicle level. A larger pressure drop in the cooling channel of a rocket engine necessitates a higher feed pressure. For a pressure fed engine, this means the tank must be stronger and heavier. It is found that even at modest fuel mass, the increase in tank mass is eight times as large as the decrease in engine mass offered by aluminium. This shows that using aluminium for the chamber wall is not advantageous with respect to copper for a pressure fed, regeneratively cooled, oxygen/methane rocket <b>engine.</b> <b>Space</b> Systems EngineeringSpace EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
