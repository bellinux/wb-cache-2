25|$|The {{management}} of HIV/AIDS normally includes {{the use of}} multiple antiretroviral drugs in an attempt to control HIV infection. There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle. The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>therapy</b> (HAART). HAART decreases the patient's total burden of HIV, maintains function of the immune system, and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death.|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} {{approach is}} to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals using <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>therapy</b> that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of nitazoxanide, paromomycin, and azithromycin together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that nitazoxanide be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is not {{necessary}} since the lesion is benign, however the person may have esthetic concerns about the appearance. The condition often resolves rapidly with high dose acyclovir or desiclovir but recurs once this therapy is stopped, or as the underlying immunocompromise worsens. Topical use of podophyllum resin or retinoids has also been reported to produce temporary remission. Antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine may be effective in producing a significant regression of OHL. Recurrence of the lesion may also signify that <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>therapy</b> (HAART) is becoming ineffective.|$|E

40|$|To-date, most socio-behavioural {{research}} about HIV-infected patients' adherence to <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>therapies</b> (HAART) {{has been based}} on cross-sectional studies. The French APROCO cohort gave us the opportunity to conjointly analyse the relationships between short-term adherence to HAART and HIV-infected patients' characteristics before initiation of treatment on the one hand, factors related to patients' subjective experience with HAART on the other hand. At the fourth-month follow-up visit (M 4) after first prescription of HAART (M 0), 26. 7 % of our sample of 445 patients self-reported non-adherence behaviour. Some patients' characteristics at M 0 (younger age, poor housing conditions, lack of social support, and problems of adherence with previous antiretroviral regimens) were related to non-adherence at M 4 in multivariate analysis. Non-adherence at M 4 was, however, also related to the evolutions that affected a number of factors between M 0 and M 4 : levels of depression, symptoms associated with treatment side effects, perception of individual state of health, beliefs towards effectiveness and toxicity of HAART, increases in alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as contacts with other physicians than hospital HAART prescribers. Our prospective study brings additional evidence that even short-term non-adherence cannot be reliably predicted on the sole basis of a few a priori patient characteristics that clinicians could easily identify before initiation of HAART. It suggests that a dynamic approach to adherence, continuously monitoring the impact of experience with HAART on patients' daily lives, is needed for improving management of HIV/AIDS care.

25|$|The {{morbidity}} and mortality caused by HCV has increased {{since the inception of}} <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>therapy</b> (HAART) because HIV patients are living longer from potent antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis of traditional opportunistic infections. The effect of HCV on the natural history of HIV remains inconclusive due to contradictory studies documenting no effect, while others show an increase to an AIDS defining illness or death. In the United States, approximately 150,000 to 300,000 people are co-infected with HIV and HCV. This represents 15% to 30% of all HIV infected patients and 5% to 10% of all HCV patients. Reduced HCV antibody production, drug interactions, other causes of liver disease, differing epidemiologic characteristics and natural history complicate the management of HCV/HIV patients. Until recently there was little data published regarding treating HIV–HCV co-infected patients; fortunately recent trials have been published about the safety and efficacy of current treatment options.|$|E
