5|$|In August 2007, {{the first}} price drop was {{announced}} for all Stock Keeping Units (SKU's) of the Xbox 360. The Core system's price was reduced in the United States by $20, the Premium by $50, and the Elite model by $30. Also, the <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> previously exclusive to the Elite system, {{was added to}} new models of the Premium and Arcade systems; the Core system was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.|$|E
25|$|Like the 2009 version, a Mini DisplayPort (which {{allows for}} a VGA connection, via a non-included cable) is included. A <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> which Apple {{describes}} as being HDMI 1.4 compliant, replaces the Mini-DVI port on the prior models {{as one of the}} main video connection methods. The <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> supports up to 1080p on HDMI connections and 8 channel 24-bit audio at 192kHz, Dolby Surround 5.1 and stereo output. With the included HDMI to DVI adapter, for those currently using a DVI interface, the <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> will work with resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 pixels, while the Mini DisplayPort can concurrently support a resolution up to 2560 × 1600 pixels.|$|E
5|$|Released in 2010, the Sony BRAVIA KDL22PX300 is a 22-inch 720p {{television}} which {{incorporates a}} PlayStation 2 console, along with 4 <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
25|$|On May 16, 2005 at E3, Sony unveils a PlayStation 3 {{prototype}} with 2 <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports,</b> 6 USB {{ports and}} 3 ethernet ports. This was never {{planned to be}} released.|$|R
2500|$|If a television's <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> {{support the}} Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature, {{pressing}} the cast button will also {{result in the}} video-capable Chromecast automatically turning on the TV and switching the television's active audio/video input using the CEC command [...] "One Touch Playback".|$|R
25|$|The XO 4 is {{a refresh}} of the XO 1 to 1.75 with a later ARM CPU and an {{optional}} touch screen. This model {{will not be}} available for consumer sales. There is a mini <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> to allow connecting to a display.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{prototype}} shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports; however, {{when the system}} was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> one Ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs. Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20GB model and a 60GB model, priced at US$499 (€499) and US$599 (€599), respectively. The 60GB model {{was to be the}} only configuration to feature an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver. Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11, 2006, for Japan and November 17, 2006, for North America and Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Chromebit is a dongle {{running on}} Google's Chrome OS {{operating}} system. When {{placed in the}} <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> of a television or a monitor, this device turns that display into a personal computer. Chromebit allows adding a keyboard or mouse over Bluetooth or via the USB port.|$|E

50|$|With {{an active}} adapter, MHL devices {{are able to}} connect to HDMI display devices {{that do not have}} MHL {{capability}} by actively converting the signal to HDMI. These adapters often feature an additional Micro-USB port on them to provide charging power to the mobile device because standard <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> do not supply sufficient current.|$|R
5|$|An <b>HDMI</b> out <b>port</b> {{was added}} to the Premium Xbox 360 in May 2007.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the similar}} small form factor, <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> remote control IR receiver, and media browser {{interface}}, some users see the Mac Mini as an Apple TV alternative. It has both iTunes for media rental, purchase, and management, and a native user interface with Front Row, {{based on the}} user interface of the original Apple TV. The Apple TV is limited to video in the MP4 format, whereas Mac Mini users employing the appropriate QuickTime codecs can watch other video formats like Divx, Xvid, and the Matroska (Mkv) container, or almost all other formats using an open source player such as VLC, without resorting to hacks. The current Intel models of Mac Mini can display video via the <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> at a maximum resolution of 1920x1200 and up to 2560x1600 via the Mini DisplayPort with a compatible monitor.|$|E
25|$|Chromecast {{devices are}} dongles that are powered by {{connecting}} the device's micro-USB port to an {{external power supply}} or a USB port. Video-capable Chromecasts plug into the <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> of a high-definition television or monitor, while the audio-only model outputs sound through its integrated 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket. By default, Chromecasts connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a wired connection.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 2006, Sony {{announced}} that PAL region PlayStation3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, {{because of a}} shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray drive. At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22, 2006, Sony {{announced that}} it would include an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> on the 20GB system, but a chrome trim, flash card readers, silver logo and Wi-Fi would not be included. Also, the launch price of the Japanese 20GB model was reduced by over 20%, and the 60GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan. During the event, Sony showed 27 playable PS3 games running on final hardware.|$|E
50|$|Released in 2010, the Sony BRAVIA KDL22PX300 is a 22 inch 720p {{television}} that incorporates a PlayStation 2 console and four <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports.</b> The 720p TV also includes BRAVIA Internet Video Access, allowing users access to streaming {{services such as}} YouTube and on-demand television, but only released in Europe. Although the maximum resolution is 720p/1366×768, 1080p input sources can be used and displayed.|$|R

50|$|A later {{development}} to the CrossFire infrastructure includes a dual GPUs with on-board PCI Express bridge that {{was released in}} early 2008, the Radeon HD 3870 X2 and later in Radeon HD 4870 X2 graphics cards, featuring only one CrossFire connector for dual card, four GPU scalability. When using two GPUs on board the same system, the <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> on the GPUs cannot both work at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Pre-2009 Mac Mini models had a video {{connector}} {{which was}} compatible with DVI, HDMI (video only), SVGA, S-Video and composite video {{with the appropriate}} adapter. Sound is provided by a combination jack that uses both mini-headphone (analog) and optical fiber cables (digital). Unlike the Apple TV, the Mac Mini is backward compatible with televisions that have only composite or S-Video inputs. As of the July 2011 revision of the Mac Mini, the computer sports an Intel HD3000 graphics processor with an optional Radeon graphics processing unit available and Thunderbolt which makes decoding high-resolution video much quicker and efficient. The addition of an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> simplifies connecting the Mini to high-definition televisions and home theater AV receivers.|$|E
25|$|A {{new model}} of the Mac Mini was {{introduced}} on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a unibody aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers. It got a much anticipated refresh after long two years in October 2014, bringing Haswell CPUs, better graphics, $100 lower price for the base model, while the metal body remained nearly the same. The only change was {{the removal of the}} two holes used to open the case, as the RAM is no longer upgradable because it's now soldered to the logic board; this idea is similar to the Retina MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mid 2014 21.5-inch iMac.|$|E
500|$|On June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} MacBook Pro, marketed as the [...] "MacBook Pro with Retina display" [...] to differentiate it from the predecessor model. The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4" [...] IPS 2880×1800-pixel Retina Display. Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the [...] "MagSafe 2". Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.|$|E
50|$|The A720 uses a quad-core Intel Core-i7 processor, 8 {{gigabytes}} of RAM, and a 1-terabyte hard drive. A DVD-drive comes {{standard and}} an upgrade to Blu-ray is an option. Ports include ethernet, two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 connections respectively, and <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> for both input and output. The A720's ability to accept HDMI input allows {{for using the}} screen with external devices. An internal TV-tuner is optional.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} the fully digital HDTV {{displays}} helped to complete the value {{and ease of use}} of a HTPC system. Digital projectors, plasma and LCD displays often came pre-configured to accept computer video outputs including VGA, DVI and Component Video. Furthermore, both the computers and the displays could include video scalers to better conform the image to the screen format and resolutions. Likewise, computers also included <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> that carry both audio and video signals to home video displays or AV Receivers.|$|R
5000|$|The rule's Demodulator Compliance Requirements {{insists that}} all HDTV demodulators must [...] "listen" [...] for the flag (or assume {{it to be}} present in all signals). Flagged content must be output only to [...] "protected outputs" [...] (such as DVI and <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports</b> with HDCP encryption), or in {{degraded}} form through analog outputs or digital outputs with visual resolution of 720x480 pixels (EDTV) or less. Flagged content may be recorded only by [...] "authorized" [...] methods, which may include tethering of recordings to a single device.|$|R
2500|$|Initially {{there were}} no digital video outputs such as DVI or HDMI on the Xbox 360; instead, HD-quality output could only be {{produced}} over [...] component video (used by both the 3 RCA component cable and the Japanese D-terminal cable) and later [...] VGA (via a software update). A <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> {{was introduced to the}} Xbox 360 by July 2007 with the introduction of the Elite model. All Xbox 360 SKUs currently manufactured feature an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port.</b> A wide array of SDTV and HDTV resolutions are supported by the console hardware; up to 1080p after the October 2006 software upgrade. While most games are rendered natively at 720p, the video from all games can be scaled by the hardware to whatever resolution the user has set in the console's settings; from 480i NTSC and 576i PAL all the way to 1080p HDTV.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, early {{concepts}} of the Raspberry Pi {{were based on the}} Atmel ATmega644 microcontroller. Its schematics and PCB layout are publicly available. Foundation trustee Eben Upton assembled a group of teachers, academics and computer enthusiasts to devise a computer to inspire children. The computer is inspired by Acorn's BBC Micro of 1981. The ModelA, ModelB and ModelB+ names are references to the original models of the British educational BBC Micro computer, developed by Acorn Computers. The first ARM prototype version of the computer was mounted in a package the same size as a USB memory stick. [...] It had a USB port on one end and an <b>HDMI</b> <b>port</b> on the other.|$|E
2500|$|The power {{connectors}} on {{the back}} of these systems incorporate a [...] "keying" [...] system that will prevent plugging a (newer) lower-rated power supply into an older system (which needs more power). The keying system does, however, allow older power supplies to be connected to newer systems, as this poses no problem. [...] The initial motherboard version was known as [...] "Xenon" [...] and used a 203watt power supply, and lacked a HDMI video port. The [...] "Zephyr" [...] revision was largely the same aside from the addition of the <b>HDMI</b> <b>port,</b> and an improved GPU heatsink. The [...] "Falcon" [...] incorporated a newer 65nm CPU, 80nm GPU and eDRAM, and it required less power so it came packaged with a 175watt power supply. [...] "Jasper" [...] (released late August or early September 2008) used both a 65nm CPU and GPU, as well as 16, 256 or 512MB of on-board flash memory. (This was to help run a then-recent Dashboard update. Without the addition of this internal memory, a hard disk drive or memory card is required.) The [...] "Jasper" [...] revision required even less power, and so the power supply was also reduced to 150 watts. Xbox 360 S introduced a new motherboard version called [...] "Trinity" [...] with a 45nm integrated CPU, GPU, and eDRAM (i.e. all in the same chip package). In 2011 a second model of the Xbox 360 S motherboard has been released known as [...] "Corona" [...] which integrates the HANA chip into the southbridge chip.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, some cameras {{also have}} 4K {{capability}} and 3D, even some cameras costing less than US$900. It needs {{at least a}} TV/monitor with <b>HDMI</b> 1.4a <b>port.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "Crossfire", the HP TouchSmart IQ770 {{featured}} a 19-inch touchscreen, an AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-52 processor, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600. It had {{a wide array of}} ports, including Ethernet, two FireWire, six USB 2.0 ports, one with HP printer power Y-cable connector, 5.1 + digital audio out, IR out, mini-VGA, FM coax, TV coax, ATSC, and two S-Video; however, the IQ770 did not have <b>HDMI</b> <b>ports.</b> PC World gave the machine a [...] "very good" [...] rating of 81/100, but noted that the use of mobile components slowed the computer ...|$|R
