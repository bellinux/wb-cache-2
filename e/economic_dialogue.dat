40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the U. S. -China Strategic and <b>Economic</b> <b>Dialogues</b> (S&ED) {{to uncover the}} organizational and rhetorical mechanisms by which U. S. and Chinese officials attempt to forge cooperative relations while managing issues of conflict. I argue for a communication centered approach for understanding geopolitical relations and the socialization process by which norms and values take root amongst U. S. and Chinese officials. To do so, I draw upon organizational institutionalism to uncover competing organizational logics guiding and constraining the S&ED through an organizational rhetorical lens while also providing a new theoretical conception of public diplomacy {{as a means to}} legitimize the S&ED as a mechanism for managing the complex bilateral relationship. Texts under analysis include the press releases, speeches, memos of understanding, and agreements published following each of the eight annual S&ED meetings from 2009 - 2016, totaling over 160 documents. Findings suggest that the S&ED defines both the dialogue mechanism and bilateral relationship as founded upon a central logic of ?positive, cooperative, and comprehensive? relations between the two countries. Resulting from this logic, both the economic and strategic tracks of the S&ED focus on producing ever increasing, tangible outcomes encompassing wider areas of cooperation each year. These outcomes occur most significantly within the economic track discussions as well cooperation on climate change and exchange programs. Not until the later years of the S&ED, with the incorporation of a ?new model of major country relations? are more security related issues addressed, with criticism of diverging view points on sensitive issues naturalized as expected given the S&ED?s value of dialogue and attention redirected from these issues to focus on the positive outcomes reached in other areas. Success of the S&ED relies upon self-reflexive praise by participants of the S&ED regarding its effectiveness in order to justify to domestic constituencies in both nations the continuance and support of the dialogue mechanism. This suggests that even after eight years of meeting, the dialogue mechanism is a fragile one, predicated on producing continuous success. Nonetheless, the breadth and number of agreements, exchanges, and growth of coordination between the bureaucracies of each country demonstrates that cooperation is possible...|$|R

40|$|PRELIMINARY DRAFT NOT FOR CITATION The {{financial}} crisis that hit Asia in 1997 / 98 triggered {{the introduction of}} reforms to restructure and improve national financial systems, together with a substantial progress in regional financial cooperation initiatives. By many standards, Asian financial markets are now more efficient than before and more integrated among themselves, although the degree of financial integration in Asia remains low compared {{to the degree of}} trade integration and to the degree of Asian financial integration {{with the rest of the}} world. A number of cooperation initiatives have flourished after the 1997 / 98 crisis and in some cases they may need streamlining. Nevertheless, Asia is facing a deficit of established institutions to promote regional cooperation and further market integration. The ongoing global economic crisis created by the financial turmoil that started with the collapse of the US subprime housing market, is a good case to test the preparedness of the region to provide a collective response to limit the negative impact of the crisis on Asian economies and ensure stability and continued economic prosperity. So far, however, no significant development is being observed, especially on the front of <b>economic</b> policy <b>dialogue</b> and coordination. The reason may lie in the late realization that Asia is not immune from the crisis and the scarcity of effectiv...|$|R

From national interest perspective, China hopes to see Korean unification that would be in favor of China, at least it will not bring negative influence. China also desires for a unified Korea that is neutral or friendly towards China, and for the withdrawal of the U. S. armed forces from the Korean peninsula. Otherwise, China wants {{to maintain the status quo}} and present situation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the forward looking {{framework}} of policy <b>dialogue</b> and <b>economic</b> suveillance in East Asia, based on analysis of the necessities, constraints and difficulties, together with criteria for effective surveillance. It proposes a roadmap for strengthening the mechanisms for surveillance in East Asia, {{with the emphasis on}} defining different phases, designing possible approaches and identifying the key elements for better surveillance in the region. The study suggests that there should be three phases for forming strong institutionalised regional surveillance. It also discusses possible moves in the second phase with focus on the importance of specifying surveillance coverage and improving statistical infrastructure. The paper points out that the success of establishing a firmly instituionalised surveillance mechanism in East Asia, to a large extent, relies on a common understanding among the countries in the region on the following issues : the necessity of a common monetary regime, the vital importance of statistical infrastructure and the essential elements of political consideration. <b>Economic</b> surveillance, policy <b>dialogue,</b> East Asia...|$|R

The Bank's comparative advantage lies in policy development. It uses three main strategies: policy dialogue, sector work, and policy-oriented research. Policy dialogue occurs with government officials and program managers, mainly through discussions, Bank-sponsored seminars, and project development. Population sector work, which analyzes the population sector in a particular country, provides a base for operational activities and for initiating policy dialogue with program managers. Population research {{in recent years has}} focused on alternative policy and program strategies. The Bank's work in policy development has contributed greatly to shifts in government population policy in many countries, and its operational strategies have helped shape population programs in others.
