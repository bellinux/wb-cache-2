40|$|Recent {{revisions}} to the AASHTO Construction Specifications permit the specification of ASTM A 1035 reinforcing steel. A 1035 reinforcing bars are low carbon, chromium steel bars characterized by a high tensile strength (100 or 120 ksi) and a stress-strain relationship having no yield plateau. Because of their high chromium content, A 1035 bars are reported to have superior corrosion resistance when compared to conventional reinforcing steel grades. For this reason, designers have specified A 1035 as a direct, one-to-one, replacement for conventional reinforcing steel {{as an alternative to}} stainless steel or epoxy-coated bars. The AASHTO LRFD Design Specifications, however, limit the yield strength of reinforcing steel to 75 ksi for most applications. Therefore, although A 1035 steel is being specified for its corrosion resistance, its higher yield strength cannot be utilized. The objective of this research is to evaluate existing AASHTO LRFD Design Specifications to determine their applicability when using high strength ASTM A 1035 reinforcing bars in reinforced concrete structures. The study encompasses material testing and characterization, detailed analytical studies, component tests, and full-scale member testing. The analytical and experimental research program investigates ultimate strength and service behavior and detailing of members designed with high-strength reinforcement. Specifically, the topics addressed are: a) experimental evaluation of <b>hooked</b> <b>bar</b> development length of high-strength reinforcement; b) experimental evaluation of the fatigue performance of members reinforced with high-strength reinforcement; and c) parametric evaluation of serviceability and crack opening in flexural members, comparing the results with available experimental results. The applicability of current Specification requirements for <b>hooked</b> <b>bar</b> development lengths was confirmed through a series of pull-out tests having development lengths that were shorter than those required by present Specifications equations. Tests resulted in bar rupture outside of the anchorage region with very little slip clearly indicating the efficacy of the <b>hooked</b> <b>bar</b> development requirements in Specifications. It is recommended that such anchorage regions be provided with cover and confining reinforcement ¨C based on current design requirements ¨C when high-strength bars are used. The presence of confining reinforcement effectively mitigates potential splitting failures and results in suitably conservative anchorage capacities. Two large-scale proof tests conducted as part of this study and a review of available published data demonstrate that presently accepted values for the fatigue or ¡®endurance¡¯ limit for reinforcing steel are applicable and likely conservative, when applied to higher strength bars. Additionally, it is shown that fatigue considerations will rarely affect the design of typical reinforced concrete members having fy ¡Ü 100 ksi. The extension of present AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications for <b>hooked</b> <b>bar</b> anchorage and fatigue to permit reinforcing bar yield strengths not exceeding 100 ksi was validated for concrete strengths up to 10 ksi. A fundamental issue in using A 1035 or any other high-strength reinforcing steel is that the stress at service load is expected to be greater than when conventional steel is used. Consequently, the service-load reinforcing strains are greater, affecting deflection and crack widths. Based on the results of available flexural test, deflections and crack widths at service load levels were evaluated. Both metrics of serviceability were found to be within presently accepted limits, and were predictable using current Specifications provisions. A limitation on service-level stresses of fs ¡Ü 60 ksi is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Headed {{reinforcement}} is {{a relatively}} new product and has not been used in many applications. Headed reinforcing bars have been extensively used in the construction of offshore oil platforms where <b>hooked</b> <b>bars</b> have traditionally been used to anchor longitudinal reinforcement or bars bent for ties and transverse reinforcement. Hooks and bent-bar ties create a large amount of congestion in the reinforcing cage which leads to difficulties during construction. Using headed reinforcement removes the tail extensions of hooks and allows fewer larger bars to be used, greatly reducing the congestion of the reinforcing cage. It has been found that the use of headed reinforcement can greatly decrease the time needed to erect the reinforcement resulting in large cost savings. Headed reinforcement has also been used in a few projects for strengthening and repairing footings of highway structures. A total 81 Pullout test were performed to the study of Bond behavior of Headed reinforcement bar in concrete with different Embedment length with various diameters of bars, various grade of concrete and various sizes of cubes. In this research project, it is proposed to execute experimental work by using headed reinforcement bars. The effect of different parameters like embedment length, head shapes and concrete grades, threaded headed reinforcement bars can be study. The results will be used to develop design recommendations for the application of headed reinforcement bars...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{assessment}} {{of an existing}} reinforced concrete building designed to pre- 1970 s codes during a major earthquake focuses on investigating the global post-elastic responses of the building. The global post-elastic response of a reinforced concrete building can be studied based on the local post-elastic behaviour of the individual structural components. In this study, simulated seismic loading tests were conducted on as-built reinforced concrete beam-column joint sub assemblages {{in order to obtain}} the information on the post-elastic behaviour of as-built reinforced concrete components. Simulated seismic loading tests included two as-built full-scale interior beam-column joint units, four as-built full-scale exterior beam - column joint units and one retrofitted as-built exterior beam-column joint unit. The as-built test units contained the plain round longitudinal reinforcement and had the reinforcing details typical of an existing reinforced concrete structure constructed in the late 1950 s in New Zealand. The two as-built interior beam-column joint units, Unit 1 and Unit 2, were identical. Unit 1 was tested with zero column axial load and Unit 2 was tested with a compressive column axial load of 0. 12 Agfc'. According to the current codes, the two as-built interior beam-column joint units would develop premature shear failure in the joints, beams and columns. Both units when tested showed that, unlike the conclusion reached by the theoretical assessment using the current code method, the premature shear failure was precluded in the joint and members of the test units. For both units, the post-elastic behaviour of the reinforced concrete components was limited to the fixed-ends at the beam-column interfaces of the members, and it was {{in the form of a}} major flexural crack at the beam-column interfaces. Due to the plain round longitudinal reinforcement used, severe bond slip along the plain round longitudinal reinforcement occurred within and adjacent to the joint, resulting in significantly degrading flexural behaviour at the beam column interfaces of the members. For both units tested, the available structural stiffness and strength were low, especially the stiffness, and the degradation of the stiffness and strength was significant. Column bar buckling was also apparent, especially when the compressive axial load was present in the column. The four as-built exterior beam-column joint units, Units EJ 1 to EJ 4, were identical except for the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hook</b> details in the exterior columns. Identical units EJ 1 and EJ 3 had the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent away from the joint cores. Identical units EJ 2 and EJ 4 had the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent away from the joint cores. Units EJ 1 and EJ 2 were tested with zero column axial load but Units EJ 3 and EJ 4 were tested with a compressive column axial load of about O. 25 Agfc' present. The retrofitted unit was the original as-built unit EJ 1 with the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent away from the joint core, and the retrofit was achieved by wrapping the column areas immediately above and below the joint core using fibre-glass after tested to test an alternative force path across the joint core. According to the current code method, the premature shear failure would occur in the joint of Unit EJ 1 and in the beams of all the four as-built exterior beam-column joint units. Examination of the member force transfer across the joint showed that effective column transverse confinement within the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hook</b> range was critical in restraining the opening of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> and actuating the force transfer across the joint core, and an alternative force path across the joint core, in the case of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent away from the joint core in the exterior columns, could be actuated if sufficient column confinement above and below the joint core was available. The as-built units when tested with zero axial column load demonstrated very poor force strength and stiffness behaviour. The final failures were dominated by the concrete tension cracking along the outer layer of column main bars adjacent to the joint core, which was initiated by the interaction between the opening of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> and the column bar buckling, irrespective of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hook</b> details. The configuration of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent into the joint core was found to result in better seismic performance compared to that with the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks</b> bent away from the joint core in the case of zero axial column load and small amount of column transverse reinforcement provided. The as-built units when tested with constant compressive axial column load of about 0. 25 Agfc’; present demonstrated that the presence of compressive axial column load totally prevented the concrete tension cracking along the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hooks,</b> and the post-elastic behaviour of the test units was limited to the fixed-ends of the beams, in the form of a big beam fixed-end rotation. Generally, the compressive column axial load greatly improved the overall stiffness and force strength of the units. In this case the effects of different beam <b>bar</b> <b>hook</b> details on the seismic performance of the as-built exterior beam-column joint units became very insignificant. The test on the retrofitted as-built unit showed that fibre-glass jacketing in the column areas adjacent to the joint core restrained the opening of the beam <b>bar</b> <b>hook</b> and actuated the postulated alternative the force transfer path across the joint when the axial column load was low, leading to much improved stiffness and force strength performance. Overall, for the as-built reinforced concrete members reinforced by plain round longitudinal reinforcement, the post-elastic seismic behaviour was governed by the degrading flexural behaviour at the member fixed-end at the beam-column interfaces, in the form of big fixed-end rotations. A rotational ductility factor at the fixed-end, rather than a curvature ductility factor associated with a plastic hinge length, became a more useful index to the member post-elastic flexural deformation. Member flexural strength and stiffness were lower than the theoretical estimations, and they were significantly influenced by the force transfer mechanism across the joint core. Typically, the compressive column axial load at the same joint resulted in much improved flexural behaviour at the beam fixed-end. Based on the test evidence, a method was tentatively proposed for allowing for the beneficial effect on the member flexural behaviour at the fixed-end of the compressive axial load on the transverse members at the same joint. After obtaining the information on the post-elastic behaviour of as-built structural components, non-linear static and dynamic analyses were conducted for the subject building represented by the as-built test units. The non-linear static analysis showed that the earthquake-resisting capacity of similar structures do not satisfy the current design code requirements, a failure mechanism was very unlikely to form and the local member deformation capacity limited the structural performance during a major earthquake. No structural ductility can be relied on and the structural assessment has to be based on elastic response. Allowance for the masonry infills meant that the structural earthquake-resistant capacity was more inadequate. In this case, a soft storey failure mechanism could form, no ductility can be relied on. The non-linear dynamic analysis conducted for the subject building showed that similar existing reinforced concrete structures would survive during an earthquake with similar characteristics and magnitudes to the 1940 El Centro NS record...|$|R
