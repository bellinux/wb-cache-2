40|$|Repair {{performance}} in hierarchical data centers is often bottlenecked by cross-rack network transfer. Recent theoretical {{results show that}} the cross-rack repair traffic can be minimized through repair layering, whose idea is to partition a repair operation into inner-rack and cross-rack layers.

In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a practical repair layering framework called <b>DoubleR.</b> We design two families of practical double regenerating codes (DRC), which not only minimize the cross-rack repair traffic, but also have several practical properties that improve state-of-the-art regenerating codes. We implement and deploy <b>DoubleR</b> atop Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and show that <b>DoubleR</b> maintains the theoretical guarantees of DRC and improves the repair performance of regenerating codes in both node recovery and degraded read operations.

Eccentricity is considered because of the influence of the air gap variance on the electromagnetic field distribution.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{extensive}} {{network of}} transverse and longitudinal filamentous bridges was revealed when small myofibril bundles, prepared from Triton-EGTA-treated rabbit skeletal muscles, were extracted with KI {{to remove the}} majority of thin and thick filaments. Transmission and scanning electron microscopic studies of these salt-resistant cytoskeletal residues indicated: (a) small bundles of short transverse filaments connect adjacent myofibrils by forming Z to Z and M to M bridges; (b) parallel, continuous longitudinal filaments connect the peripheries of successive Z-disks and ensheath the sarcomere. These transverse and longitudinal filaments have the characteristic morphology of intermediate filaments; (c) two rings of tightly interwoven and tangled filaments, connected laterally by short filaments, encircle each Z disk. This <b>doublering</b> also encircles a weblike meshwork which penetrates the sarcomeric space. From the peripheries of these rings, transverse and longitudinal intermediate filaments emerge; and (d) a massive amount of, material translocated and accumulated near Z disks during KI extraction.

40|$|An {{increased}} global {{food demand}} requires {{an increase in}} agricultural land use, which in turn affects the hydrologic cycle. A central process {{in this regard is}} infiltration of rainfall through the land surface. While there are standard values available for different soil types, land cover also has a documented influence on infiltration rates. This makes infiltration highly variable acrosss patiotemporal scales and as such, difficult to measure in field, thus selection of an appropriate measurement technique is important to consider. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a method for robust infiltration measurements and compare rates from various crops (rice andmaize) and soils (sand and clay) {{to see if there is}} consistency between physical controls on infiltration and farming practices. The study area is located near the town of Ifakara in south-central Tanzania. Data were gathered during eight weeks (October- November) using variousring infiltrometer set-ups. The results from 12 comparative infiltration measurements indicated that a smaller ring implies less measurement precision. Precision was improved by using a <b>doublering</b> setup and/or a larger single ring. Infiltration measurements from the nine agricultural fields corresponded well to estimations from the Horton infiltration equation (correlation coefficient > 0. 98). The results from all 36 measurements indicated a statistically significant difference between crop types as well as between soil types. The significance was, however, higher for soils compared to crops. Part of the inconsistency of infiltration rates could be explained by the cultural factor where traditions are important for crop choice and farming. Further, the measured infiltration confirmed the large spatial variations of infiltration rates both within and across fields, with implications for large scale agricultural development...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that the measurements of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) are infl uenced by both the radial size and depth of a double-ring infi ltrometer. Few studies are available, however, on how the depth to which an infi ltrometer is driven affects Ks measurement. In this study, six inner ring depths (di = 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, and 60 cm), six outer ring depths (do = 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, and 60 cm), and their combinations were designed. Thus 24 sets of driven depths of infi ltrometer were involved. For each infi ltrometer set, 31 stochastic fields of Ks were randomly generated in the simulation domain by adopting six correlation lengths (L = 0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 cm) and six standard deviations (SD = 0, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0). Therefore, a total of 7224 simulations were conducted to investigate the driven-depth effect of the double-ring infi ltrometer on the measurements of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the wetted zone (Kw). Results demonstrated that the inner ring depth plays a more important role than the outer ring depth in Kw measurements by <b>doublering</b> infi ltrometer, and increasing the inner ring depth could obtain a better approximation of accurate Kw measurements. Meanwhile, the outer ring added to a single-ring infi ltrometer was necessary in guaranteeing vertical water flow in the inner ring and improving measurement accuracy. Considering that the disturbance of soil caused by ring installation will increase with increasing ring depth, the ring depth of 5 to 15 cm that has been adopted in most ring-infi ltrometer-related field experiments is acceptable and recommended for K w measurements.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical study of Bose-Einstein condensates in a <b>doublering</b> trap. In particular, we determine {{the ground states}} of the condensate in the double-ring trap that arise from the interplay of quantum tunnelling and the trap’s rotation. The trap geometry is a concentric ring system, where the inner ring is of smaller radius than the outer ring and both lie in the same two-dimensional plane. Due to the difference in radii between {{the inner and outer}} rings, the angular momentum that minimises the kinetic energy of a condensate when confined in the individual rings is different at most frequencies. This preference is in direct competition with the tunnel coupling of the rings which favours the same angular momentum states being occupied in both rings. Our calculations show that at low tunnel coupling ground state solutions exist where the expectation value of angular momentum per atom in each ring differs by approximately an integer multiple. The energy of these solutions is minimised by maintaining a uniform phase difference around most of the ring, and introducing a Josephson vortex between the inner and outer rings. A Josephson vortex is identified by a 2 p step in the relative phase between the two rings, and accounts for one quantum of circulation. We discuss similarities and differences between Josephson vortices in cold-atom systems and in superconducting Josephson junctions. Josephson vortices are actuated by a sudden change in the trapping potential. After this change Josephson vortices rotate around the double-ring system at a different frequency to the rotation of the double-ring potential. Numerical studies of the dependence of the velocity on the ground state tunnel coupling and interaction strength are presented. An analytical theory of the Josephson vortex dynamics is also presented which is consistent with our numerical results...|$|R
