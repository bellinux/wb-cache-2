40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring biases the plunger rod against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> return <b>spring</b> engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly.</b> Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> to lock the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently {{the use of}} <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> in {{the combat}} and {{commercial}} vehicle's suspension is increasing. Because of its nonlinear characteristics, the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> can support wide range of dynamic loads and gives good ride quality. In design of <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> isothermal and adiabatic processes are applied generally, but those processes could not produce heat transfer effect in the simulation. So in this study, heat transfer differential equation and BWR/Ideal state equation are {{used to calculate the}} pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> which is changing with time. The numerical analysis showed that the pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> forms a hysteresis loop in the both of the state equations. But the peak pressure value of BWR equation over 0. 1 Hz frequency are higher than that of adiabatic process. And the test results showed that the differences between test results and ideal gas equation are smaller than those of BWR equation, so the ideal equation is more accurate than BWR equation in this case...|$|R

The free piston linear machine is designed to create heavy vibrations, which are used to break the rock. A successful product relies {{on the ability to}} deliver a sufficient hammering energy per blow to break the rock, at a high frequency, yielding a high rate of penetration (ROP). To reach the goal of making a faster drilling machine, Resonator has targeted electrical power density and stiff springs in the free piston linear machine, as critical factors. They have found mechanical springs inadequate for their application and are therefore researching the use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in a free piston linear machine. This thesis is focusing on the use of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> in a free piston linear machine.

40|$|Abstract. The vehicle {{suspension}} system is directly influenced to ride and handling. Therefore, the major {{components of the}} {{vehicle suspension}} system should have enough fatigue strength during its lifetime to protect passenger from the traffic accident. Spring {{is one of the}} major suspension part of vehicle. Thus, in this paper, a fatigue design method for leaf spring was proposed. At first, numerical stress analysis for leaf <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> was performed. On the base of the analysis results, fatigue strength of leaf spring was assessed. And next, after studying numerically on geometrical parameters of leaf <b>spring</b> <b>assembly,</b> an economical prediction method of fatigue design criterion for leaf <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> using the theory of artificial neural network was developed and certified its usefulness. Without performing a lot of additional fatigue test for a long time, fatigue design criterion for a new leaf <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> having different geometry can be predicted on the base of the already obtained fatigue data. 1...|$|R

50|$|Some {{pneumatic}} recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> When compressed, {{they present}} initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken {{and then they}} move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine tuning of the spring power is also possible by altering the internal gas volume. This design for firearms was invented and patented by Collins and Shipman of Bedford, UK and Bergstrom in the U.S. in 2001.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the exergy losses {{stemming}} from heat transfer in compressors and expanders {{is important for}} many energy storage applications such as compressed air and pumped thermal storage. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} these losses, CFD simulations were performed for simple <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> for a <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> with an internal grid to mimic valve flow, and for a reciprocating compressor with functioning inlet and outlet valves. The wall heat exchanges for these three cases were examined and compared. The model adopted has previously been validated for a simple <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> using experimental data from literature. For the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> with an internal grid it was found that increased mixing leads to higher heat-transfer-induced hysteresis losses and (at high piston speeds) to a significant pressure loss. These two types of loss can be distinguished by undertaking adiabatic-wall calculations. For a compressor (i. e., with valve flows) heat transfer over the cycle depends very much on valve timing. For example, at 1500 rpm, when the delivery valve is opened at 7 bar the heat transfer coefficient for the initial stages of compression is similar to that for a simple <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> whereas for the same speed at 6 bar it is more than doubled.

40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable through bores on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device.

50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised {{slightly}} it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> that released <b>spring</b> pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|R
