5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message {{has the same}} quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} one bit of information per bit of message, but that any value less than one bit of information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E
500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the second}} season was announced, Fazekas said that [...] "We've {{certainly}} been talking about what a second season would look like...what's great about the structure of this show <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell so many different stories and go so many different directions." [...] Thus, Butters said of the first season storyline featuring Leviathan, [...] "we wrapped up that story" [...] already, with Toby Jones' cameo as Arnim Zola in the first season finale just [...] "a fun tie-in" [...] rather than {{something that would be}} followed up on in {{the second season}}. Series creators Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely revealed they [...] "had a really nice story about who Peggy is and where she came from" [...] that did not make it into the first season, but they hoped could be explored in a second, while Fazekas and Butters also revealed {{that there had been a}} story about Carter having [...] "a night out with the girls" [...] to explore her personal life, as well as more material for the character Angie, that they felt would both be easier to tell in a second season.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Billboard {{magazine}} {{review of}} the album, contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake [...] "claims to be bringing 'sexy' back to pop music, and indeed he <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> almost feel beads of sweat rolling off the title track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers [...] "tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility" [...] to [...] "SexyBack". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back. PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was the [...] "fraternal twin" [...] to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song [...] "Promiscuous". Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a [...] "raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses" [...] Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, [...] "it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was [...] "Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming {{a combination of the}} wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most.

In addition, {{she noted that}} the music is [...] "full of passion and fun, making them such an easily liked band". Melodic {{reviewer}} Tom Spinelli compared the album to the Put Up or Shut Up EP, calling it [...] "full of energy and life".

In a negative review for Punknews.org, mikexdude said the group created an [...] "uninspired disc devoid of any authenticity with So Wrong, It's Right". Around halfway into the album, he said the band [...] "successfully removed all the remaining endearing qualities of the genre. Is this really what pop-punk is like now?

2500|$|D'Arcy {{asked him}} to explain {{the format of the}} show, saying: [...] "The key to a good format <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> explain it in one or two sentences.

You choose 10 colours and they have different amounts in them. If all 10 add up to the total of money you want, then you win. If the money is not enough, then you lose out and there's no in between. It's either £80,000 or £90,000 or whatever, or you go home with el zippo."

[...] When asked about his ex-wife, Angie, he says [...] " [...] have really become close again, which we really haven't been in years.
