40|$|Background: Asthma is fast {{spreading}} disease {{among the}} people in Pakistan. Basic aim of study was to observe current prevalence and prescribing pattern of anti-asthmatic <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> Tertiary Care hospitals of Lahore. Methodology: A questionnaire based study was conducted from July to August 2017 in different Tertiary Care hospitals. 250 patients of asthma were selected by convenient random sampling. A questionnaire was designed and data collected was analyzed and results were represented {{in the form of}} graphs and tables. Results: Results showed that mostly prescribed medicines are 24 % xanthine derivatives, 23 % leukotriene modifiers, 23 % corticosteriods used as combined inhalers with long acting β 2 -agonist, 15 % bronchodilators, 9 % anti-cholinergics and 6 % corticosteroids. Prescriptions were prescribed by brand names. 7 % Therapeutic duplication and 75 % Polypharmacy was evaluated. Drugs prescribed per prescription were 2 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 4 %, 3 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 20 %, 4 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 41 %, 5 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 19 %, 6 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 11 %, 7 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 2 % and 8 <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 3 % of prescriptions. 18. 4 % were children and the ratio of females 76. 8 % was greater that of males 23. 2 %. 75 % patient compliance was observed. Conclusion: Preventive therapies used for asthma treatment were satisfactory but the pharmacist role was negligible. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Drug</b> <b>in</b> Me Is You was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The <b>Drug</b> <b>in</b> Me Is You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The <b>Drug</b> <b>in</b> Me is You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E

Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The <b>Drug</b> <b>in</b> Me Is You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E
