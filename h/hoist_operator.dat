50|$|A hoist {{controller}} is {{the controller}} for a hoist. The term is used {{primarily in the}} context of electrically operated hoists, but it is apparent that the control systems of many 20th century steam hoists also incorporated controllers of significant complexity. Consider the control system of the Quincy Mine No. 2 Hoist. This control system included interlocks to close the throttle valve at the end of trip and to prevent opening the throttle again until the winding engine was reversed. The control system also incorporated a governor to control the speed of the hoist and indicator wheels to show the <b>hoist</b> <b>operator</b> the positions of the skips in the mine shaft.|$|E
50|$|With only 30 {{cents in}} his pocket, Schieffelin {{set out to}} find his brother Al, whom he had not seen in four years. He {{believed}} Al was working the Silver King mine, about 180 mi to the north in central Arizona Territory near present-day Globe. But Schieffelin learned that Al had moved on to the McCracken Mine in Signal City, Arizona, another 300 mi north. Schieffelin spent his 30 cents on tobacco and had to pause in his search for his brother to earn enough money to go on. He found a job as a <b>hoist</b> <b>operator</b> at the Champion silver mine, and for fourteen days hauled up a dozen tons of ore every night by cranking a hand windlass.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} to enhance safety and control features for mine shaft hoists {{is being investigated}} {{by researchers at the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The objective of the research is to prevent injuries and fatalities related to hoist and elevator operations. Monitoring and controlling mine hoisting operations will allow <b>hoist</b> <b>operators,</b> inspectors, and maintenance personnel to increase their awareness of potentially dangerous situations and provide controls for safer operations. Process simulation and visualization software, real-time data sensing, and advanced programming techniques are being applied to this problem. Development of reliable and cost-effective sensors and data acquisition interfaces to monitor hoist loads and detect slack rope conditions is underway. Three-dimensional design software was used to visualize mine hoisting to enhance understanding of hoist operations. Quick Basic and Visual Basic (an object-oriented Windows interface) are being used for acquiring and processing hoisting data. Testing and evaluation of components are underway at USBM testing facilities. The resulting system will allow hoist personnel to assess critical operating parameters, such as hoist position, speed, acceleration, conveyance load, and rope tension...|$|R

5000|$|George D. [...] "Pete" [...] Morrison (August 8, 1890 - February 5, 1973) was an American silent western film actor born in Westminster, Colorado. During his {{childhood}} {{he lived in}} Morrison, Colorado (named for his grandfather George Morrison) and Idaho Springs, and got his early tastes of horsemanship riding with his father Thomas during the summer. They drove cattle and sheep from the summer ranges in Middle Park and Fall River in Colorado to supply beef and mutton to the mining camps of Georgetown, Idaho Springs, Nevadaville, Black Hawk and Central City. During his mid-teens Pete worked in the mining industry, with his older brothers driving in sections of the Argo Tunnel where Pete was a motorman, <b>hoist</b> <b>operator,</b> topside helper, teamster hauler, assisting several of the larger miners in the Idaho Springs area. In the summer of 1910 Pete Morrison was an engine fireman for the Colorado and Southern Railway when he was lured away by the early western movies. Pete began working as a stunt man for the Essanay Studios of Broncho Billy films, soon discovering he could make more money working in movies in 2 weeks than he could make working for a month on the railroad. Pete followed his older brother Chick Morrison to California, where he also became a star in early western pictures. Through his career, Morrison transcended from very early film in 1909 to sound in 1935 starring in some 132 pictures.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a helicopter with an externally slung load is highly demanding for the flight crew. Without having a direct view on the load, the pilot needs assistance by a crew member for load handling, e. g. load positioning. During Helicopter Hoist Operations (HHO), the <b>hoist</b> <b>operator</b> gives instructions to the pilot and stabilizes the load motion. An automatic load positioning system for HHO is designed with the aim to reduce the workload of the flight crew and to improve the load handling performance. The control system consists of a multi-loop architecture that is designed using multi-objective optimization. The system was designed to achieve best performance in load positioning for the entire cable length range of the rescue hoist. Load positioning performance {{is a function of}} the cable length; faster automatic load positioning can be achieved with shorter cable lengths. This paper describes the overall design process covering the tools, control law architecture, optimization, and the validation using DLR’s simulator...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A mine shaft is the {{lifeline}} to underground mines. Mine operators {{depend on}} safe, uninterrupted, and efficient {{movement of workers}} and materials. The shaft and hoisting system provides access to the network of openings used to recover the underground resource, provides vertical transport of miners and materials, and serves as an escapeway {{in case of an}} emergency. Accidents involving hoisting can be catastrophic. Such was the case in 1973 at the Markham Colliery in Derbyshire, UK when the conveyance overwound and fell to the shaft bottom, resulting in 17 deaths. Hoist and elevator machinery must meet the requirements specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 57 and 75. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data, many shaft-related accidents in the United States are associated with the hoisting cycle. MSHA statistics show that there were about 1500 shaft- related accidents in the 5 -year period between 1992 - 1996. Most of these accidents resulted from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism and involved movement of the conveyance which includes cages, skips, ore buckets, and elevators. A hoisting hazard may be characterized as an "unsafe hoist operating condition caused by insufficient or inaccurate information available to the hoist operator" (authors' quote). Earlier investigators have defined safety features and operating and maintenance standards for hoists, and reported on monitoring and control systems and sensors for hoists and conveyances [Farley, 1983; Ward, 19931. However, despite the considerable technological progress and hoisting control improvements in recent years, safety- related issues that require further investigation still remain. The <b>hoist</b> <b>operator</b> must constantly be aware of two important hoist-operating conditions: the position of the conveyance and the tension in the hoist rope. If this information is not available or is inaccurate, the hoist becomes unsafe. Current technology provides this information indirectly from sensors and indicators in the hoist room. However, unlike a building elevator hoistway, mine shaft hoistway problems often include: 1. poor ground conditions and excessive shaft wall and guide displacement; 2. rock bursts in deep mines (resulting in large rock movements and fragments blocking the hoist way); 3. water, ice, and salt buildup (impeding the smooth flow of the conveyance); 4. severe vibration from hoisting (resulting in loose guide support brackets, broken welds, or other alignment and conveyance mechanism malfunctions). The second issue relates to dynamic rope loads applied during normal winding, particularly during loading, acceleration, and stopping. Safety factors on wire rope are based on static load. They are artificially high to account for all cases of dynamic loads, even though the total load history on the rope (static and dynamic) during service is unknown. Therefore the tension, and thus the compliance with wire rope load safety factors, is unknown to the hoistman...|$|E
30|$|In an experiment, {{operators}} controlled {{a mobile}} robot by steering to trace reference lines. However, in our construction machine, operators {{control on the}} basis of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a <b>hoist</b> arm. <b>Operators</b> change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for operators to control the tip of a construction machine in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R

Thanks to the cooperation the success was confirmed in May 2016 with the withdrawal of the regulation on single PCDS.|$|R
40|$|Memory {{intensive}} applications require considerable arithmetic for the computation {{and selection}} of the different memory access pointers. These memory address calculations often involve complex (non) linear arithmetic expressions which have to be calculated during program execution under tight timing constraints, thus becoming a crucial bottleneck in the overall system performance. This paper explores applicability and effectiveness of sourcelevel optimisations (as opposed to instruction-level) for address computations {{in the context of}} multimedia. We propose and evaluate two processor-target independent source-level optimisation techniques, namely, global scope operation cost minimisation complemented with loop-invariant code <b>hoisting,</b> and non-linear <b>operator</b> strength reduction. The transformations attempt to achieve minimal code execution within loops and reduced operator strengths. The effectiveness of the transformations is demonstrated with two real-life multimedia applica [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association of neurodegenerative diseases and electric occupations and evaluates electric shocks and magnetic fields exposures. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of occupational electromagnetic fields (MF) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) to systematically explore methodological differences between studies. Second, we developed an electric shocks job exposure matrix (JEM) to characterize occupations exposed to electric shocks. Finally, we examined the association between occupational electric shocks, MF and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies on occupational MF exposure and NDD. We found weak associations of occupational MF exposures with both AD and MND, but not with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis. Risk of developing MND was associated with electric occupations, while AD risk was associated with estimated MF levels. Nonetheless, there is extensive result variation related to aspects of study design, with dissimilarity in this variation across diseases. Our results do not support MF as the explanation for the observed electric occupation and MND association. Misclassification of disease, particularly for AD, and imprecise exposure assessment affected most studies. To evaluate a consistent association between jobs in "electric" occupations and ALS, we developed a comprehensive JEM that includes electric shocks and MF. Electric shocks were based on two data sources along with expert judgment. Main occupational groups experiencing the electric shocks were precision production, craft and repair occupations. Specific jobs with high electric shock exposure were electrical apprentices, mechanic and repairer helpers, <b>hoist</b> and winch <b>operators</b> and electrical power installers. Examples of job titles with low electric-shock exposures were administrative support occupations, data-key entry operators, and waiters and waitresses. The relationship between occupational electric shocks, MF and ALS was investigated using cases identified in 1991 - 1999 U. S. mortality data. For each ALS death, 10 sex-, age-, year- and region-matched controls were selected. We linked the usual occupation reported on the death certificate to a JEM with electric shocks and MF. Increased odds ratios were observed for ALS among those in electric occupations (OR= 1. 23, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 1. 47). For electric shocks, ALS mortality odds ratios were 0. 73 (95 % CI: 0. 67, 0. 79) for high exposure and 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 84, 0. 97) for medium exposure compared to low exposure. For MF, ALS mortality odds ratios were 1. 09 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 19) for high exposure and 1. 09 (95 % CI: 0. 96, 1. 23) for medium exposure as compared to low. However, ALS mortality increased only in electric occupations with medium and low electric shocks exposures. Current results support an association between electric occupations and ALS, but provide no evidence that this association is explained by occupational exposure to electric shocks or MF...|$|R
