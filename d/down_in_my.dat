500|$|The Wonderwall {{score was}} Harrison's first {{opportunity}} to compose extensively for a single project. He later described how he went about preparing the music: [...] "I had a regular wind-up stopwatch and I watched the film to 'spot-in' the music with the watch. I wrote the timings <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book, then I'd go to , make up a piece, record it." [...] As with his songs for the Beatles over this period, including [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "Blue Jay Way", he composed mainly on keyboard instruments such as piano or organ, rather than guitar. In addition to the Indian pieces, Harrison wrote and arranged selections in Western musical styles. In some cases, these pieces were outlined to the musicians at the recording session by Harrison, on guitar, and they then improvised on his ideas. With other selections, he first made a demo, which the musicians followed.|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if you feel that I have fallen <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E

[...] He praised the [...] "breath-taking {{combination}} of killer artwork and creative level design," [...] and argued the game improved {{on the original}} in every way. He was especially impressed with the boss fights, the controls and the level design. He concluded [...] "MDK2 is this generation's best example of a pure action shooter, and goes <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book {{as one of the}} genre's most complete titles to date. Awesome visuals, creative design, killer boss encounters, excellent control, tons of variety, and even a dash of challenge thrown in for good measure. Nearly every aspect of BioWare's sensational sequel shines in a way that sheds a painfully revealing light on their competitors' glaring inadequacies." ...|$|E

Musician said about the album: [...] "Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often {{within the framework of}} a single song... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years.

2500|$|As {{an unknown}} {{stand-up}} comedian out of college, she struggled {{for many years}} before finding her comic style. She did stints in the Catskills and found that she disliked the older style of comedy at the time, such as Phyllis Diller's, who she felt was a pioneer female comedian. Her breakthrough came at The Second City in Chicago in 1961, where she was dubbed [...] "the best girl since Elaine May," [...] who also got her start there. But May became her and fellow comedian Treva Silverman's role model, as Rivers saw her as [...] "an assertive woman with a marvelous, fast mind and, at the same time, pretty and feminine." [...] It was also there that she learned [...] "self reliance," [...] she said, [...] "that I didn't have to talk <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humor" [...] and could still earn an income by making intelligent people laugh.

[...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand.

2500|$|Game 6 is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The Lakers, led by O'Neal's 41 points and 17 rebounds, won 106-102, setting the stage for Game 7 in Sacramento. There are allegations that the game was affected by the referees in relationship to the Tim Donaghy scandal. The Lakers shot 40 free throws overall, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, and the Kings' big men were plagued with foul trouble (Divac, Webber, Scot Pollard, and Lawrence Funderburke were called for 20 fouls, with Divac and Pollard both fouling out). Webber nearly had a triple double (26 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists), Bibby scored 23, and Divac had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Washington Post sports columnist Michael Wilbon responded to the calls in Game 6: [...] "I wrote <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> notebook six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship." [...] For example, Wilbon pointed out that Kobe Bryant did not get a foul called on him after elbowing Mike Bibby in front of an official.|$|E
