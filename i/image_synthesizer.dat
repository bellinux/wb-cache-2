5000|$|Harmor {{is powered}} by an {{additive}} synthesis engine, similar to <b>Image</b> Line’s <b>synthesizer</b> Morphine. Harmor’s engine differs in that it sums its component partials later in the signal chain than most additive synthesis engines, even past the filter stage. This creates a more particular sound when its partials are summed. This is especially true when its partials are altered through the filter stage or other effects. A more evolving and changing sound can be achieved due to this delayed summation of partials. Harmor also uses subtractive synthesis equally as effectively as it does additive. It can produce up to 516 partials per note, per unison sound. They also can be modified in real time through Harmor’s additive synthesis engine as described before. Imported audio (WAV, AIFF, WavPack, MP3, OGG, REX1&2) and image (.bmp, [...]jpg, [...]png, [...]gif) files can also be resynthesized quite extensively such as time stretching, pitch shifting, etc. When opened, Harmor’s spectrogram (visual feedback panel) shows partials sent the synthesis engine and displays their modulations in live time.|$|R

(c) Our algorithm synthesizes textures by reordering strips of the source image. Each result is a path in a graph describing the space of synthesizable images. Only the path need to be stored in memory. Decoding is performed during display, in the pixel shader. Textures are often reused on different surfaces in large virtual environments. This leads to unpleasing stretch and cropping of features when textures contain architectural elements. Existing retargeting methods could adapt each texture {{to the size of}} their support surface, but this would imply storing a different image for each and every surface, saturating memory. Our new texture synthesis approach casts synthesis as a shortest path problem in a graph describing the space of images that can be synthesized. Each path in the graph describes how to form a new image by cutting strips of the source image and reassembling them in a different order. Only the paths describing the result need to be stored in memory: synthesized textures are reconstructed at rendering time. The user can control repetition of features, and may specify positional constraints. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of textures, from facades for large city rendering to structured textures commonly used in video games. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is concerned with}} the development of a model to analyze a Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Synthesizer</b> (DIS) integrated circuit designed to create false target images to deceive Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR). The DIS is able to recreate the scattering effect of a moving target by using appropriate phase and gain modulations on an intercepted ISAR chirp signal before retransmitting it with the proper time delay. The DIS signal processing and the ISAR compression of the modulated return are modeled to examine the range-Doppler profile of a synthesized false target image. The image is representative of the image that would appear on an ISAR display. ISAR image quality is used to evaluate different DIS architectures and bit formats. Evaluation of the image quality is based on the deviation from an infinite resolution false target image. The results obtained from evaluating different DIS architectures indicate that the design is tolerant of significant quantization errors. The model is used to validate the architecture of the integrated circuit being fabricated. Finally, various different ISAR integration times and pulse repetition frequencies are used to confirm the integrity of the model. Lieutenant, Chilean Nav...|$|E

The DIS, a system-on-a-chip, is especially useful as a counter-targeting repeater. It synthesizes the characteristic echo signature of a pre-selected target. The VHDL description of the DIS architecture was exported from Tanner S-Edit, modified, and simulated. Different software oriented verification approaches were researched and a White-box approach to functional verification was adopted. An algorithm based on the hardware functionality was developed to compare expected and simulated results. Initially, the architecture of one Range Bin Modulator was exported. Modifications to the VHDL source code included modeling of the behavior of the NFET and P-FET transistors as well as Ground and Vdd (the voltages connected to the drains of the FETs). It also included renaming of entities to comply with VHDL naming conventions. Simulation results were compared to manual calculations and Matlab programs to verify the architecture. The procedure was repeated for the architecture of an Eight-Range Bin Modulator with equally successful results. VHDL was then used to create a super class of a 32 -Range Bin Modulator. Test vectors developed in Matlab were used to yet again verify correct functionality. Major, Swedish Arm...|$|E

40|$|A millimeter-wave (MMW) {{radar clutter}} <b>image</b> <b>synthesizer</b> {{that will create}} {{faithful}} polarimetric clutter images is being developed as a suite of PCI software applications known as SPRI, the Simulator of Polarimetric Radar Images. SPRI will enable the user to create new clutter images from ex-isting images, such as aerial photography or radar images from a sensor at a different frequency than that desired. The user can also create synthesized images from scratch. Since the techniques to implant hard targets are well developed, SPRI {{is expected to have}} application in automatic target recognition (ATR) development, sensor evaluation, and pos-sibly in soldier training. SPRI randomly generates a complex scattering matrix for each pixel in an image region which statistically satisfies a measured or derived Mueller matrix describing the clut-ter in that region. From the scattering matrix, radar cross sections per unit area of every pixel can be obtained for any transmit-receive polarization pair, as well as any other polarimetric quantity.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a novel sea clutter module to enhance the digital <b>image</b> <b>synthesizer</b> (DIS) integrated circuit, so that the false-target image generated will be more resistant to the electronic protection used within inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). The modified DIS design proposed incorporates the DIS false target with a sea clutter effect so that the interaction between the reflective surface of the target object and the background clutter is emulated. Furthermore, the random Doppler shift of the sea clutter derived from the novel DIS design can be used to ease the discontinuity in the cross-range domain. The DIS false-target image is then closer to that of a real target. The signal processing for the sea clutter module and the DIS and the ISAR compression of the modulated return are modeled to evaluate the performance of the modified DIS design. Such evaluation is based on investigating the discontinuity of the resultant target image in the cross-range domain and the correlation between the image and the background clutter. Finally, various radar wavelengths and sea states are used to verify the sea clutter is reasonably generated by the module under different environmental conditions. Also, different false-target profiles that represent the target in motion are used to confirm the integrity of the DIS design. Major, Air Force of Taiwa...|$|E

This dissertation investigates a mixed-signal, electronic warfare (EW) system-on-a-chip (SoC) design capable of synthesizing false radar returns {{in response to}} imaging radar interrogations that, when integrated into the range-Doppler processing, form {{an image of a}} false target. Detailed designs for the EW SoC components including the false target digital <b>image</b> <b>synthesizer</b> (DIS) and a novel analog to digital converter (ADC) are provided in this research. Alternative DIS architectures are presented that reduce circuit die area and power dissipation. This research also describes the theory, design, implementation, simulation, and testing of a proof-of-concept application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) providing automatic counterflow-clock pipeline skew control for the DIS. High performance ADCs are key components of mixed-signal SoCs. Design and simulation results for an 8 -bit 1 GS/s robust symmetric number system (RSNS) folding ADC are presented. The gray-code properties of the RSNS make it desirable for error control and low-power ADC implementations. A complete mathematical description of the N-modulus RSNS redundancies is discovered, which results in closed-form expressions for the longest sequence of unique RSNS vectors for moduli of the form m - 1, m, and m + 1, as well as an efficient search algorithm for N-modulus systems at least six orders of magnitude faster than previously published results.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the schematic design, simulation, and fabrication mask layout of a highspeed 16 -bit summation adder {{to be integrated}} into the Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Synthesizer</b> (DIS) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The DIS is a single-chip false target radar image generator to be used in countering wide band imaging radars. The DIS will calculate the false target image in 512 range bins. Each range bit utilizes two identical 16 -bit binary adders. The 16 -Bit Adder must compute the sum of two 16 -bit numbers, providing a 16 -bit sum, carry output, and overflow detection bit. The stated goal is for this adder to perform all of these functions in one pipeline stage while being clocked at 600 MHz. The first part of the design process includes an extensive analysis to utilize the fewest gates in designing the simplest adder that can achieve the 600 MHz goal. SPICE net lists are extracted from these schematic designs and simulations conducted to verify logic functionality and propagation speed. Mask layout of the verified design is constructed using a CMOS 0. 18 micron process utilizing deep submicron technology with six metal interconnect layers. The mask layout design is verified by ensuring all design rule checks (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) checks are satisfied. In aAddition, conclusions and recommendations are provided to assist other DIS project members in using this adder and the aforementioned design process for additional components of the DIS ASIC.

40|$|Reconstruction and {{monitoring}} of displacement and strain fields {{is an important}} problem in engineering. We analyze the remote and non-obtrusive methods of strain measurement based on photogrammetry and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The method is based on covering the photographed surface with a pattern of speckles and comparing the images taken {{before and after the}} deformation. In this study, a comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis of photogrammetric solutions is presented. The analysis is based on a specially developed Digital <b>Image</b> <b>Synthesizer</b> To Reconstruct Strain in Solids (DISTRESS) Simulator to generate synthetic images of displacement and stress fields in order to investigate the intrinsic accuracy of the existing variants of DIC. We investigated the Basic DIC and a commercial software VIC 2 D, both based on displacement field reconstruction with post processing strain determination based on numerical differentiation. We also investigated what we call the Extended DIC where the strain field is determined independently of the displacement field. While the Basic DIC and VIC 2 D are faster, the Extended DIC delivers the best accuracy of strain reconstruction. The speckle pattern is found to be playing a critical role in achieving high accuracy for DIC. Increase in subset size for DIC does not significantly improves the accuracy, while the smallest subset size depends on the speckle pattern and speckle size. Increase in the overall image size provides more details but does not play significant role in improving the accuracy, while significantly increasing the computation cost.

30|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been paid to the electromagnetic jamming and anti-jamming for radar system in the electronic countermeasure (ECM) community over the past two decades [1 – 5]. To prevent or complicate the radar target detection and recognition, much work has been done on the jamming techniques, especially some new jamming tricks that appear to counter the wideband radar system, such as the interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ) [1 – 9], false-target digital <b>image</b> <b>synthesizer</b> (DIS) [10 – 12], and scatter wave jamming (SWJ) [13 – 15]. As a coherent repeater jamming, ISRJ firstly proposed by Wang et al. [1] can induce a train of false targets after the pulse compression (PC) without completely sampling and storing the whole radar pulse. The method can be used by a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM)-based repeater jammer and has received growing attention from ECM community for its excellent jamming performances and advantages. Wang et al. [1] analyzed the relationship between ISRJ’s parameters and jamming effects. Besides, the time-domain, frequency-domain, and amplitude characteristics of ISRJ-based false targets were described in [2]. The induced false targets make it more difficult to detect and recognize the true target. Moreover, the jamming signal could cancel the echo of true target. Feng et al. [4] explored the three conditions that should be met for the cancelation of target echo, including the repeater power, delayed time, and repeater frequency. Moreover, since the false targets induced by ISRJ always contain the phase variation information for cross-range resolution, the jamming trick also has been employed to generate two-dimensional false image and has showed its potential against radar imaging [5 – 9]. Wang and Cai [5] proposed the intermittent sampling jamming to counter the bi- and multistatic synthetic aperture radars (SARs). To counter the inverse SAR (ISAR), a sub-Nyquist sampling jamming was proposed with the compressive sensing (CS)-based reconstruction algorithm [6]. Meanwhile, Pan et al. [7] investigated a CS-based matched filtering algorithm and applied it to the high-resolution range profile (HRRP) reconstruction of sub-Nyquist sampling jamming. In view of the induced false HRRP and image, ISRJ provides a complex countermeasure against the wideband radar to detect and recognize target.|$|E
