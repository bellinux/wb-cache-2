25|$|Almost <b>every</b> <b>color</b> of {{tourmaline}} can {{be found}} in Brazil, especially in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Bahia. In 1989, miners discovered a unique and brightly colored variety of tourmaline in the state of Paraíba. The new type of tourmaline, which soon became known as paraiba tourmaline, came in blue and green. Brazilian paraiba tourmaline usually contains abundant inclusions. Much of the paraiba tourmaline from Brazil actually comes from the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Norte. Material from Rio Grande do Norte is often somewhat less intense in color, but many fine gems are found there. It was determined that the element copper was important in the coloration of the stone.|$|E
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of <b>every</b> <b>color</b> to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|E

For <b>every</b> <b>coloring</b> of {{the edges of the}} countable triangle free homogeneous graph U with finitely many colors there exists a copy of U in U whose edges are colored with at most two of the colors. The countable triangle free homogeneous graph U is weakly edge indivisible, that is, for <b>every</b> <b>coloring</b> of the edges of U with two colors, say red and blue, the following holds: If there is a finite triangle free graph G so that every copy of G in U contains a red edge, then there is a copy of U in U which has red edges only...|$|R

25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where {{in the range of}} color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing <b>every</b> <b>color</b> grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|E
500|$|Sperner's lemma {{is a more}} {{advanced}} application of the same strategy. The lemma states that {{a certain kind of}} coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex that contains <b>every</b> <b>color.</b> Rather than directly construct such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such subsimplices through an induction argument. A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks down as [...] when one considers the two possible orientations of a simplex.|$|E
