25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the state}} {{apparatus}} was entirely Hungarian in language, as were business and social life above the lowest levels. The Magyarization of the towns had proceeded at an astounding rate. Nearly all middle-class Jews and Germans and many middle-class Slovaks and Ruthenes had been Magyarized. The percentage of the population with Hungarian as <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> grew from 46.6% in 1880 to 54.5% in 1910. The 1910 census (and the earlier censuses) did not register ethnicity, but mother tongue (and religion) instead, based on which it is sometimes subject to criticism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} language is Marathi although different regions {{have their own}} dialects. English is applicable in urban areas. Spoken Marathi language varies by district, area or locality in its tone and a few words. Konkani and Gujarati are also spoken in some areas. Other major dialects include Varhadii spoken in the Vidarbha region and Dangii spoken near the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. The sound [...] is abundantly used in many verbs and nouns in Marathi. It is replaced by the sound [...] in the Varhadii dialect, which makes it quite distinct. [...] According to the economic survey of Maharashtra (2008–09), {{the percentage of the}} state's population that names Marathi as <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> has declined to 68.8% from 76.5% over the past three decades, while there has been a sharp rise in the Hindi-speaking population (11% from 5%) in the same period.|$|E
6000|$|... (2) Children {{are kept}} back in {{learning}} language, if their teacher makes effort to come down, {{as it is}} called, to their comprehension {{in the use of}} words. Notice that I say, in the use of words, for as I shall show presently, it is absolutely necessary to come down to the comprehension of children, in some other respects. If however, in the use of words, those who address children, confine themselves to such words as children already understand, how are they to make progress in that most important of all studies, the knowledge of language. Many a mother keeps back her child, in this way, to a degree that is hardly conceivable; thus doing all in her power to perpetuate in the child an ignorance of <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The once {{universal}} {{practice of}} learning by rote, is daily falling more into discredit. All modern authorities condemn the old mechanical way of teaching the alphabet. The multiplication table is now frequently taught experimentally. In the acquirement of languages, the grammar-school plan is being superseded by plans {{based on the}} spontaneous process followed by the child in gaining <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b> Describing the methods there used, the [...] "Reports on the Training School at Battersea" [...] say:--"The instruction in the whole preparatory course is chiefly oral, and is illustrated {{as much as possible}} by appeals to nature." [...] And so throughout. The rote-system, like ether systems of its age, made more of the forms and symbols than of the things symbolised. To repeat the words correctly was everything; to understand their meaning nothing; and thus the spirit was sacrificed to the letter. It is at length perceived that, in this case as in others, such a result is not accidental but necessary--that in proportion as there is attention to the signs, there must be inattention to the things signified; or that, as Montaigne long ago said--Sçavoir par coeur n'est pas sçavoir.|$|E

Even then, it is possible to offer a <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> education through decentralized language planning that is based on a theoretically sound national policy as has been done in Ethiopia, a much poorer country (Skutnabb-Kangas and Heugh [2012]).|$|R

25|$|Andhra is characterised {{as having}} <b>its</b> own <b>mother</b> <b>tongue,</b> and <b>its</b> {{territory}} has been equated with {{the extent of}} the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern Ganjam District of Orissa and to the south by Kalahasti temple in Chittor District. But Andhra extended westwards as far as Srisailam in the Kurnool District, about halfway across the modern state. Page number-36. According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is Simhachalam and the southern limit is Tirupati or Tirumala Hill of the Telugu Country.|$|R

50|$|Centrally, Weisgerber {{contended that}} each {{language}} community {{was engaged in}} a process of 'wording the world' (Worten der Welt) by means of <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b> Mediating between the forms (i.e. words and grammatical structures) of a language and the external world, there was a 'linguistic inter-world' (sprachliche Zwischenwelt), which operates directly, indirectly and in part autonomously, in ways peculiar to that language. In acquiring a specific mother tongue, a speaker will also unconsciously acquire and be influenced by its distinctive categorizations and structures. These effects permeate the entire community and shape its perceived world.|$|E
