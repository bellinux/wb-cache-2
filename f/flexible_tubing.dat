25|$|Tubing and {{connections}} : Various kinds of tubing {{can be used}} to connect the components of the respirometry system to and from the animal chamber. A variety of kinds of <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> may be used, depending on the characteristics of the system. Acetyl, Bev-A-Line, Kynar, nylon, Tygon tubing and connectors may be used in regions of the system where oxidizing atmospheres are low (e.g., background levels of ozone only); Teflon tubing would be recommended if there is an expectation for appreciable amounts of ozone to be present because it is inert to ozone. Teflon tubes are more costly and lack flexibility.|$|E

2500|$|When using {{glassware}} it {{is often}} necessary to control the flow of fluid. [...] It is commonly stopped with a stopper. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware. [...] Types of interconnecting components include glass tubing, [...] T-connectors, Y-connectors, and glass adapters. [...] For a leak-tight connection a ground glass joints is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a Keck clips). [...] Another way to connect glassware is with a hose barb and <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing.</b> Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a valve, of which a stopcock is a common type fused to the glassware. Valves made entirely of glass {{may be used to}} restrict fluid flows. Fluid, or any material which flows, can be directed into a narrow opening using a funnel.|$|E

5000|$|Tygon is a {{brand name}} {{for a family of}} <b>flexible</b> polymer <b>tubing</b> {{consisting}} of a variety of materials to be used [...] "across a range of specialized fluid transfer requirements". The specific composition of each type is a trade secret. Some variants have multiple layers of different materials. Tygon is a registered trademark of Saint-Gobain Corporation. It is an invented word, owned and used by Saint-Gobain and originated in the late 1930s. Tygon products are produced in three countries, but sold throughout the world. Tygon tubing is used in many markets, including food and beverage, chemical processing, industrial, laboratory, medical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor processing. There are many formulations of clear, <b>flexible,</b> Tygon <b>tubing.</b> The chemical resistance and physical properties vary among the different formulations, but the tubing generally is intended to be [...] "so resistant to chemical attack that it will handle practically any chemical", whether liquid, gas, or slurry. [...] Users should be cautious to match the characteristics of the tubing being considered with their own specific requirements.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in distal {{resistance}} on stenotic resistance were studied in vitro. Physiological saline was passed through the left carotid artery obtained from the dog, <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>tubing,</b> or through solid polyethylene tubing with a constant perfusion pressure or with a constant flow rate. Various stenotic resistances were established using a screw type constrictor and the distal resistance was varied by allowing physiological saline to pass through either a 23 gauge hypodermic needle (high peripheral resistance) or 23 and 20 gauge needles (low peripheral resistance). For arteries with anatomically fixed stenosis, the calculated resistance was increased in association with reduction of the distal resistance. The stenotic resistance in the <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>tubing</b> changed {{in the same manner}} as that of the carotid artery, while the solid polyethylene tubing showed no significant stenotic resistance changes due to altering the distal resistance. These findings suggest that the stenotic resistance change of the artery correlates with the elasticity of the vessel wall and also indicate that resistance values were of little usefulness for evaluating the effects of vasodilating stimuli on the vessel segment with a significant stenosis. </p...|$|R

50|$|Milton M.

50|$|A Büchner flask, {{also known}} as a vacuum flask, filter flask, suction flask, {{side-arm}} flask or Kitasato flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a short glass tube and hose barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled <b>flexible</b> hose (<b>tubing)</b> can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner flask.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} is with <b>flexible</b> (layflat) <b>tubing</b> where the archimedean spiral {{acts as a}} peristaltic pump, which operates on much the same principle as a toothpaste tube. They have casings filled with lubricant to prevent abrasion of {{the exterior of the}} pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called 'hoses'. This class of pump is often called a 'hose pumper'. Since there are no moving parts in contact with the fluid, peristaltic pumps are inexpensive to manufacture. Their lack of valves, seals and glands makes them comparatively inexpensive to maintain, and the hose or tube is a low-cost maintenance item compared to other pump types.|$|R
50|$|CSST is not FAC (<b>Flexible</b> Appliance Connector) <b>tubing.</b> Presently, CSST and FAC tubing both use {{corrugated}} {{stainless steel}} tubing. In the past, FAC used corrugated brass tubing. However, FAC tubing is made only in lengths of 1 to 6 feet, FAC tubing {{is made with}} connectors on each end, and FAC tubing {{does not have a}} plastic sheath. On FAC tubing the corrugations are visible. CSST’s plastic sheath covers its corrugations.|$|R
5000|$|LLDPE has {{penetrated}} {{almost all}} traditional markets for polyethylene; {{it is used}} for plastic bags and sheets (where it allows using lower thickness than comparable LDPE), plastic wrap, stretch wrap, pouches, toys, covers, lids, pipes, buckets and containers, covering of cables, geomembranes, and mainly <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing.</b> In 2013, the world market for LLDPE reached a volume of $40 billion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{butterfly}} offers {{advantages over}} a simple straight needle. The butterfly's <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> reaches more body surface and tolerates more patient movement. The butterfly's precise placement facilitates venipuncture of thin, [...] "rolling", fragile, or otherwise poorly accessible veins. The butterfly's shallow-angle insertion design facilitates venipuncture of very superficial veins, e.g. hand, wrist, or scalp veins (hence name [...] "scalp vein" [...] set).|$|E
50|$|Flexible {{metallic}} conduit (FMC, informally called greenfield or flex) {{is made by}} the helical coiling of a self-interlocked ribbed strip of aluminum or steel, forming a hollow tube through which wires can be pulled. FMC is used primarily in dry areas {{where it would be}} impractical to install EMT or other non-flexible conduit, yet where metallic strength to protect conductors is still required. The <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> does not maintain any permanent bend, and can flex freely.|$|E
5000|$|Tube: The outer {{plastic tube}} {{is also an}} {{important}} feature that greatly affects the end use of any rope light. A rope light with relatively wider plastic tubing is more durable to external elements but less <b>flexible.</b> Thinner plastic <b>tubing,</b> on the other hand, is far more flexible but less robust. Generally, rope lights for heavy use outdoors feature thicker plastic casings while those used for more decorative purposes indoors have relatively thin plastic casings.|$|R
30|$|We used {{capillaries}} with inner diameters 0.25 and 0.60  mm, respectively. This {{size was}} chosen to reflect the applications as outlined in the introduction, and represents an intermediate value between the fracture short circuit oil recovery regime (ca. 100  μm) on one hand (van Heel et al., 2008) as in “Fracture/matrix flow” above, and the geothermal and hydraulic fracturing (Turcott and Schubert 1982) (ca. 1  mm) on the other. The capillaries are made of stainless steel and glued in <b>flexible</b> polyurethane <b>tubing</b> to prevent bending and for easy installation in the experiment. The CTAB and NaSal were dissolved in deionised water. We denote the concentrations as [CTAB]/[NaSal] where [CTAB] and [NaSal] are the concentrations CTAB and NaSal in milli-moles/l. A representative brine was 3 wt % NaCl (roughly seawater).|$|R
40|$|A {{hand held}} {{hydraulic}} cutting tool was developed which is particularly useful in deactivating ejection seats in military aircraft rescue operations. The tool consists primarily of a hydraulic system {{composed of a}} fluid reservoir, a pumping piston, and an actuator piston. Mechanical cutting jaws {{are attached to the}} actuator piston rod. The hydraulic system is controlled by a pump handle. As the pump handle is operated the actuator piston rod is forced outward and thus the cutting jaws are forced together. The frame of the device is a <b>flexible</b> metal <b>tubing</b> which permits easy positioning of the tool cutting jaws in remote and normally inaccessible locations. Bifurcated cutting edges ensure removal of a section of the tubing or cable to thereby reduce the possibility of accidental reactivation of the tubing or cable being severed...|$|R
50|$|Hair {{simulator}} {{capable of}} simulating dynamic forces acting on {{long hair and}} per-hair collisions. Often used to simulate computationally complex human hair styles including pony tails, perms and braids. The simulation utilizes NURBS curves as a base which are then used as strokes for Paint Effects brushes thereby giving the curves a render time surface-like representation that can interact with light and shadow. A simulation on the curves alone for other, non-hair purposes (such as <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing,</b> cables, ropes, etc.) is often known simply as Dynamic Curves.|$|E
50|$|The garment is {{typically}} a close-fitting non-stretching fabric or a tight-fitting elastic fabric, with <b>flexible</b> <b>tubing</b> sewn onto the fabric. A single-layer of fabric may be used, with the tubing {{either on the}} inside directly contacting the wearer's skin, or on the outside separated by the fabric. If two layers of fabric are used, stitched channels can be formed which enclose the tubing between the two fabric layers. Where flame resistance is needed, the garment may be constructed out of materials such as nomex.|$|E
5000|$|A 20 ft high wooden {{platform}} {{was constructed}} 800 yd to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (...) and 108 LT of TNT were stacked {{on top of}} it.

40|$|The {{diversity}} and abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in agricultural soils is often relatively low. Their utilization {{as part of}} an integrated agricultural approach to decrease agrochemical inputs thus needs the mass production of high quality AM fungal inoculum. Such production is however currently still complicated and costly. In addition, the ecology of AM fungi remains faintly understood and necessitates further research. This would allow the optimisation of AM fungal inoculum production and could assure their appropriate use and safe introduction into the field. Two new in vitro plant-based cultivation systems for AM fungi were developed during this thesis. The first system allowed the fast colonization of young plantlets, based on their root growth in an actively growing AM hyphal network that was extending from a adult mycorrhized donor plant. Thousands of spores were produced per newly mycorrhized plant in a few weeks time after these plants was transferred onto a fresh culture medium. These plants thus represented a promising starter inoculum to initiate the mass production of AM fungi and were subsequently used in an innovative low-cost in vitro cultivation system. This second system, a semi-hydroponic plant-based bioreactor for the production of AM fungi, consisted of a sterilised growth tube connected at both extremities to <b>flexible</b> <b>tubings</b> to circulate the liquid culture medium. A first test demonstrated the potential of the system for the production of AM fungal propagules. AM fungal ecology under plant-stress (i. e. defoliation) conditions was also investigated. We confirmed that two species belonging to phylogenetically distant genera (i. e. Scutellospora and Glomus) differed in their life history strategy (LHS). Repeated defoliation of Medicago truncatula revealed that S. reticulata more closely resembles K-strategists than r-strategists, and vice versa for G. intraradices. Such differences may influence inoculum production and its subsequent effectiveness in the field and is thus requesting the selection of adequate AM fungi. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
5000|$|A winged {{infusion}} set—also {{known as}} [...] "butterfly" [...] or [...] "scalp vein" [...] set—is a device specialized for venipuncture: i.e. for accessing a superficial vein for either intravenous injection or phlebotomy. It consists, {{from front to}} rear, of a hypodermic needle, two bilateral flexible [...] "wings", <b>flexible</b> small-bore transparent <b>tubing</b> (often 20-35 cm long), and lastly a connector (often female Luer).
