Feeding rumen bypass {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) affects to Japanese Black cows affects their reproduction, though {{its influence on}} superovulatory response in donor cows and conception in recipient cattle has not been well studied. Here, we investigated the effects of feeding PUFA to Japanese Black cows on blood biochemistry, the numbers of <b>ova</b> and <b>embryos</b> or transferable embryos and preg-nancy rate following embryo transfer (ET) to recipient Holstein heifers. PUFA (40 % linoleic acid) was fed at 300 g/day {{in the experimental group}} from the last day of estrus until the day of artificial insemination for superovulatory treatment. Blood was collected {{on the first day of}} follicle-stimulating hormone administration. Total cholesterol level was significantly higher in the 15 - to 19 -day feeding group (117. 4 mg/ dl) than in the control group (95. 0 mg/dl). The numbers of <b>ova</b> and <b>embryos</b> or transferable embryos were significantly higher in the 15 - to 19 -day feeding group than in the control group. The numbers of transferable embryos in the 15 - to 19 -day feeding group were significantly higher than in the 10 - to 14 -day feeding group. The pregnancy rate at day 60 was significantly higher in the experimental group (66. 7 and 57. 1 %) than in the control group (51. 1 and 44. 0 %) after transfer of fresh and frozen-thawed embryos, respectively. In conclusion, the numbers of <b>ova</b> and <b>embryos</b> or transferable embryos after superovulatory treatment increased, and the pregnancy rate after ET was highe...|$|R

40|$|A {{primary purpose}} of {{regulation}} is to secure public trust. In the United Kingdom in the 1990 s public trust in those who procured, stored and used human tissues for research or other purposes was severely damaged following controversies about the retention and use of post mortem organs and tissue at the Bristol Royal Infirmary and the Alder Hey Royal Infirmary in Liverpool. Pathologists at both hospitals had retained large quantities of tissue and other remains of children without the knowledge and consent of their parents. Reports of unacceptable practices in Bristol and Alder Hey led to major revision of laws and regulation {{of the use of}} all human tissue in the context of research and therapy, including the donation and transplantation of human organs. A new regulatory authority, the Human Tissue Authority, was set up. Together with the previously established Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority these two public bodies have had responsibility for key aspects of the regulation and oversight of human tissue use for research in the United Kingdom. Here we explore their role in securing public trust and confidence in current practices relating to research use of human tissue. These practices include the use of <b>ova,</b> <b>embryos</b> and aborted fetal tissue for stem cell research and most recently the approved use of “human admixed embryos”. We discuss the ethical principles underlying the current policies and legal frameworks in the UK regarding the research use of human tissue and their divergence from other European countries...|$|R
40|$|Conditions for {{importation}} of laboratory {{rats and mice}} were reviewed in 1998 and the current conditions were issued in June 1999 (AQPM 1999 / 043). Since that time, several requests have been made for {{importation of}} mouse embryos and semen {{with a view to}} gaining access to special strains of mice for research purposes. The importation of <b>embryos,</b> <b>ova</b> and semen in lieu of live animals is promoted as being inherently safer from a biosecurity perspective. Many agents of concern are not transmitted vertically via in-utero transmission to the embryo or foetus. Many may not be transmitted via semen. Thus, there may be a lower risk than live animal importation. This document reviews the disease risks involved in importation of mouse <b>embryos,</b> <b>ova</b> and semen and discusses options for extending the current conditions for live laboratory rats and mice to include these products. This review is limited to the species Mus musculus, Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Its scope is also limited to animals kept under laboratory conditions- rats or mice reared as pets could carry a range of pathogens significantly wider than animals reared in laboratories. This document also reviews the use of source colony disease status (as an alternative to post arrival quarantine and testing) as a means of ensuring that imported animals, <b>embryos,</b> <b>ova</b> or semen are free of the agents of concern.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the number of}} {{endangered}} animals, both referred to livestock and wild species, has grown enormously. The “livestock” term refers to animals domesticated for producing commodities for man such as food, fiber and draught. Livestock biodiversity is integral to our culture, history, environment, and economy. Thousands of livestock breeds have evolved over time to suit particular environments and farming systems. Conservation and analyses of these genetic resources rely on demographic characterization and correct breeding schemes. In addition, molecular genetic studies allow to identify and monitor the genetic diversity within and across breeds and to reconstruct their evolution history. The conservation of livestock variability is also a crucial element {{in order to preserve}} and valorise specific nutritional and nutraceutical properties of animal products. Efficient ex situ and in situ conservation strategies, as well as the creation of bio-banks and specific biotechnological and bioinformatics tools for genetic analyses and digital preservation, are obligatory requirements in order to implement an appropriate action for the conservation of animal biodiversity. The main issues concerning different species are summarised, with particular reference to the livestock biodiversity still existing. Some examples of ex situ conservation strategies, which mainly refer to cryoconservation of semen, <b>ova,</b> <b>embryos</b> or tissues, developed in Italy, are presented, and the different actions in defense of Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) developed within the European Community are illustrated. Interestingly, the same strategies for biological and digital analyses and preservation of livestock biodiversity can be exported to wild endangered animals in order to plan a correct conservation and repopulation of the species. Furthermore, the European Union has set up the guidelines to safeguard the biodiversity and to combat the extinction of animal species, and has made the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems one of the main objectives of the Sixth Environment Action Programme. </p...|$|R

The present study aimed at evaluating {{the effect of the}} ultra rapid cryopreservation (vitrification) technique, followed by slow or fast thawing protocol, on the fertilized <b>ova,</b> 4 -cell <b>embryos</b> and morula. MethodsThe vitrification method included equilibrating the ova in the vitrification solution (EFS 40; consisted of 40 % ethylene glycol, 30 % Ficoll, 0. 5 M sucrose in D-PBS) for 2 minutes before immersion in liquid nitrogen. Slow and fast thawing were done and the cryoprotectants were withdrawn by a hyperosmolar sucrose solution, which was then gradually diluted and replaced by culture medium. ResultsThe best results were obtained with vitrification of the 4 -cell embryos both with slow and fast thawing, which gave survival rate of 86 % and 94 %, and in vitro development rate of 74 % and 80 %, respectively. Fast thawing showed better survival rates (80 %, 94 %, 77 %) and better in vitro development rates (60 %, 80 %, 63 %) than those of slow thawing, following vitrification of the fertilized <b>ova,</b> 4 -cell <b>embryos</b> and morula, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pregnant}} mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) dose and PMSG antiserum on superovulation in crossbred beef cows were studied. In experiment I, three groups {{were treated with}} 1200, 2400 or 3600 IU of PMSG and 48 h later with prostaglandin (PGF). The mean numbers of corpora lutea (CL), unovulated follicles, and total ova/embryos collected increased as the PMSG dose increased. The percent of fertilized <b>ova</b> and transferable <b>embryos</b> was lowest in the highest dose group (p < 0. 05). In experiment II, all cows received 2500 IU of PMSG; groups 1 and 2 were treated with sheep anti-PMSG serum at 48 h or 60 h after PGF; group 3 cows were PMSG-only controls. The number of CL was lowest and the number of unovulated follicles highest in the PMSG-only group (p < 0. 05). The number of CL was higher in group 2 (anti-PMSG at 60 h) than in the control group, with the anti-PMSG at 48 h not different from the other groups. Numbers of total ova/embryos, fertilized <b>ova,</b> and transferable <b>embryos</b> were higher (p < 0. 05) in both antiserum-treated groups relative to the PMSG-only group. We conclude that superovulation of beef cows with PMSG and treatment with PMSG antiserum will induce a higher superovulatory response and will result in higher CL numbers and fewer unovulated follicles. Further, the variability in the superovulatory response to PMSG treatment was still evident when PMSG antiserum was administered...|$|R

The total numbers of pups born alive per dam and somatic development, estimated by weighing and measuring the crown-rump length, were recorded. Superovulation response was evaluated in outbreed females. Litter size differed among endogamic dams, irrespective of the sire. Somatic development results suggest heterosis and imprinting phenomena, once a differential parental effect was demonstrated. There was no difference in corpora lutea, <b>ova</b> or <b>embryos</b> recovered (P > 0. 05), but recovery and viability rates differ among F 1 groups (P < 0. 05). The association of dam prolificity with somatic development and superovulation response of the pups should be considered for experimental F 1 populations establishment.

40|$|Clinical {{medicine}} and biotechnology increasingly utilise and transform human bodily tissues in novel ways. Today {{more and more}} tissues [...] blood, whole organs, <b>ova,</b> <b>embryos,</b> sperm, skin, bone, heart valves, cellular material, bone marrow and corneas [...] can be transferred between donors and recipients. Hence {{more and more people}} in developed nations have the experience of giving a fragment of their body to another, or receiving such a fragment as part of some kind of therapy. These systems for the circulation of tissues raise the question of what we have termed 'bioidentity'. Bioidentity describes our common-sense understanding of our bodies as 'ours', as both supporting and being included in our social and subjective identities. Within this framework, how are we to understand the status of detachable bodily fragments like blood, ova or organs? As parts of our bodies do they retain a trace of our identity after donation, or are they detachable things? What is our relationship, if any, to the patient who receives our tissues as part of their treatment? This paper investigates the specific case of blood transfusion and donation. It draws upon in depth interviews with 55 people who have specific experience with blood. They either have hepatitis C (are HCV+) acquired by transfusion or intravenous drug use, or have donated blood or received a blood transfusion but are free of hepatitis C (are HCV-). We analyse this material according to the themes [...] Donated Blood as 'Self', Blood as Alienable, Blood as Communal Substance, and Contaminated Gifts and the Blood of Strangers. We find that, generally speaking the HCV+ and HCV- groups share very similar ideas about blood donation and transfusion. For a minority of both groups, blood was understood as a decisive site of self irrespective of location, but for the remainder donated blood was either ambiguous with regard to identity, a shared substance, or not considered to have any lingering relationship to the self once given. However both groups regarded blood as strongly imbued with 'risk identity'. In particular the HCV+ interviewees regarded their blood as a dangerous personal attribute, one that they must be careful to withhold from circulation, whereas the blood donors felt obliged to donate their blood precisely because they considered it clean and risk free.

Twenty mature does (mean body weight of 55 kg) were synchronised for oestrus with the aid of CIDR devices for a period of 17 days and superovulated with pFSH (Folltropin®-Vetrepharm) during the natural breeding season (n = 9) and non-breeding season (n = 11). The superovulation treatment entailed a total dose of 200 mg pFSH/doe given i. m. in 7 dosages at 12 h intervals, starting 48 h prior to CIDR removal (the first dose being 50 mg and all others 25 mg). Does were observed for signs of oestrous behaviour 3 times daily at 8 h intervals following CIDR withdrawal with the aid of teaser bucks to determine the onset and duration of the induced oestrous period. Cervical inseminations with 0. 1 ml fresh undiluted semen were performed 36 and 48 h following CIDR removal and the embryos surgically flushed 6 days following the second AI. Recovered structures (<b>ova</b> and <b>embryos)</b> were microscopically evaluated and classified according to their morphology. The total number of structures in terms of unfertilised ova, fertilised <b>ova,</b> degenerated <b>embryos</b> and transferable embryos from each doe flushed was recorded. All the donor does exhibited oestrus during the breeding and non-breeding season with the mean period to the onset of oestrus (24. 9 ± 4. 8 h) being significantly (P < 0. 05) earlier during the natural breeding season, compared to the non-breeding season (30. 5 ± 9. 1 h). The duration of the induced oestrous period was also significantly (P < 0. 05) longer during the natural breeding season (24. 0 ± 5. 7 h) than the non-breeding season (18. 2 ± 3. 7 h). The mean ovulation rate per donor, total number of structures and embryos recovered per donor did not differ between seasons. The mean number of unfertilised ova per doe was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher during the non-breeding season (3. 3 ± 2. 8), compared to the natural breeding season (0. 9 ± 2. 4). The total number of degenerated embryos and transferable embryos however, did not differ between seasons.

Pieces of ovarian tissue of week-old Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were frozen at 0. 58 C/min in a programmable freezer or vitrified by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Straws containing slow-frozen samples were thawed in ice water, and vitrified samples were removed from the vials and transferred into sucrose, with the concentration lowered in sequence at room temperature. Cell viability of tissue was estimated by trypan blue assay, and tissue histology was examined by light microscopy. Frozen-thawed or vitrified-warmed tissue from WB (recessive plumage color) chicks was transplanted into week-old ovariectomized QO (wild-type plumage) chicks, with some chicks receiving fresh tissue as a control group. At sexual maturity, QO recipients were mated to WB males, and the production of WB offspring demonstrated successful cryopres-ervation and transplantation. Donor-derived offspring were obtained from the ovarian tissue that had been cryopreserved by either slow-freezing or vitrification. The vitrification protocol used in this study showed better outcomes at each level of evaluation.

60|$|Having {{said this}} {{much on the}} {{equalisation}} of the sexes, it may be well to add a few remarks on the regulation through natural selection of the ordinary fertility of species. Mr. Herbert Spencer has shewn in an able discussion[409] that with all organisms a ratio exists between what he calls individuation and genesis; whence it follows that beings which consume much matter or force in their growth, complicated structure or activity, or which produce <b>ova</b> and <b>embryos</b> of large size, or which expend much energy in nurturing their young, cannot be so productive as beings of an opposite nature. Mr. Spencer further shews that minor differences in fertility will be regulated through natural selection. Thus the fertility of each species will tend to increase, from the more fertile pairs producing {{a larger number of}} offspring, and these from their mere number will have the best chance of surviving, and will transmit their tendency to greater fertility. The only check to a continued augmentation of fertility in each organism seems to be either the expenditure of more power and the greater risks run by the parents that produce a more numerous progeny, or the contingency of very numerous eggs and young being produced of smaller size, or less vigorous, or subsequently not so well nurtured. To strike a balance in any case between the disadvantages which follow from the production of a numerous progeny, and the advantages (such as the escape of at least some individuals from various dangers) is quite beyond our power of judgment.|$|R

In addition, I measured the relationship between reduction in food intake and the total volume of offspring or testis. A reduction in food intake proportional to the volume of offspring suggests that costs associated with reduced energy intake may be fecundity dependent. Food intake was estimated using the total volume of stomach contents of individuals. Females ate significantly less (mean volume of stomach contents = 0. 13 mL) than males (mean = 0. 36 mL) just before parturition in January, when embryos were largest. After parturition, females ate significantly more than males. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the food intake of males and females. Females reduced food intake by eating smaller food items. Females with relatively large numbers of <b>ova</b> or <b>embryos</b> ate relatively less, and therefore decreased food intake in females may be a fecundity-dependent cost of reproduction in these lizards. Males did not reduce food intake during periods when testes were enlarged and mating occurred. Decreased food intake during reproduction is probably an important source of reproductive costs to females of these viviparous lizards, but does not appear to be important in males...|$|R
40|$|A {{morphological}} {{study revealed}} that the NW American soft-bottom bivalve Nutricola tantilla is dioe-cious, not a protandric hermaphrodite as previously reported. We base this conclusion on the smaller males having highly specialized, glandular sperm ducts, while the larger females have simple oviducts and no transition between the two ducts occurs. The females are brooders and retain their ova in a mar-supium within the dorsal part of the inner demibranchs. Sperm cells were present and associated with a mesh-like tissue among the <b>ova</b> or early-stage <b>embryos.</b> How this tissue originates is still unknown. We suggest that sperm cells dissociate from this pool and fertilize the oocytes {{as soon as they}} are ovulated. The mode of sperm storage in N. tantilla represents a unique case in that the sperm are presumably nur-tured within a nonepithelial tissue. We describe the ultrastructure of the sperm cells in N. tantilla. Large, spherical cytophores become associated with a multitude of acrosomes of spermatozoa and probably represent the precursors of the spermatozeugmata that have been described previously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of exogenous progesterone on superovulatory response and ova/embryo quality in Bos indicus donors superstimulated during the first follicular wave (FFW). We hypothesized that exogenous progesterone during gonadotropin treatments would improve <b>ova</b> and <b>embryo</b> quality. In Experiment 1, 18 Nelore cows were randomly allocated to three groups: (1) FFW; (2) FFW plus a progesterone-releasing device (FFW+P 4); and (3) control (E 2 +P 4). Cows in the FFW groups were superstimulated beginning at synchronized ovulation, whereas cows {{in the control group}} were superstimulated after synchronization of follicular wave emergence with estradiol plus progesterone (E 2 +P 4). There were no differences in mean (± SD) numbers of transferable embryos between FFW+P 4 (8. 0 ± 4. 5) and control (6. 7 ± 4. 8) groups, but both were higher (P = 0. 006) than the FFW group (0. 2 ± 0. 4). In Experiment 2, FFW and FFW+P 4 were compared in 20 Nelore donors; exogenous progesterone increased the number of transferable embryos (3. 9 ± 3. 4 vs. 1. 3 ± 4. 1, P = 0. 003). In Experiment 3, FFW and FFW+P 4 were compared in 10 Nelore donors except that cows were slaughtered 12 h after pLH (Lutropin-V®, Bioniche Animal Health, Belleville, ON, Canada) treatment. More mature cumulus oocyte complex (COC) (expanded cumulus cell layers) were collected in the FFW+P 4 group than in the FFW group (21. 8 ± 13. 1 vs. 10. 8 ± 14. 7; P = 0. 003). In summary, superovulatory response was satisfactory when FSH (Folltropin-V®, Bioniche Animal Health) treatment was initiated at emergence of the first follicular wave in Nelore (Bos indicus) donors, and the hypothesis that administration of exogenous progesterone during the treatment will improve oocyte and embryo quality was supported...|$|R
40|$|Embryo {{recovery}} rate in superovulated cows after uterine flushing {{is lower than}} the ovulation rate, which contributes to the relative inefficiency of the conventional cervical recovery procedure. A simple and easy alternative to improve embryo {{recovery rate}} is the uterine re-flushing procedure. To evaluate the effect of re-flushing and the influence of breed and operator on bovine embryo recovery rate, 38 Nelore and 19 Jersey females were stimulated using FSH, with embryos being collected by one of two trained operators. At the end of flushing, the catheter was sealed and maintained into the uterine body, filled with flushing medium, while females were released to a paddock for 30 to 50 min, to be submitted to the re-flushing procedure by the same operator. A total of 599 structures were recovered out of 57 procedures, from which 423 (70. 6 %) were obtained in the first flushing and 176 (29. 4 %) after re-flushing. Mean recovery rates of 7. 4 and 3. 1 structures were obtained after the first and second flushing, respectively, for a total of 10. 5 structures per cow. Structures were obtained in 73. 6 % (42 out of 57) of the re-flushing procedures. No breed effect was observed on total <b>ova</b> or <b>embryo</b> recovery, with 10. 9 total ova collected from Jersey and 10. 3 from Nelore females. Likewise, the embryo recovery rate obtained following uterine flushing or re-flushing did not differ either between Jersey (8. 1 and 2. 7) and Nelore (7. 0 and 3. 2) animals, or between operators A (7. 5 and 3. 3) and B (7. 3 and 2. 9), respectively. In conclusion, the uterine re-flushing procedure significantly increased the rate of embryo recovery in Jersey and Nelore females, with no operator influence being observed...|$|R
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{mackerel}} sharks, the pelagic thresher is ovoviviparous. It gives birth to two pups at a time (rarely just one), one per uterus. With no defined breeding season, most adult females are pregnant throughout the year; the gestation period is uncertain, but has been suggested to be less than one year as in the common thresher. The developing embryos are sustained by a yolk sac until they are 12 cm (4.7 in) long, after which they are oophagous and feed on egg capsules produced by the mother. Each capsule measures about 55 mm (2.2 in) long and 12 mm (0.5 in) across, and contains 20 - 30 <b>ova.</b> Early stage <b>embryos</b> have specialized teeth for opening the capsules, while later-stage embryos have their teeth hidden and swallow the capsules whole, their teeth not becoming functional again until just after birth. No evidence of sibling cannibalism has been found as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Young pelagic threshers are born unusually large, up to 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long or 43% the length of the mother, which likely reduces predation on the newborns.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. As most {{researchers}} have foreseen, and many breeders have hoped, the in vivo and in vitro production of livestock embryos {{and the birth}} of subsequent offspring never really replaced artificial insemination during the past 30 years. This was, to a large extent, due to very variable and unreliable numbers of embryos produced using these two methods. The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate certain aspects of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) to try and solve some of these difficulties. Problems addressed were the management of follicular development on the ovary by controlling the dominant follicle, and investigating alternative and more cost-effective culture media and conditions for embryo culture. A method to control the development of the dominant follicle in a cohort of follicles as well as the waves of follicular development in the ovaries of sheep, goats and cows with an estrogenic product was investigated. Estradiol cypionate (ECP) was used for this purpose, injected intramuscularly after the insertion of the progesterone or progestagen implant. ECP has a negative feedback effect on the secretion of pituitary FSH, and therefore follicular development. The animals of the three different species were randomly divided into two groups each, the ECP-group receiving the estradiol cypionate injection, and the control group receiving a saline injection. Five days after the ECP injection a program of follicular multi-stimulation with FSH hormone was initiated. The females of the different species were bred by either natural service (goats) or inseminated by laparoscopy (sheep) or trans-cervically (cows) to fertilize the ovulated <b>ova.</b> <b>Embryos</b> and unfertilized <b>ova</b> were collected surgically at the 8 to 16 - cell stage 3 to 4 d after breeding in the sheep and goats, and trans-cervically in the cows. Significantly more CL formed, and a total number of <b>ova</b> and <b>embryos,</b> as well as transferable embryos, were collected from the ECP-group of sheep ewes and goat does compared to the control group that received no ECP (p 0. 05) were found in the number of Grade 1 pre-compacted bovine embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage, or the hatched blastocyst stage, neither for the culture medium used, or the method of culturing in the two incubators. Neither was there any difference (p> 0. 05) in the number of blastomeres that developed at the blastocyst stage between the two types of incubators used. Embryos tended to develop more blastomeres when cultured in BAF than when cultured in TCM- 199 in both the standard laboratory incubator and when using the vagina of a goat doe as an incubator (p< 0. 05). After the collection of in vivo produced livestock embryos, they are evaluated under high magnification (minimum of 80 X) with the aid of an inverted or stereo microscope. The Grade 1 embryos will give the best conception results when transferred to synchronized recipient female animals, while the Grade 3 embryos will give the worst results. The aim of the next experiment was to culture all three quality grades of in vivo produced pre-compacted morula-stage embryos of sheep, goats and cows in two different culture media and then compare the development of the embryos by evaluating the number of embryos reaching the hatched blastocyst stage. The results have shown that {{there were no significant differences}} between the development of the Grade 1 and the Grade 2 embryos from any of the three species when either cultured in TCM- 199 or heat inactivated early pregnancy-stage (< 60 d) bovine amniotic fluid (BAF) were used as culture media. Significantly more in vivo produced Grade 3 pre-compacted morula-stage sheep, goat and cow embryos, however, developed to the hatched blastocyst stage when cultured in BAF with 10 % FBS and antibiotics, compared to culture in TCM- 199 with 10 % FBS and antibiotics (p< 0. 05). The effect of co-culture on the survival of caprine embryos post transfer to a synchronized recipient female goat was also assessed. A total of 120 Kashmir embryos at the blastocyst stage were divided into three groups after thawing and reconstitution in four steps in glycerol and sucrose medium. The first group of embryos (G 1, n= 40) was individually transferred semi laparoscopically in D-PBS with 10 % FBS and antibiotics to the ipsilateral horn of the CL over a period of 3 d. The second group of caprine blastocysts (G 2, n= 40) was similarly transferred in TCM- 199 with FBS and antibiotics. The third group of frozen-thawed caprine blastocyst-stage embryos (G 3, n= 40) were first co-cultured for ~ 24 h in TCM- 199 with serum and antibiotics in groups of up to five embryos inside a ~ 50 mm length of a semen straw in a cylindrical sponge in the anterior part of the vagina of a goat doe in her luteal phase. After the culture period these embryos were transferred in a similar way in TCM- 199 without the co-culture as in G 1 and G 2. Ultrasound scanning showed that significantly more of the blastocyst embryos that were cocultured in the vagina (G 3) before transfer developed to a pregnancy compared with the embryos transferred in D-PBS (G 1). The co-culture Group 3 blastocyst-stage caprine embryos produced significantly more offspring than the non-cultured embryos transferred in both D-PBS (G 1) and TCM- 199 (G 2) (p< 0. 05). The maturation of bovine oocytes to allow the oocyte to resume meiosis, is the first step in in vitro fertilization to produce IVMFC embryos. The composition of the maturation medium plays an important role in the success achieved with maturation. An investigation was therefore launched to evaluate the maturation ability of first trimester bovine amniotic fluid (BAF) to mature prophase I oocytes collected from abattoir ovaries to metaphase II oocytes, compared to a standard maturation medium such as TCM- 199. In the first experiment three groups of ~ 100 oocytes each were matured in TCM- 199 with estrus cow serum (ECS). The first group of oocytes was matured in a 50 μL micro-drop in an incubator, while the other two groups were matured in semen straws, one group in an incubator and the other group in the vagina of a goat doe in di-estrus. Six further groups of ~ 100 oocytes each, with BAF as maturation medium, three groups with ECS and three without ECS, were matured in the same receptacles and under the same conditions as with the TCM- 199. No significant differences in number of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage could be found for any of the nine treatment groups. In the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Studies on the live-bearing scorpaenid genus Sebastes have {{recently}} shown that embryos of one species receive nutrition {{in addition to}} that supplied in the yolk. In this large genus, however, reproductive characteristics may differ among species. Energetics of embryonic development in kurosoi, Sebastes schlegeli Hilgendorf, were analyzed to determine the patterns ofembryonic nutrition. The egg of this species is larger and contains over three times the energy content of that in S. melanops, another species which has been studied. Catabolism during the 51 days of embryonic development required 88 % of the original energy in the egg, but the embryo at birth contained 93 % of the initial egg energy. Thus the total energy required for development from fertilization to birth requires z 1. 8 times the initial, endogenous energy supply. Histologi-cal studies demonstrate that uptake occurs through ingestion and absorption of ovarian fluid in the hindgut. Protein and nitrogen budgets during development suggest that the primary substance taken up is nitro-genous. No distinct structures are apparent in the ovarian system to supply nutrients to the developing embryos. Analysis of fecundity-at-length, however, shows that post-fertilization fecundity estimates are significantly lower than pre-fertilization values; the reduction apparently occurs through resorption of <b>ova</b> or early <b>embryos.</b> Along with catabolism, this results in an overall decrease in the energy content of the ovarie...|$|R
60|$|An {{excess of}} either sex, we will again say of the males, could, however, {{apparently}} be eliminated through natural selection in another and indirect manner, namely by an actual diminution of the males, without any {{increase of the}} females, and consequently without any increase in the productiveness of the species. From the variability of all characters, we may feel assured that some pairs, inhabiting any locality, would produce a rather smaller excess of superfluous males, but {{an equal number of}} productive females. When the offspring from the more and the less male-productive parents were all mingled together, none would have any direct advantage over the others; but those that produced few superfluous males would have one great indirect advantage, namely that their <b>ova</b> or <b>embryos</b> would probably be larger and finer, or their young better nurtured in the womb and afterwards. We see this principle illustrated with plants; as those which bear a vast number of seed produce small ones; whilst those which bear comparatively few seeds, often produce large ones well-stocked with nutriment {{for the use of the}} seedlings.[408] Hence the offspring of the parents which had wasted least force in producing superfluous males would be the most likely to survive, and would inherit the same tendency not to produce superfluous males, whilst retaining their full fertility in the production of females. So it would be with the converse case of the female sex. Any slight excess, however, of either sex could hardly be checked in so indirect a manner. Nor indeed has a considerable inequality between the sexes been always prevented, as we have seen in some of the cases given in the previous discussion. In these cases the unknown causes which determine the sex of the embryo, and which under certain conditions lead to the production of one sex in excess over the other, have not been mastered by the survival of those varieties which were subjected to the least waste of organised matter and force by the production of superfluous individuals of either sex. Nevertheless we may conclude that natural selection will always tend, though sometimes inefficiently, to equalise the relative numbers of the two sexes.|$|R
