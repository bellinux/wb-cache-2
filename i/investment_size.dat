25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1921, a general {{change-over}} from revkoms and kombeds to Soviets took place. In order to help the Azerbaijani oil industry the Supreme Council of the National Economy decided {{in the same year}} to provide it with everything necessary out of turn. The new oilfields, like Ilyich Bay, Qara-Chukhur, Lok-Batan and Kala have been discovered. In 1929 a great kolkhoz movement had developed and Azerbaijan became the second Soviet tea producer after the Georgian SSR for the first time. On 31 March 1931 the oil industry of the Azerbaijan SSR, which supplied over 60% of the total Soviet oil production at the time, was awarded the Order of Lenin. The republic gained the second Order on 15 March 1935 during the observation of its 15th anniversary. At {{the end of the second}} five-year plan (1933–1937) Azerbaijan appeared at 3rd place in the Soviet Union by its capital <b>investment</b> <b>size.</b> In 1938, the Azerbaijani alphabet was changed from Latin to Cyrillic alphabet.|$|E

Instead, they run quarterly events (called Build events) where all HackFwd members come together for feedback and expert mentorship sessions, which were designed to offer the most relevant support to startups in different phases of the program. Some of the material from the Build events were made public on the Where Passion Meets Momentum video website.|$|R
40|$|Storage {{devices and}} demand control may {{constitute}} beneficial tools to optimize electricity generation {{with a large}} share of intermittent resources through inter-temporal substitution of load. We quantify the related cost reductions in a simulation model of a simplified stylized medium-voltage grid (10 kV) under uncertain demand and wind output. Benders Decomposition Method is applied to create a two-stage stochastic program. The model informs an optimal <b>investment</b> <b>sizing</b> decision as regards specific 'smart grid' applications such as storage facilities and meters enabling load control. Model results indicate that central storage facilities are a more promising option for generation cost reductions as compared to demand management. Grid extensions are not appropriate in any of our scenarios. A sensitivity analysis is applied with respect to the market penetration of uncoordinated Plug-In Electric Vehicles which are found to strongly encourage investment into load control equipment for `smart` charging and slightly improve the case for central storage devices.

50|$|Opponents of {{this issue}} argue easier access to capital through {{a large number of}} smaller investors can hurt the project and its creators. With a {{simplified}} capital-raising process involving more investors with smaller stakes, investors are more risk-seeking because they can take on an <b>investment</b> <b>size</b> with which they are comfortable. This leads to entrepreneurs losing possible experience convincing investors who are wary of potential risks in investing because they do not depend on one single investor for the survival of their project. Instead of being forced to assess risks and convince large institutional investors why their project can be successful, wary investors can be replaced by others who are willing to take on the risk.|$|E

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of heterosexual dating relationships tested investment model predictions regarding {{the process by which}} satisfaction and commitment develop (or deteriorate) over time.

The management {{of the companies that}} constitute this industry is therefore a subject which should be of considerable interest to the three million people who are shareholders in these companies. This subject is investigated by concentrating on four primary areas of interest: (1) management and supervision of the investment company portfolio by the investment company adviser, (2) the relationship of <b>investment</b> company <b>size</b> to the management fee paid the investment adviser, (3) the relationship of <b>investment</b> company <b>size</b> to the operating expenses of the company (exclusive of management fees) and, (4) the relationship of investment company performance to the management fee paid the investment adviser.
