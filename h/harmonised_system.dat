ATC systems have traditionally been developed by individual States that concentrated on their own requirements, creating different levels of service and capability around the world. Many Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) do not provide an ATC service that matches the capabilities of modern aircraft, so ICAO has developed the Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBU) initiative in order to harmonise global planning of technology upgrades.|$|R

The envisaged monetary union in the SADC is premised on a number of economic and financial regulations aimed at stimulating efforts by member states to achieve deeper forms of regional integration. The latter imperatives include a <b>harmonised</b> payment <b>system</b> as well as a corporate governance system among others. Nonetheless it is surprising how the pace of the process has been very subpar taking into consideration that it is the year 2015 and there has been no clear carved out legislation in any form which deals with the aspect of corporate governance raises concerns. This study serves as not only a reminder but also gives guidelines to taking progressive steps towards <b>harmonised</b> <b>systems</b> of law to ensure the efficient running of companies in SADC. This study is predicated upon other successful systems and the lessons that SADC could make use of as examples in creating a robust system of laws to ensure good corporate governance and in the long run the fulfilment of the concept of a monetary union...|$|R

40|$|Policy convergence, {{defined as}} the growth in {{similarity}} of policies over time, constitutes a central concept in comparative public policy, yet {{a great deal of}} ambiguity and contention surrounds it. The article discusses the conceptual and practical meanings of policy convergence in the context of efforts to <b>harmonise</b> biosafety <b>systems</b> across various regions of Africa. The article comes from a broader investigation {{of the ways in which}} three supranational organisations, the African Union (AU), New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are influencing processes towards the <b>harmonised</b> biosafety <b>systems</b> in southern Africa. Unearthing different stakeholders understandings of what convergence or harmonisation are, and how they can be achieved, the article argues that an illumination of the different framings of these concepts is crucial, not for the sake of eliminating differences between these understandings, but in order to illustrate the divergent realities and their potential to facilitate or inhibit policy making processes...|$|R

40|$|An {{international}} {{study has}} been carried out to extend the scope of the World Bank HDM-III model, and to provide a <b>harmonised</b> <b>systems</b> approach to road management, with adaptable and user-friendly software tools. This has resulted {{in the development of a}} new set of Highway Development and Management Tools collectively referred to as HDM- 4. The scope of the new HDM- 4 tools have been broadened considerably beyond traditional project appraisals, to provide a powerful system for the analysis of road management and investment alternatives. The paper describes the HDM- 4 software applications developed to cater for the following components within the highway management process: Strategic Planning, Work Programming, and Project Preparation. Strategic planning involves the analysis of the road system as a whole, typically requiring the preparation of long term, or strategic, planning estimates of expenditure for road development and preservation under various budgetary and economic scenarios. Work Programming involves the preparation, under budget constraints, of multi-year road work and expenditure programmes in which sections of the network likely to require improvement, are identified and prioritised. Project preparation is the final stage where the economic benefits of road schemes are analysed prior to implementation. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEFSA and EMA have jointly {{reviewed}} {{measures taken}} in the EU to {{reduce the need for}} and use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals, and the resultant impacts on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Reduction strategies have been implemented successfully in some Member States. Such strategies include national reduction targets, benchmarking of antimicrobial use, controls on prescribing and restrictions on use of specific critically important antimicrobials, together with improvements to animal husbandry and disease prevention and control measures. Due to the multiplicity of factors contributing to AMR, the impact of any single measure is difficult to quantify, although there is evidence of an association between reduction in antimicrobial use and reduced AMR. To minimise antimicrobial use, a multifaceted integrated approach should be implemented, adapted to local circumstances. Recommended options (non-prioritised) include: development of national strategies; <b>harmonised</b> <b>systems</b> for monitoring antimicrobial use and AMR development; establishing national targets for antimicrobial use reduction; use of on-farm health plans; increasing the responsibility of veterinarians for antimicrobial prescribing; training, education and raising public awareness; increasing the availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics; improving husbandry and management procedures for disease prevention and control; rethinking livestock production systems to reduce inherent disease risk. A limited number of studies provide robust evidence of alternatives to antimicrobials that positively influence health parameters. Possible alternatives include probiotics and prebiotics, competitive exclusion, bacteriophages, immunomodulators, organic acids and teat sealants. Development of a legislative framework that permits the use of specific products as alternatives should be considered. Further research to evaluate the potential of alternative farming systems on reducing AMR is also recommended. Animals suffering from bacterial infections should only be treated with antimicrobials based on veterinary diagnosis and prescription. Options should be reviewed to phas...|$|R
