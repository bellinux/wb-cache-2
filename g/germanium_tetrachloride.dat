40|$|As part of {{the general}} study of {{icosahedral}} carborane chemistry a comprehensive literature survey is presented with references. Investigations of the preparative routes to ortho-carborane, 1 -methyl-o-carborane and some carborane polymers showed that improvements on existing literature methods could be made. In the synthesis of possible carborane-polymer precursors, several coupled carborane systems were investigated. These included C-C',B-B' direct cage coupling reactions and coupling via short alkyl chains. Reactions of MeƟLi (Ɵ= -CB(_ 10) HC-) with boron chlorides produced the previously unreported boron coupled carboranes (MeƟ) (_ 2) BR, (R=C 1,OH, Ph) and MeƟBPh(_ 2). Three carborane cages could not be bonded to a singleboron atom. The previously unreported di-(3, 3 '-o-carboranyl) -N,N-r 12 -piperazine was prepared from the [HƟH](^ 2 -) anion.

40|$|Replacing {{molecular}} chlorine and hydrochloric acid with less energy- and risk-intensive reagents would dramatically improve {{the environmental impact}} of metal manufacturing at a time when demand for metals is rapidly increasing. Germanium and tin are classified as “critical” elements based on growing demand for these elements in technological applications, lack of suitable substitutes, and, for germanium, high dispersion in the environment making extraction of the element process-intensive. This thesis describes a recyclable quinone / catechol redox platform that provides an innovative replacement for elemental chlorine and hydrochloric acid in the conversion of germanium metal or tin metal to element tetrachloride substitutes. The approach described in this thesis replaces the oxidizing capacity of chlorine with molecular oxygen, and replaces <b>germanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> and tin tetrachloride with air- and moisture-stable germanium or tin catecholate complexes that are kinetically competent for conversion to high-purity organogermanes and organostannanes.
