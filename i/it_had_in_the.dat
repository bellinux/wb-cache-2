5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In {{only three}} plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan Taylor {{was followed by}} one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard throw to Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown of the quarter. The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– {{more than in the}} First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, {{when the national}} emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme {{for the remainder of}} its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> week directly previous, {{where it had been}} beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E

5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi has no more incentive to discuss its operations today than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s or 1970s. Although the U.S. has been more open about its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} conceived in 1999 as Resident Evil 4. Due {{to the staff}} feeling it would not fit the Resident Evil franchise, the project dropped its ties to Resident Evil and was made into its own story instead. Devil May Cry received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> action game genre, its high difficulty and the high overall scores which many professional reviewers concluded {{to be one of}} the best and most innovative video games of all time. The game has sold more than three million copies, and spawned multiple Capcom-developed sequels and prequels.|$|E

5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the {{military}} dictatorship, Alfonsín pursued cultural and educational policies aimed at reducing the authoritarian customs of several institutions and groups. He also promoted freedom of the press. Several intellectuals and scientists who had left the country in the previous decade returned, which benefited the universities. The University of Buenos Aires returned to the quality levels that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. Many intellectuals became involved in politics as well, providing a cultural perspective to the political discourse. Both Alfonsín and the Peronist Antonio Cafiero benefited.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Texas Tech was {{admitted}} to the Southwest Conference (SWC), in which it experienced similar success as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Border Conference. In the regular season, the Red Raiders won four conference championships and three conference co-championships. At the end of the 1976 regular season, the SWC began an annual conference tournament known as the SWC Classic. Texas Tech won five SWC Classic titles in their six appearances in the conference tournament championship game; three under Gerald Myers and two under James Dickey. The university remained in the SWC until the conference ceased operations in 1996, when Dickey's 1995–96 team ended the season ranked eighth in both the Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll and won the conference's final regular season and SWC Classic titles. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the university became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. Since joining the Big 12 Conference, the Red Raiders did not receive a bid to postseason play until 2002, when Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight was hired. During Knight's six-year tenure, Texas Tech received five postseason bids, participating in four NCAA tournaments and one National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The Red Raiders won the third place playoff in the 2003 NIT Tournament, the farthest a Red Raiders men's basketball team has advanced in postseason play. During the 2007–08 season, Bob Knight resigned as head coach and his son, then assistant head coach, Pat Knight became Texas Tech's 13th head coach. In the 2009-10 season, Pat Knight led the Red Raiders to the (NIT) where they were defeated in the quarterfinals. After failing to make the NCAA tournament, and compiling a 16-42 Big 12 Conference record over his three and a half seasons as head coach, Texas Tech terminated Pat Knight's position has head coach. On March 20, 2011, Texas Tech hired Billy Clyde Gillispie, former head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats, Texas A Aggies, and UTEP Miners, as the 14th head coach of the Texas Tech men's basketball program.|$|E
