500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> trouble yourself), is a chorale fantasia, {{with the}} vocal part {{embedded}} {{in an independent}} concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus on the melody of [...] "" [...] is in long notes, partly embellished, in the soprano and horn; the lower voices are mostly set in homophony. The lines of the chorale are not rendered separately, but accenting the bar form (Stollen–Stollen–Abgesang) of the text, 1 and 2 are combined, 3 and 4 are combined, 5 is single and 6 to 8 are combined. The scoring is relatively rich in woodwinds.|$|E
500|$|Since 533, the new {{pope has}} also decided on his regnal name. Pope John II {{was the first}} to adopt a new papal name; he felt that his {{original}} name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a Roman god. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: [...] "Quo nomine vis vocari? (By what name <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be called?)" [...] After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.|$|E

Everyone present at the meeting advised Sun Quan to surrender and welcome Cao Cao; only Lu Su remained silent. When Sun Quan left the meeting for a change of clothes, Lu Su hurriedly left his seat and followed his lord. Sun Quan understood Lu Su's intention, so he held Lu Su's hand and asked, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> tell me?"

This is a sign that Heaven has granted you to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Ratu Kamisese Mara, {{and other organizations}} opposed to the Federation Party, {{he was involved in}} the formation of Fiji's first multi-racial political party, the Alliance Party. He joined the Alliance Party independently of Ayodhya Prasad's National Congress of Fiji and worked himself to a position of influence within the Party by taking up the posts of Treasurer and Publicity Manager. When the Congress was wound up in 1967, its members joined the Indian division of the Alliance Party, the Indian Alliance, with Vijay R. Singh as President. In the 1966 election, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Council from the East-Central cross-voting seat which covered Vanua Levu and Lau. The Federation Party had no hope of winning the seat and to confuse voters selected another Vijay Singh. From then on he started to use the name, Vijay R. Singh (Vijay Raghubar Singh - using his father's first name as his middle name.) The ploy by the Federation Party backfired, as Vijay R. Singh's opponent was a clerk and he asked the electorate, [...] "Which Vijay Singh <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> vote for - the clerk or the lawyer?" ...|$|E
