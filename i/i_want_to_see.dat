25|$|The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> the Bright Lights Tonight, was {{recorded}} in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain {{and its impact on}} the availability of vinyl for records, Bright Lights was held back by Island Records for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by the critics, though sales were less than stellar.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{apparent}} from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974. <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> the Bright Lights Tonight was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs {{for the second}} Richard and Linda album, Hokey Pokey, were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release. It was Pour Down Like Silver, with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson gazing out at the world, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons' growing preoccupation with their faith.|$|E

However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's for you and me living out our dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> is a sky full of lighters". Afterwards, the bass drops along with synth chords and Eminem starts to rap with his [...] "crescendos build up to fist-pumping levels", [...] being followed by Royce.|$|E

In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to [...]316.

500|$|He {{also used}} [...] "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" [...] by novelty singer Corn Mo at {{the insistence of}} Nick Offerman, who plays three minor roles in the film. The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward's [...] "One Life Away" [...] as an [...] "old-timey instrumental" [...] for one of Mercer's dreams, an homage to a dancing {{sequence}} seen in Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film Bande à part. For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of [...] "When I Get to the Border" [...] from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> the Bright Lights Tonight. The pair found themselves [...] "mutually charmed", according to The New York Times Melena Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you in it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the show {{received}} the most disparate reviews from critics. Kubicek {{was one of the}} most enthusiastic about [...] "Summer Nights", and wrote, [...] "This is the kind of ridiculous, over-the-top, hilariously cheesy stuff <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> from Glee all the time." [...] He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines, and Sugar was [...] "being embraced as a part of the group". Lynch thought that [...] "Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully", and gave this [...] "easily the most fun {{number of the}} episode" [...] an [...] "A−". Stanhope said that [...] "the energy is infectious and you can feel the sparks between the former pair", but the performance was [...] "way too much of a copycat" [...] of the original Grease scene, while Flandez said that the two leads [...] "lacked chemistry" [...] and that the number was [...] "inexplicable". VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed: [...] "dumb and unnecessary". Chaney wrote that the number [...] "was a high-energy, cute way for the show to mark its comeback", but said that Rory [...] "sounded flat" [...] on one of his lines, and Sam [...] "couldn’t quite hit" [...] the ending high note in the song, and graded it a [...] "B".|$|E

500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|The Infected, a core {{concept of}} the game, were {{inspired}} by {{a segment of the}} BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the {{concept of the}} fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. [...] "I've seen enough good stories in books and film. Now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them in video games," [...] said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.|$|E
500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} make some changes and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm going to make some {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E
