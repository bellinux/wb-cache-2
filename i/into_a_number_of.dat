50|$|For example, the {{coefficient}} of x5 is +1 because {{there are two ways}} to split 5 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct parts (4+1 and 3+2), but only one way to do so for <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct parts (the one-part partition 5). However, {{the coefficient}} of x12 is −1 because there are seven ways to partition 12 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct parts, but there are eight ways to partition 12 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct parts.|$|R

5000|$|Statistical data binning {{is a way}} {{to group}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> more or less {{continuous}} values <b>into</b> <b>a</b> smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> [...] "bins".

The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E

5|$|The empire's {{population}} was classified into white people, {{also referred to}} as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to as persons of colour, negros and natives.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the situation in Albania became unstable, and political chaos emerged as the country was split <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> regional governments. As {{a consequence of the}} anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification, and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country.

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific.

The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder.
