40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} using an anaerobic bioreactor system for the color removal and reuse of spent reactive <b>dyebaths</b> The objective of this project is to biologically renovate reactive <b>dyebaths</b> and reuse the high-salt containing mixture in the dyeing process.

This approach will accomplish two goals: (a) destruction of the dye azo bond and therefore elimination of the color from the plant effluent; and (b) reuse of the renovated process water and salts which in turn will lead to wastewater volume reduction and water as well as salt conservation. The results of the proposed study will demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of anaerobic biological processes as a low-cost decolorization and reuse technology for spent reactive <b>dyebaths.</b> Nine commercial reactive dyes have been chosen and represent the range of chemical structures in reactive dyes.

Textile wet processes, {{particularly}} batch dyeing and finishing, consume {{vast quantities}} of water, posing significant demands on the water resources in regions where the industry is concentrated. Some <b>dyebaths</b> offer the potential for reuse, if appropriate adjustments are made for the residual dyes and their effect on product shades. If manufacturers successfully implement reuse, both the textile firm and the community will draw substantial benefits, including reduced consumption of water, energy, and chemicals and reduced wastewater effluent to be treated. Current efforts at Georgia Tech involve development and demonstration of an automated system to analyze the spent <b>dyebaths</b> in a nylon carpet manufacturing process, permitting their reconstitution and reuse without additional labor or expertise. Process water requirements may be reduced by about 7, 300 gallons per batch (> 55 % savings) while reuse of chemicals and energy is estimated to provide a substantial savings of – 4. 3 ¢ per pound of carpet.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{stability}} (in terms of half-life time) and decolourisation efficiency of free and immobilised laccase was determined in four industrial dyeing effluents. The dyeing liquors composition and the chemical {{structure of the}} dyes influence significantly the stability and the decolourisation ability of the enzyme. The dyeing in enzymatically decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent provided consistency of the colour with both bright and dark dyes. Additionally the number of washing cycles necessary to remove the hydrolyzed dyestuff from dyed textiles was reduced using an enzymatic pre-treatment. In decolourisation experiments with immobilised laccase, two phenomenons were observed - initial decolourisation due to adsorption on the support and dye degradation due to the enzyme action. This research focuses on the stability and decolourisation ability of free and immobilised laccase in industrial dyeing effluents and their reuse for dyeing. In our experiments {{the stability of the}} immobilised laccase in dyeing liquors was unexpectedly lower than the stability of the free enzyme. The stability of the laccase in dyeing effluents {{is a result of the}} additive effect of all components presented. The decrease of enzymatic activity could be associated with the potential protein – dyeing effluent components interactions. Azoaromatic sulfonate dye anions could provide enzyme stabilisation. However, the structure of the immobilised laccase possibly became less accessible than the free enzyme for interaction with the anionic dyes, and thereby the stabilisation was not efficient. Non-ionic surfactants present in the dyeing liquors are able to stabilise the enzyme in solution by formation of a surrounding shell. The surfactant stabilisation was effective only on free enzyme. The salts in the <b>dyebaths</b> also displayed enzyme stabilising properties. The presence of CrVI and CrIII in the mordant dyeing effluent could cause significant loss of activity. The colour removal with immobilized laccase is due to the additive effects of dye-support adsorption, dye-protein adsorption and enzymatic dye degradation. In the decolourisation experiments carried out in pure dyes, the higher the hydrophilicity of the dye, the lower was the decolourisation. The Reactive Blue 158 adsorbed on the alumina support could act as mediator in laccase-assisted reactions, explaining the higher decolourisation of Reactive Black 5 with immobilized enzyme. The decolourisation efficiency in dyeing effluents was affected by the stabilization/destabilisation interactions in the dyeing formulation. Acceptable colour difference was achieved in dyeing with <b>dyebaths</b> prepared with laccase decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent.

40|$|A {{review of}} the main natural dyes (particularly yellow {{flavonoids}} and red anthraquinones) and proteinaceous substrates used in Historical Tapestries and North American porcupine quill work was undertaken, and is summarised in Chapter 1. The analysis of natural dyes which have been used on museum artefacts other than textiles has received little systematic study, particularly those of non-European origin. In this research, the use of Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) for study of natural dyes found on historical textiles and ethnographical objects decorated with porcupine quill work is explored; this required a transfer of existing analytical protocols and methodology. The advantages of using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) was evaluated through a method development based on the separation and quantification of ten flavonoid and anthraquinone dyes as described in Chapter 2. These methods were then applied to the characterisation of the dye sources found {{on a group of}} sixteenth century historical tapestries which form {{an important part of the}} Burrell Collection in Glasgow and are believed to have been manufactured in an English workshop (Chapter 3) and also to the analysis of some late nineteenth century North American porcupine quill work from a collection owned by National Museums Scotland (Chapter 5); allowing exciting conclusions to be drawn in each case about the range of dyestuffs used in their manufacture. The second aim of this research was the development of methodology for the non-invasive quantification of metal ion residues on porcupine quill substrates. This was achieved through a comparative study of reference porcupine quills prepared in-house with <b>dyebaths</b> containing a range of metal ion concentrations (copper and tin). The concentration of metal ions sorbed by the porcupine quills was then quantified with Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) coupled to Optical Emission Spectrometry (OES) and non-invasive Particle Induced X-Ray Emission analysis (PIXE) coupled with Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) as described in Chapter 4. The responses provided by the different methods were compared and they were then applied to the study of micro-samples collected from mid-nineteenth century Northern Athapaskan porcupine quill work. Unexpectedly, the use of UPLC analysis and RBS-PIXE analysis allowed the characterisation of traded European natural dyes used with metallic mordants (copper and tin) on these samples, highlighting how European contact impacted on traditional Athapaskan porcupine quill work in the late nineteenth century (Chapter 5) ...|$|R
