5|$|As a freshman, Cabral was {{the second}} slowest runner on the soccer team. He tried out for track {{to work on his}} speed. At first he ran the 400 meters in 68 seconds. By the end of the spring, he broke 10 minutes in the 2 mile and was {{considering}} joining the cross country team instead of participating <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> fall sport, soccer. In the summer of 2005, the cross country coach sent him a letter of encouragement.|$|E
5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} two long lasting {{newspaper}} comic strips, Vandersteen {{made a number of}} other comics in these years. Most important was his work for Ons Volkske, the youth supplement of the weekly magazine Ons Volk, which from the end of 1945 on became an independent comic magazine. Marc Sleen was editor-in-chief and filled most pages together with Vandersteen. Vandersteen created a number of realistic stories of about 20 pages each, where he developed his own style after starting very much as a follower of Harold Foster. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> more caricatural style, he created in August 1946 the recurring gagstrip De Vrolijke Bengels (The Happy Rascals). More adult comics appeared in the magazine Ons Volk.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Laird {{scored in}} Stevenage's {{pre-season}} friendly victory over Histon. He {{started in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. In September 2010, in games against Cheltenham Town and Torquay United respectively, Laird {{was used as a}} left midfielder, as opposed to playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> left-back position. He reverted to the left-back spot in Stevenage's 1–0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty spot, in a 2–1 win over Burton Albion in October 2010. A week later, he missed the chance to double his goal tally for the season, missing a second-half penalty in a 0–0 draw against Morecambe. Coincidentally, Laird's second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Morecambe in January 2011; he scored from close range following John Mousinho's cross to give Stevenage the lead. Just three days later, Laird scored his third goal of the season, netting with a curling effort from 25 yards out to give Stevenage their third goal of a 3–0 win against Rotherham United. Laird was initially credited with scoring an 87th-minute winner in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Crewe Alexandra on 19 February 2011, but the goal was eventually given to teammate Byron Harrison. At the age of 22, Laird captained Stevenage {{for the first time in}} their 1–0 loss to Hereford United on 8 March 2011. In the club's following match, against Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Laird was sent-off for two bookable offences, although Stevenage held on to win the match 1–0. Laird's fourth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's 3–3 draw against Bury on 7 May 2011, as he opened the scoring with a strike from 25 yards out. He played a total of 54 games during the 2010–11 season, scoring four goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Laird playing the whole game.|$|E
5|$|With Zolak {{coming to}} {{the final year of}} his {{contract}} in 1998, he sat <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during {{the first three months of}} the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33yards and an interception in a 4110 loss. Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game. Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995. Zolak's first start came against the San Francisco 49ers on December 20. He completed 14 of 30 passes for 205yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and won the game, 2421. He faced the New York Jets the following week, completing 14 of 31 passes for 127yards and a touchdown, but lost the game 3110. Zolak finished the season with his most productive totals since 1992. He played in six games and started two, completed 32 of 75 passes for 371yards, three touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 61.8. Zolak's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs, as Bledsoe was still injured, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 2510 loss. He became an unrestricted free agent after the season ended, but was not asked back by the Patriots, ending his tenure there.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1842, the {{landscape}} architect Peter Joseph Lenné designed the church grounds, the cove, the Sacrow Manor's park, and a rented {{house in the}} Italian style (1843/44) by Persius called Zum Doctor Faustus, which stood farther to the east. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> fashion, Lenné designed wide walking paths and a wide view of the Parks of Glienicke and Babelsberg, of the New Garden, Potsdam, and of the City of Potsdam itself.

25|$|His final {{series for}} New Zealand was a {{personal}} anti-climax for this immensely popular cricketer. The historic 1985/86 test series win in Australia saw Cairns play only in the deciding third test in Perth. Although playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> spirited fashion, Cairns failed to take a wicket, nor score a run, in this his final international game. Despite Cairns' disappointment, New Zealand won by six wickets to take the series 2-1, and it was fitting, considering his unselfish service to New Zealand cricket since 1974, that Cairns was part of this 'ultimate' triumph.|$|E

25|$|In February and March 1981, Channel 7 aired {{a program}} called Gunston's Australia, which {{intended}} to show the Gunston character approaching {{the end of his}} shelf life. In a satirical reference to personalities like former ABC current affairs host Bill Peach, the series parodied the perennial Australian TV practice of hiring celebrities to host magazine-style programs after leaving the show that had brought them to fame. Wearing a safari jacket and shorts, Gunston travelled around outback Australia, interfering and adventuring in high and low places <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> cack-handed manner. This series was later screened from February to March 1983 on UK Channel 4 TV.|$|E
25|$|BBC Radio 1's chart {{show had}} aired the UK Singles Chart {{exclusively}} on Sunday afternoons since the programme began; {{but this was}} moved to Fridays in July 2015.

For many years, the show prided itself on playing all 40 singles in the top 40 but this practice ended when Wes Butters took over as presenter in 2003; then only tracks below number 20 to be played were the new entries. The show took its current format on 10 July 2015, being presented by Greg James <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> drive time slot.

25|$|Halladay was the American League {{pitcher of}} the month in April 2007, going 4–0, {{highlighted}} by a 10-inning complete game win over the Detroit Tigers. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 {{was placed on the}} disabled list and underwent an appendectomy. He returned to the rotation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> form on May 31 against the Chicago White Sox. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed John McDonald to score. He shut out the Seattle Mariners on July 22, allowing only three hits.|$|E
25|$|Intimidatory or {{aggressive}} bowling {{is a legitimate}} tactic of bowling {{with the intent of}} hitting the batsman with the ball. This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those that disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the beamer, which is aimed directly at the head on the full. Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage. The intention is to disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce a mistake that leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket. Often the eventual wicket will not fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> way (by fear, pain, surprise, or some combination of the three).|$|E
25|$|Caylà himself {{initially}} stayed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>usual</b> hotel residence, but {{following the}} news of Cunill and other Requeté leaders having been captured he realized the danger and after few days went into hiding by his relatives in Barcelona. He refused to flee the Republican zone, since he considered it a treason to Traditionalist cause. Confronted with a tragic choice between two bad options he preferred to face whatever the future brings. In early August the Valls committee of Milícies Antifeixistes launched their search of the Carlist leader. Having intercepted Caylà’s correspondence they learnt his whereabouts and a dedicated militia detachment was sent to Barcelona on a capture mission. In mid-August Caylà was arrested in his hideout, driven by car to Valls and executed on Plaça del Pati immediately after arrival. According to some accounts, the Republicans staged sort of a feast afterwards with locals forced to pass by his corpse; according to the other, militiamen used his cut off head as a football.|$|E
