30|$|From the aphids {{selected}} for study, colour from the <b>ivy</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis hederae) made with wine using similar processes from the fifteenth-century recipe § 8 without adding any calcium carbonate, has remained fairly stable after 4  years {{kept in a}} dark envelope (Fig.  8 —no. 2). Therefore, using the <b>ivy</b> <b>aphid</b> reconstruction as a basis to work from, {{the stability of the}} colour could be developed further using variant recipe combinations with other ingredients. Even with the more fugitive colour from the giant willow aphid, with further research and investigation its durability may be improved by adjusting the processing method and additives.|$|E
30|$|The {{chromophore}} group {{contained in}} aphids is naphthoquinone, {{with the most}} important element being perylene quinone obtained from the protoaphin-sl compound (C 36 H 38 O 16). This is present when the giant willow aphid (Tuberolachnus salignus) is crushed under neutral conditions [5]. The wormwood aphid (Macrosiphoniella absinthii) contains the acetylfluoraphin compound (C 23 H 24 O 11) and the 2 -hydroxyemodin compound (C 15 H 10 O 6) is found in the <b>ivy</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis hederae) [6].|$|E
30|$|The <b>ivy</b> <b>aphid</b> {{was first}} {{observed}} and accidentally {{crushed by the}} author, when large aphid colonies were hosting on the ivy plant that the author was using to explore processes to extract ivy gum using the LDA recipe § 1.9. 3 A (see below and Fig.  2 b). The visible red colour associated with the crushed insect {{raised the question of}} whether these insects would ever have been processed or used as a pigment in past practices and led to the idea of exploring whether a colourant can be made using locally sourced insects.|$|E
30|$|Chemist Christoph Krekel has {{successfully}} reconstructed the rare ivy gum colourant following selected medieval recipes translated by Mrs Merrified, Richards Thompson and the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Sedelius [19]. His practical outcomes {{differ from the}} experiments outlined in this study because his research was to reconstruct a ‘blood–red’ colourant using selected medieval recipes, rather than producing flesh tone paint made using <b>ivy</b> gum and <b>aphids.</b>|$|R
30|$|Even {{though there}} has been no {{historical}} evidence found to suggest that aphids were used for colourants in past practice on manuscripts or other objects, this work explores the <b>ivy</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis hederae); the wormwood aphid (Macrosiphoniella absinthii) and the giant willow aphid (Tuberolachnus salignus) and processed into paint sources {{as an alternative to the}} more commonly known scale insects that are evidently recorded in historical recipes. Well known scale insects included the kermes insect (Kermes vermilio) which contains the colouring agent kermesic acid (C 16 H 10 O 8), the cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus) containing carminic acid (C 22 H 20 O 13) and the secretion from the lac insect (Kerria lacca, Laccifer lacca, Carteria lacca, Tachardia lacca, Lakshadia lacca, and the Chinese lac: Kerria chinensis) containing laccaic acid (C 26 H 19 NO 12) which belongs to the chromophore group anthraquinone [7, 8]. For this work, experience with producing colourants from these better known dye sources was essential for experiments to produce the aphid-based colours.|$|E
