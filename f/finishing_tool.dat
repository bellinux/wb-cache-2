50|$|After its {{acquisition}} by Avid, DS {{was always}} positioned {{as a high}} end video <b>finishing</b> <b>tool.</b> However, many users {{found it to be}} uniquely soup-to-nuts in its capabilities. From version 1.0 of the product, it competed with products like Autodesk Smoke, Quantel and Avid Symphony. The toolset in DS offered video timeline editing, an object-oriented vector-based paint tool, 2D layer compositing, sample based audio and starting with version 3.01 of the product, a 3D environment. Originally, a subset of the SoftimageXSI 3D software was planned {{to become part of the}} DS toolset, both were built on the same software foundation, but over time the code bases divided between the applications and the integration never happened.|$|E

Lastly the integration of the toolset of Softimage DS was beyond what other product offered.

The experiments were performed on ferromagnetic workpiece surface in the developed MR finishing setup to study the effect of finishing time on final surface roughness. The performance of present finishing process on final finished surface roughness was studied. The surface morphology was observed under scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope. The final surface finish was obtained as low as 19. 7 nm from the initial surface roughness of 142. 9 nm.

40|$|Since screw {{compressor}} rotors {{are of a}} helical shape and tool points engaged in their manufacturing pass different cutting length, the tools do not wear uniformly along the rotor profiles. The non-uniformity depends on {{a difference between the}} rotor point angle and pressure angle and on the rotor helix angle. A difference in relative movement between the tool and the rotors with and without the cutting stock is used to quantify a relative wear of the tool. This is now in counterpart used as a basis for calculation of a variable rotor stock distribution, which results in a uniform wear of the <b>finishing</b> <b>tool</b> when it is applied. Finally, the roughing or semi-finishing tool is generated which cuts the rotors with such a variable distributed stock.

The surface after traditional machining is discussed as well as {{a method for}} finishing the hole-wall surface using a design of finish-tool that includes a nonconductive knothole-form burnishing-tool and a ring electrode to execute simultaneous burnishing and electrofinishing (SBEF). By the dual and synchronous effect of the electrode and the burnishing-tool a superior hole-wall finish is achieved. In the experiment, the use of a small arc rounding radius and a thin finish-tool is advantageous to the finishing effect. A high rotational speed of the finish-tool produces a better finish.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} hardened tool steel milling studies. High speed milling is largely utilized to substitute some EDM and polishing operations, mainly in hardened tool steel <b>finishing.</b> <b>Tool</b> path strategy may either enable good surface finish or contributes to generate high roughness values and poor surface finish. Tool inclination (angle between tool axis and workpiece surface) influences the system response to vibration. In this work, several milling experiments were performed in a circular convex AISI D 6 hardened steel workpiece, having as input variables feed direction (upward and downward the circle) and tilt angle (tool inclination). The main results indicate that upward tool path presented mostly high roughness values which were also influenced by tool inclination. Downward tool path presented low roughness values and was less influenced by tool inclination. Upward tool path and positive tool inclination should be avoided because they presented roughness values incompatible to EDM process substitution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for generating curvature-adaptive <b>finishing</b> <b>tool</b> paths with bounded error directly from massive point data in three-axis {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) milling. This approach uses the moving least-squares (MLS) surface as the underlying surface representation. A closed-form formula for normal curvature computation {{is derived from the}} implicit form of MLS surfaces. It enables the generation of curvature-adaptive tool paths from massive point data that is critical for balancing the trade-off between machining accuracy and speed. To ensure the path accuracy and robustness for arbitrary surfaces where there might be an abrupt curvature change, a novel guidance field algorithm is introduced. It overcomes potential excessive locality of curvature-adaptive paths by examining the neighboring points ’ curvature within a selfupdating search bound. Our results affirm that the combination of curvature-adaptive path generation and the guidance field algorithm produces high-quality numerical control (NC) paths from a variety of point cloud data with bounded error. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3010710...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the decoration of}} Greek bookbinding, through {{the study of the}} leather-covered bindings from the monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai, Egypt. The manuscript collection is remarkable for the variety of binding styles that represent mainly Greek but also other bookbinding traditions, including Georgian. Syrian and Eastern European. The examination of the decorative motifs tooled on the leather covered bindings aims to identify the style and characteristics of bookbinding at the monastery. Moreover, links between and evidence for specific bindings and the manuscripts they contain are established by grouping them and relating them to specific binders and bookbinding workshops. The workshops of the monastery are examined in parallel with groups of bindings that were imported into the monastery. The extent to which the trade in books and the circulation of binding techniques between the monastery and the west was a reflection of the relations of the monastery with its dependencies is also explored. Rubbings of the approximately 5500 tool impressions on the 1195 decorated bindings have provided the core research material. They have been identified, classified and organized into a descriptive electronic database. Imaging techniques have been developed to compare the scanned impressions, which permitted the identification of impressions of the same <b>finishing</b> <b>tools.</b> Based on the identity of their decorative tools and on the process of comparison of their structural features, a number of the bindings have been ascribed to a total of 70 specific workshops, whose dates and origins are explored. 16 of these workshops - nine from the monastery of St Catherine and seven from elsewhere, which produced bindings imported to the monastery, are discussed analytically.

40|$|Sequencing {{of large}} clones or small genomes is {{generally}} {{done by the}} shotgun approach (Anderson et al. 1982). This has two phases: (1) a shotgun phase in which a number of reads are generated from random subclones and assembled into contigs, followed by (2) a directed, or finishing phase in which the assembly is inspected for correctness and for various kinds of data anomalies (such as contaminant reads, unremoved vector sequence, and chimeric or deleted reads), additional data are collected to close gaps and resolve low quality regions, and editing is performed to correct assembly or base-calling errors.
