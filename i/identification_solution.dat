40|$|Due {{to growing}} traffic density on road systems new methods {{have to be}} {{developed}} to generate up-to-date traffic and safety information. The floating car data (FCD) concept is a promissing approach to generate and collect traffic related data. Data collection has a somewhat negative connotation, therefore, mechanisms to make data anonymous have to be used. In this paper we’ll present {{a new approach to}} depersonalize FCD information using a ticket-based <b>identification</b> <b>solution.</b> The whole system is relying on a telematics platform defined in the EU-project Global System for Telematics (GST).

The ticket-based <b>identification</b> <b>solution</b> enables the identification of viable data and the mapping of data to a certain account while still preserving the anonymity of the user. This new approach has primarily been designed for FCD systems, however, it can also be used in other contexts using a similar underlying system setup. 1...|$|E
40|$|Scene {{analysis}} {{is so far}} {{one of the most}} important topics in machine vision. In this paper, we present an integrated scene analysis model, namely SCENOGRAM (Scene analysis using CompositE Neural Oscillatory-based elastic GRAph Model). Basically the proposed scene analyzer is based on the integration of the composite neural oscillatory model with our elastic graph dynamic link model. The system involves: (1) multifrequency bands feature extraction scheme using Gabor filters, (2) automatic figure-ground object segmentation using a composite neural oscillatory model, and (3) object matching using an elastic graph dynamic link model. From the implementation point of view, we introduce an intelligent agent based scene analysis and object <b>identification</b> <b>solution</b> using the SCENOGRAM technology. From the experimental point of view, a scene gallery of over 6000 color scene images is used for automatic scene segmentation testing and object identification test. An overall correct invariant facial recognition rate of over 87 % is attained. It is anticipated that the implementation of the SCENOGRAM can provide an invariant and higher-order intelligent object (pattern) encoding, searching and <b>identification</b> <b>solution</b> for future intelligent e-Business.

We follow this by a discussion of the algorithms performance when constrained to frontal images and an analysis of its performance on a more complex dataset with significant head pose variation using 3 D face data for detection provides a promising route to improved performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{trends in}} the area of {{identity}} management have evolved from a traditional <b>identification</b> <b>solution</b> to a distributed user-centric identity management mechanism. The major goal of user-centric identity management is to enable the users to have control over their own digital identities. Even though existing identity management systems attempt to offer user-centricity where users possess complete control on their identity disclosure, however, it does not signify the consequences of the users ’ behavior. It is necessary to assist the users on the risk involved in disclosing their identity attributes. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware mechanism to help the users decide the degree of identity disclosure risk using ontology-based evaluation and privacy preference evaluation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on dynamic online social networks where the user’s identity plays a major role for access control and privacy management. I...|$|E
