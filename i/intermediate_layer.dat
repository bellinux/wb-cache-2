One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E

The foil consisted of an upper <b>layer</b> of lacquer/ <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> of polymer and Al/ a base layer {{of low melting point}} resin. Ablation of the foil was characterised by a sequential {{removal of the}} layers in the structure. A critical level of fluence and number of pulses was required to ablate each of the additional layers. Four threshold levels of damage have been identified as i) damage to the upper lacquer layer without removal, ii) the removal of the lacquer layer, iii) the removal of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> and iv) the removal of all layers.

30|$|These <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> have to {{be dealt}} with in order to achieve welding between two nanowires. One can induce high {{temperatures}} in resistive contacts through the electron scattering that occurs with current flow. Since the resistance of the system is highest at the contact points, heating is concentrated there, breaking down the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> with sufficient temperatures. This heating also locally melts the nanowires, causing a diffusion of ions which leads to welding at the point of contact.|$|R

The rock and mineral deposits are divided into three groups, consisting essentially of trachyte materials, constituted by pyroclastic deposits and flows resulting from explosive eruptions, lava flows and surges. The inferior layer includes most pyroclastic materials and volcanic products {{in the formation of the}} Povoação Ignimbrite (some 30000 years ago). The <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> includes material produced between 30,000 years and 5,000 years ago (reaching the Fogo A depoists).

25|$|The {{use of an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> to form an {{anti-reflection coating}} {{can be thought of}} as analoguous to the {{technique}} of impedance matching of electrical signals. (A similar method is used in fibre optic research, where an index-matching oil is sometimes used to temporarily defeat total internal reflection so that light may be coupled into or out of a fiber.) Further reduced reflection could in theory be made by extending the process to several layers of material, gradually blending the refractive index of each layer between the index of the air and the index of the substrate.|$|E
25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> (ILP), and the deep layer (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The electrocatalytic {{degradation}} {{performances of}} the Ti/Sb-SnO 2 electrodes with Ni, Co and Mn <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> prepared by thermal oxidation for phenol were studied. The microstructure and morphology of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> and the outer active layers were characterized by XRD, SEM and EDX. The content of phenol and intermediate material degraded with different electrodes in the phenol solution was compared by UV-Vis spectrophotometer and measuring COD. In the meantime, the influence of different <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> on the service life of anode was investigated by the accelerated life test. The experimental results showed that, after 10 h, the phenol degradation efficiency with Ti/Ni/Sb-SnO 2 electrode almost reached 100 % and the COD was 18 mg/L, but the electrode was irreversibly damaged within 20 min under the accelerated life test. Comparing with Ti/Ni/Sb-SnO 2, the degradation efficiency of phenol in Ti/Co/Sb-SnO 2 electrode was worse because the COD was 43 mg/L, but the accelerated life was 20. 8 h. For Ti/Mn/Sb-SnO 2 electrode, the COD was only 50 mg/L, but the accelerated life reached to 289 h. Therefore it may be concluded that the different <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> have a notable effect on the structure, morphology, service life and the electrocatalytic activity of anode...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{photolithography}} is used {{to initiate}} contact to silver nanowire junctions using gold electrodes. Using a common probe station, current is driven through the electrodes and, hence, the nanowires {{for the purpose of}} welding the two nanowires together. A welding procedure is prepared and tested for reliable welding of silver nanowires, which destroys <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> and welds the two nanowires. This procedure requires two steps, which is contrary to Joule heating recipes presented previously. Due to a lack of significant <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers,</b> other researchers were able to weld nano-objects together using constant current [13, 14] or constant voltage [15]. This method of welding is insufficient with this type of nanowire due to large initial resistances and breakdown behavior. This process is also applicable to other corrosion-prone nanowires such as copper and aluminum nanowires, as well as for other metal nanowires where fabrication processes introduce <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> at the contacts.|$|R
25|$|Windows NT uses kernel-mode device {{drivers to}} {{enable it to}} {{interact}} with hardware devices. Each of the drivers has well defined system routines and internal routines that it exports {{to the rest of}} the operating system. All devices are seen by user mode code as a file object in the I/O manager, though to the I/O manager itself the devices are seen as device objects, which it defines as either file, device or driver objects. Kernel mode drivers exist in three levels: highest level drivers, intermediate drivers and low level drivers. The highest level drivers, such as file system drivers for FAT and NTFS, rely on intermediate drivers. Intermediate drivers consist of function drivers—or main driver for a device—that are optionally sandwiched between lower and higher level filter drivers. The function driver then relies on a bus driver—or a driver that services a bus controller, adapter, or bridge—which can have an optional bus filter driver that sits between itself and the function driver. Intermediate drivers rely on the lowest level drivers to function. The Windows Driver Model (WDM) exists in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer.</b> The lowest level drivers are either legacy Windows NT device drivers that control a device directly or can be a PnP hardware bus. These lower level drivers directly control hardware and do not rely on any other drivers.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} very surface layers, the {{atmosphere}} {{is in a state}} of vigorous circulation. The upper layer of troposphere exhibits a phenomenon of super-rotation, in which the atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth days, much faster than the planet's sidereal day of 243 days. The winds supporting super-rotation blow at a speed of 100m/s (~360km/h or 220mph) or more. [...] Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed. On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower as the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the speed of 10km/h (2.8m/s) on the surface. Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar vortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern of clouds. Above there is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> of mesosphere which separates the troposphere from the thermosphere. The thermosphere is also characterized by strong circulation, but very different in its nature - the gases heated and partially ionized by sunlight in the sunlit hemisphere migrate to the dark hemisphere where they recombine and downwell.|$|E

We developed a theoretical model which {{makes it possible to}} calculate the shear properties in multi-cores.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{demonstrated that}} the forebrain commissures are the primary pathway for remapping from one hemifield to the other. Nonetheless, remapping in lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) across hemifield is still present in split brain monkeys. This finding indicates that a subcortical structure must contribute to remapping. The primary goal {{of the current study}} was to characterize remapping activity in the superior colliculus in intact and split brain monkeys. We recorded neurons in both the superficial and <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> of the SC. We found that across-hemifield remapping was reduced in magnitude and delayed compared with within-hemifield remapping in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> of the SC in split brain monkeys. These results mirror our previous findings in area LIP. In contrast, we found no difference in the magnitude or latency for within- compared with across-hemifield remapping in the superficial layers. At the behavioral level, we compared the performance of the monkeys on two conditions of a double-step task. When the second target remained within a single hemifield, performance remained accurate. When the second target had to be updated across hemifields, the split brain monkeys' performance was impaired. Remapping activity in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> was correlated with the accuracy and latency of the second saccade during the across-hemifield trials. Remapping in the superficial layers was correlated with latency of the second saccade during the within- and across-hemifield trials. The differences between the layers suggest that different circuits underlie remapping in the superficial and <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> of the superior colliculus...|$|R

2500|$|Practical anti-reflection coatings, however, rely on an <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> {{not only}} for its direct {{reduction}} of reflection coefficient, but also use the interference effect of a thin layer. Assume the layer's thickness is controlled precisely, such that it is exactly one quarter of the wavelength of light in the layer ( [...] , where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength). The layer is then called a quarter-wave coating. For this type of coating a normally incident beam I, when reflected from the second interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further than the beam reflected from the first surface, leading to destructive interference. This is also true for thicker coating layers (3λ/4, 5λ/4, etc.), however the anti-reflective performance is worse in this case due to the stronger dependence of the reflectance on wavelength and the angle of incidence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>layer</b> of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E

This recipe is designed specifically for removing the <b>intermediate</b> <b>layers</b> between metal contacts, and has applicability for welding corrosion-prone nanowires or where the electrode deposition procedure used results in such layers.
