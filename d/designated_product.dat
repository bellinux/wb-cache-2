50|$|The Pentax 6×7, <b>designated</b> <b>product</b> {{model number}} of 23400 by Asahi Pentax, {{is similar to}} any {{traditional}} 35mm SLR camera except in size. The hefty camera with a general dimension body of 7.25 inches × 4.5 inches × 3.75 inches / 18 cm × 11 cm × 9.5 cm and with the standard prism and 105 mm lens would bring it to 7.5 inches × 5.75 inches × 6.5inches / 18 cm × 14.5 cm × 17 cm. Users familiar with the diminutive cousins would find the Pentax 6×7 an easy transition due to {{the layout of the}} camera. Differing only in the location of the shutter speed knob as it is located on the left hand top. Location of the lens release is {{on the left side of}} the mirror housing, the shutter release and film advance lever are located on the right-hand side of the top. As naming conventions implies, the 6×7 indicates that this is a medium format camera and the negative produced is 6 cm by 7 cm (actual format 56mm X 70mm) and additionally the successors 67 and 67II remain the same format. The Pentax 6×7 has the ability to use either the 120 or 220 roll film, which produces ten or twenty respectively (twenty-one for the 1969 version). A small slotted selector on the right-hand side next under the film advance lever of the camera selects the film type (properly operated when film door is opened prior to selecting), and also the film pressure plate inside has positions for either type, the thickness of the films being different as it passes the 'main roller' towards the 'take-up' spool. The pressure plate also maintains film flatness in this horizontal design during exposure, aiding the extreme sharpness across the entire image for which the camera is renowned. Other systems use film tension alone, or against rails at the film's edge, in more compact vertical-feed magazines found in 6×6 or 6×4.5 formats. The synonymous or standard equipment includes the Super Takumar and later the Super-Multi-Coated TAKUMAR/6×7 1:2.4 f=105 lens and the pentaprism finder that allows for the 'through-the-lens actual image (90% of actual area) of what is being composed.|$|E
