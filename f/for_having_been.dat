5|$|Justice Phang {{also held}} that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not {{necessarily}} determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> made in bad faith. However, the provision applied in this case as no bad faith on the Collector's part had been alleged by the appellants.|$|E

5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln {{was seized by}} the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds.

The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E

5|$|Courteney Cox portrays Monica Geller, {{the mother}} hen {{of the group}} and a chef, known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and {{obsessive-compulsive}} nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> extremely overweight as a child, especially by her brother Ross. Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica’s first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time, until Richard expresses that {{he does not want to}} have children, much to Monica’s dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his existing circle of supporters, {{many of whom were}} richly rewarded with new lands, Henry quickly co-opted many of the existing administration into his new royal household. William Giffard, William Rufus's chancellor, was made the Bishop of Winchester, and the prominent sheriffs Urse d'Abetot, Haimo Dapifer and Robert Fitzhamon continued to play a senior role in government. By contrast, the unpopular Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham and a key member of the previous regime, was imprisoned in the Tower of London and charged with corruption. The late king had left many church positions unfilled, and Henry set about nominating candidates to these, in an effort to build further support for his new government. The appointments needed to be consecrated, and Henry wrote to Anselm, apologising <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> crowned while the Archbishop was still in France and asking him to return at once.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asia abounds {{with tales}} of {{historic}} cannon: many {{are said to be}} imbued with supernatural powers; some are revered for their cultural and spiritual significance; others are notable <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> present at defining moments in the region's history. Burma's Glass Palace Chronicle recounts a story about the Burmese-Siamese war (1765–1767) that illustrates the divine properties ascribed to certain cannon. After attempts to repel Burmese attacks on the Siamese capital had proved unsuccessful, the King of Siam ordered that the city's guardian spirit, a great cannon called Dwarawadi, be used to halt the advance. The gun was ceremoniously hoisted and aimed at the enemy's camp, but the powder failed to ignite. Fearing the guardian of the city had abandoned them, the king's officials implored their sovereign to surrender.|$|E

5|$|When Radama died {{without leaving}} any {{descendants}} on July 27, 1828, {{according to local}} custom, the rightful heir was Rakotobe, the eldest son of Radama's eldest sister. An intelligent and amiable young man, Rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the London Missionary Society in Antananarivo {{on the grounds of}} the royal palace. Radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of Rakotobe. However, they hesitated to report the news of Radama's death for several days, fearing possible reprisals against them <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> involved in denouncing one of the king's rivals, whose family had a stake in the succession after Radama. During this time, another courtier, a high-ranking military officer named Andriamamba, discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – Andriamihaja, Rainijohary and Ravalontsalama – to support Ramavo's claim to the throne.|$|E
5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending {{the better part of}} the next two years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E
