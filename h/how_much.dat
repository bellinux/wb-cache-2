5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence <b>how</b> <b>much</b> material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), <b>how</b> <b>much</b> from Belleforest or Saxo, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version {{which are not}} in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the glans protrudes from the hood and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E

5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is to determine <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, {{in order to minimize}} cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E

5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{is the work of}} others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E
