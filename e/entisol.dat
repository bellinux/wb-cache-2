40|$|The {{fertility}} {{status of}} Alfisols, Incepptisols and <b>Entisols</b> in the Gubi soil series were evaluated. The soils were generally slightly acid to moderately acid and the pH was significantly (p< 0. 01) {{higher in the}} lower horizons than in the surface horizons. Exchangeable acidity was low in the Alfisols and Inceptisols and high in one profile of the <b>Entisols</b> with a significant (p< 0. 01) difference between the profile contents. Exchangeable bases were high to medium in the Alfisols, while in the Inceptisols calcium content was high; magnesium medium, potassium and sodium were low. In the <b>Entisols,</b> calcium content was high with medium magnesium and sodium contents and low potassium. Magnesium and sodium were significantly (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05) different between profiles. The sodium, content of the three soil orders was also significantly (p< 0. 01) different, <b>Entisols</b> had significantly higher values than the other soils. Cation Exchange Capacity was medium to high in Alfisols and medium in the Inceptisols and <b>Entisols</b> while base saturation was medium in the Alfisols and Inceptisols and high (statistically p< 0. 01 different) in the <b>Entisols.</b> Organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus were generally low across the soil orders. Intensive cultivation with increase use of organic matter and careful application of inorganic fertilizers is suggested for optimum crop production...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Entisol</b> - {{recently}} formed soils {{that lack}} well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments {{of sand and}} clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.|$|E
50|$|In USDA soil taxonomy, entisols {{are defined}} as soils that do not show any profile {{development}} other than an A horizon. An <b>entisol</b> has no diagnostic horizons, and most are basically unaltered from their parent material, which can be unconsolidated sediment or rock.

50|$|In USDA soil taxonomy, a psamment {{is defined}} as an <b>entisol</b> which {{consists}} basically of unconsolidated sand deposits, often found in shifting sand dunes but also in areas of very coarse-textured parent material subject to {{millions of years of}} weathering.

A psamment has no distinct soil horizons, and must consist entirely of material of loamy sand or coarser in texture. In the FAO soil classification, psamments are known as arenosols.|$|E
50|$|Black walnut is more {{resistant}} to frost than the English or Persian walnut, but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly. Some soils preferred by black walnut include Alfisol and <b>Entisol</b> soil types. Walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils {{due to the fact}} that these soils hold large quantities of water which the tree draws from during dry periods.|$|E
50|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} inland scrub is a shrubland community {{found on}} the Florida peninsula. The largest remaining blocks of inland scrub are {{in and around the}} Ocala National Forest and in the Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge. The Archbold Biological Station near Lake Placid contains about 20 km2 of scrub habitat and sponsors biological research on it. The scrub occurs on a series of north-south running ridges composed of sand derived from ancient dune fields. The soil, a type of <b>entisol,</b> is derived from quartz and is low in organic matter, silt, and clay. Because the low-nutrient sandy soils do not retain moisture, the ecosystem is effectively an arid one.|$|E

50|$|Las Lajas {{is located}} on the right shore of Agrio River at the Andean foothills, where National Routes 22 and 40. The Pino Hachado Pass, which joins Argentina and Chile, is 52 km west of the town. Las Lajas is 58 km from Zapala, 242 km from Neuquén City and 1455 km from Buenos Aires. It has an {{elevation}} 703 m above mean sea level (AMSL). The local poorly developed soils are composed of a low percentage in organic matter. They belong to the <b>entisol</b> and aridisol orders of the USDA soil taxonomy. Besides the Agrio River, waterways in the area include the Las Lajitas and Liu Cullín Creeks.|$|E
5000|$|After 2005, {{treatment}} goals shifted towards [...] "passive {{oak wilt}} control" [...] on properties less than 5 acres and, for large acreages, treating to natural barriers or edges, especially when managing northern pin oaks on <b>entisol</b> soils. Passive control means letting the disease burn {{out over a}} few years and allowing native species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; re-developing monocultures of oaks that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years are long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that are}} taken into account to decide what type of farming should take place on a certain area of land including, topography, altitude, exposure, and rainfall. Soil plays a large role in {{determining}} how land will be used. Mollisol lands are typically described as semi-arid to semi- humid areas that are grassy. This is where most intensive cattle operations occur which produce beef and dairy. Although a majority of pastoral farming is conducted in Mollisol lands, pastoral farming can also be found in areas with soil made up of <b>Entisol,</b> Aridisol or Alfisol. Aside from soil order, pastoral farming {{is more likely to be}} found than arable farming in areas with steep slopes, cold strong winds and a wet climate. [...] All of these conditions are more advantageous to raising live stock than crops. Raising of sheep is often found in cooler regions with steep hills and above average rain fall. The wetness of the area and incline would make it unsuitable to grow crops. A similar conclusion is drawn by looking at dairy farms which are often found in warm wet climates.|$|E

40|$|The {{extended}} {{logistic model}} has proven very convenient for describing crop response (yield and plant nutrient uptake) to applied nutrients such as nitrogen.

50|$|In USDA soil taxonomy, orthents {{are defined}} as <b>entisols</b> that lack horizon {{development}} due to either steep slopes or parent materials that contain no permanent weatherable minerals (such as ironstone). Typically, Orthents are exceedingly shallow soils. They are {{often referred to as}} skeletal soils or, in the FAO soil classification, as lithosols.

Three soils were selected, <b>Entisol,</b> Anthrosol and Luvisol from north, central and south Shaanxi, respectively. Nitrification and NH 4 fixation were measured using a closed chamber method in the laboratory. Denitrification was tested in the laboratory with intact soil cores, C 2 H 2 inhibition techniques.
