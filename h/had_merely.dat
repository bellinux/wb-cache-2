5|$|Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt {{and highly}} excitable {{scientist}} {{in charge of}} research at Area 51. Dr. Okun {{appeared to have been}} killed by an alien but returned in the sequel, where it was revealed that the character <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> been in a coma. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E

At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York {{was better than the}} situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered whether she <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E

Johor had at no time ceded the island to the United Kingdom, but instead <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> granted permission for the lighthouse to be built and maintained on it.|$|E
5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.â€“Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing {{a substantial amount of}} hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> twitched.|$|E

Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E

Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed {{that the man had}} suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005.

Johor had not ceded Pedra Branca to the United Kingdom, but <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> granted permission for the lighthouse {{to be built}} and maintained on it. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. Further, the 1953 letter had been unauthorised and the official reports and maps it had issued were either irrelevant or inconclusive.|$|E

Harrison omitted his name {{from the list of}} performing musicians, leading to an assumption that he <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> produced and arranged the music. The 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music recognises his contributions on keyboards and guitar. The album was first remastered for CD release in 1992, for which former Apple executive Derek Taylor supplied a liner-note essay.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{claims that}} the new decipherments were merely a {{corroboration}} of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear {{the degree to which}} his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized {{that he would have to}} make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> deciphered a few words. Over the next year he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E
5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Romeâ€”for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing himâ€”and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a childâ€”Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E

5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the KlosterstraÃŸe vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the MÃ¤rkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the JudenstraÃŸe vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and <b>had</b> <b>merely</b> been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing JÃ¼denstraÃŸe. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E
