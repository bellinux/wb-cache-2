The problems that arise due to communication using arrays are interference between simultaneous transmissions and misalignment due to vibration. This paper addresses interference caused by simultaneous transmissions by the multiple elements. We model the interference as noise and find the probability of error. We present design guidelines for a <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation</b> based on the distance, number of optical transceivers (elements) that can be packed in a given array area, and the achievable aggregate bandwidth. ...|$|E
40|$|The uplink of an {{asynchronous}} Detect and Forward CDMA {{wireless network}} interference tolerance is investigated {{in this paper}} where relays and base station use Adaptive Multiuser Detection to detect incoming signals. Relays exchange data and channel information with the base station to achieve diversity gains. Due to non orthogonality of random spreading waveforms, Multiple Access Interference occurs, at both the relays and base station. In order to mitigate Multiple Access Interference, Adaptive Multiuser detection is been used by fractionally spaced linear transversal bank of filters. It is shown that Adaptive Multiuser Detection enables asynchronous cooperative communications while it is extremely effective with mitigating channel interference. It is also shown that the BER and Capacity performance of the scheme proposed in this paper is arbitrarily close to non linear MLSE theoretical upper bound results in a channel <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation.</b> However, {{in the presence of}} channel interference our scheme outperforms the theoretical upper bound approach by nearly 9 dB at a BER of 10 − 3 and by 17 bits/s/Hz in Capacity at a SNR of 30 dB...|$|E

40|$|Several {{instruments}} {{have been}} developed to measure low concentrations of hydrazine but none completely meet the sensitivity requirements while satisfying additional criteria such as quick response, stable calibration, <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation,</b> online operation, reasonable cost, etc. A brief review is presented of the current technology including the electrochemical cell, the ion mobility spectrometer, the mass spectrometer, and the gas chromatograph. A review of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these instruments are presented here. The review also includes commercially unavailable technology such as the electronic nose and the Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) IR Spectrometer. It was found that the TDL could meet the majority of these criteria including fast response, minimum maintenance, portability, and reasonable cost. An experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of such a system using an existing (non-portable) instrument. A lead-salt tunable diode laser, cooled to 85 degrees Kelvin was used to record direct absorption and second-derivative spectra of Hydrazine at several pressures to study the sensitivity to low levels of Hydrazine. Spectra of NH 3 and CO 2 were used for wavelength identification of the scanned region. With a pathlength of 80 m, detection sensitivities of about 1 ppb were achieved for hydrazine in dry nitrogen at a cell pressure of 100 mbar. For spectroscopic detection of Hydrazine, spectral regions including strong Ammonia or Carbon Dioxide lines must be avoided. Strong Hydrazine absorption features were identified at 940 /cm showing minimal contribution from Ammonia interferences as suitable candidates for Hydrazine gas detection. For the studies reported here, the particular laser diode could only cover the narrow regions near 962 /cm and 965 /cm where strong Ammonia interferences were expected. However, the high resolution (0. 001 /cm) of the TDL spectrometer allowed individual lines of Hydrazine to be identified away from interferences from either Ammonia or Carbon Dioxide, especially at lower pressures. A Hydrazine line was identified at 961. 75 /cm which was free from Ammonia absorption and would be suitable to monitor hydrazine levels. This paper also shows data on the degradation of the detectivity of Hydrazine with increasing pressure. Several design options for a portable unit are presented, including designs with near IR and Quantum Cascade laser components which do not require liquid nitrogen cooling...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a variety}} of both {{portable}} and fixed gas monitors onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Devices range from rack-mounted mass spectrometers to hand-held electrochemical sensors. An optical Multi-Gas Monitor has been developed as an ISS Technology Demonstration to evaluate long-term continuous measurement of 4 gases. Based on tunable diode laser spectroscopy, this technology offers unprecedented selectivity, concentration range, precision, and calibration stability. The monitor utilizes the combination of high performance laser absorption spectroscopy with a rugged optical path length enhancement cell that is nearly impossible to misalign. The enhancement cell serves simultaneously as the measurement sampling cell for multiple laser channels operating within a common measurement volume. Four laser diode based detection channels allow quantitative determination of ISS cabin concentrations of water vapor (humidity), carbon dioxide, ammonia and oxygen. Each channel utilizes a separate vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) at a different wavelength. In addition to measuring major air constituents in their relevant ranges, the multiple gas monitor provides real time quantitative gaseous ammonia measurements between 5 and 20, 000 parts-per-million (ppm). A small ventilation fan draws air with no pumps or valves into the enclosure in which analysis occurs. Power draw is only about 3 W from USB sources when installed in Nanoracks or when connected to 28 V source from any EXPRESS rack interface. Internal battery power can run the sensor for over 20 hours during portable operation. The sensor is controlled digitally with an FPGA/microcontroller architecture that stores data internally while displaying running average measurements on an LCD screen and interfacing with the rack or laptop via USB. Design, construction and certification of the Multi-Gas Monitor were a joint effort between Vista Photonics, Nanoracks and NASA-Johnson Space Center (JSC). Vista Photonics developed the core technology and built the sensor. Nanoracks designed, constructed the enclosure, interfaces, and battery power management circuitry, integrated all subsystems into the enclosure, and then managed the certification tests, documentation and manifesting. The unit was calibrated in the JSC Toxicology Laboratory. The Multi-Gas Monitor is manifested to fly as a technology demonstration to the ISS in November 2013 and will operate for at least 6 months with data sent to the ground for evaluation. The primary goal is to demonstrate long term <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation</b> in the real spacecraft environment...|$|E
