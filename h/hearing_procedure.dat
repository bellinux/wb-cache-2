40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the whole disciplinary procedure {{for the police}} officers in the Republic of Croatia, including statistical data for the procedures conducted from 2002 to 2005 at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In {{the introductory part of}} the paper, the author has emphasised the importance of police service as well as of respect for the duties of the police officers, stressing that police officers are held responsible for improper behaviour both at and outside work. The concept and character of disciplinary responsibility of police officers, general prerequisites for disciplinary responsibility, bodies in charge of conducting the procedure, and the parties to the procedure are analysed next. Analysing procedural provisions according to which disciplinary procedure is conducted, the author emphasises the inadequacies in implementation of the Law on Criminal Proceedings and the Law on General Administrative Procedure, and stresses the necessity of passing a special law that would regulate that area comprehensively. Then follow the chapters on instituting the procedure, oral <b>hearing,</b> <b>procedure</b> costs, statute of limitations for institution and conduct of the procedures, types of disciplinary offences and disciplinary sanctions, legal remedies, and court protection. Statistical analysis of the work performed at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures (Ministry of Internal Affairs) outlines all disciplinary procedures conducted against police officers. The author analyses individual institutes and identifies previous regulations, regulations concerning disciplinary responsibility of other state civil servants, judges and district attorneys, normative solutions in comparative legislation, and judgements of disciplinary courts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Administrative Court, the Constitutional Court, and the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, the author suggests changes of certain regulations in order to ensure efficiency and eliminate normative dilemmas in the conduct of disciplinary procedures. He is of the opinion {{that it is necessary to}} retain specialised disciplinary courts within the Ministry of Internal Affairs due to the specific nature of police service and the required efficiency and legality of its functioning...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, the European Commission adopted {{its first}} {{legislative}} instrument for comprehensive {{protection of the}} marine environment, the Marine Strategy Framework  Directive (MSFD). By the end of 2012, the first concrete steps have been taken {{in the implementation of}} the directive, including its transposition into national legislations and the preparation of {{the first phase of the}} national marine strategies, i. e. Initial Assessment (IA) (Art. 8), Determination of Good Environmental Status (GES) (Art. 9), and Setting Environmental Targets and Indicators (Art. 10). These steps aim at national marine strategies that will further include a Monitoring Programme and a Programme of Measures. The aim of this report is to describe and compare the different preparation processes the MSFD enacted in Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Finland. Throughout the Baltic Sea region, the preparation process has been supported by informal EU level working groups as well as by HELCOM working groups and projects. While the former WGs have concentrated on creating common understanding and providing guidelines for the process, the contribution of the latter ones has been mainly on providing relevant information (i. e. assessments and indicators) for the Baltic Sea region. This study was conducted between June and October 2012 and therefore the observations presented in this report reflect to the processes that took place up to October 2012.   The MSFD had been transposed into national legislation in all of the case countries apart from Poland in which the transposition is expected to be finalised by the end of 2012. The delay in the transposition process has significant consequences to the preparation process of Polish national marine strategy. However, all of the four countries failed to finalise the first phase of the national marine strategies (i. e. articles 8, 9 and 10 of the directive) by July 15 th 2012, as was required by the directive. Furthermore, the directive stipulated that the first phases of the national marine strategies are reported to the Commission by October 15 th 2012, but Denmark was the only country able to report the complete first phase of its national marine strategy to the Commission by the established deadline.   The preparation processes and the modes of operation varied regarding, for example, the division of responsibilities in the preparation process. In Denmark and Sweden the responsibility for implementing the MSFD was given to a single agency, whereas in Poland and Finland the responsibility was shared between three ministries and their respective administrative sectors. In Denmark and Poland, the preparation of articles 8, 9 and 10 were outsourced through tendering to national research institutes, universities and a consultancy company (in Denmark), whereas in Finland and Sweden, the related authorities (government agencies and institutes) have carried out the preparatory work as a part of their official duties.   In all of the four countries, relevant administrative sectors participated in the preparation process, however, wider stakeholder participation was organised only through the hearing procedures. The <b>hearing</b> <b>procedure</b> was organised in Finland and Sweden in the spring of 2012 and in Denmark over the summer of 2012. The procedure will be organised in Poland after the transposition of the MSFD has been finalised. Despite of the short – only 4 weeks long – hearing procedures over a hundred comments were received in Finland and over seventy in Sweden. In Denmark, the process lasted for 12 weeks and 28 comments were received. KnowSeas - Knowledge-based Sustainable Management of Europe's Sea...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{purpose of}} this mini-dissertation is to explore the labour law {{consequences}} when a director of a company is dismissed. The underlying questions that come forward are: What legislation protects the director in his various roles? What remedies are available? Is a director an employee and can his office as director be distinguished from his post as employee? A company as a separate entity is compelled to perform its corporate functions by means of its directors, officials and employees. The mere fact {{that a person is}} the director of a company does not mean that he is a representative or an employee. A director will be an employee once he enters into a contract of employment. A director that performs personal services and is responsible to the board 1 s held to be an employee. The company statutes regulate the appointment and removal of a director, thus the shareholders are responsible for the decision. In terms of the common law the appointment of a company director is complete when a person with the competence to appoint a director makes the appointment and the appointee accepts the offer. The removal of a director must be substantively fair, the true and valid reasons for the removal must thus be given. The removal must also be procedurally fair, this entails that certain steps must be taken. Failure to comply with this makes the dismissal unfair. The dismissal of a senior employee is not an exception to the rule; that a fair <b>hearing</b> <b>procedure</b> must still be complied with. I shall briefly discuss several cases on the courts' view of a director as an employee of the company. In PG Group (Pty) Ltd v Mbambo NO & others 2005 1 BLLR 71 (LC) the labour court found that section 213 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 is formulated wide enough to encompass most directors. In Oak Industries (SA) (Pty) Ltd v John NO & Another 1987 8 ILJ 756 the court ruled that there is no absolute rule stating that a director cannot be an employee; notwithstanding any definition of the word employee in legislature. In Sage v Fourwinds Transporl CO (Pty) Ltd 1994 8 BLLR 114 (IC) the Industrial court ruled that an employee is an employee in spite of his status in the organisation. Lastly in Pearson v Sheerbonnet South Africa (Pty) Ltd 1999 7 BLLR 703 (LC) was the director held to be an employee on the grounds that he had an employment contract with the company. The entity towards which the director owes fiduciary duties is the company. There is no standard of competence, rights or duties attached to the office of director. These are determined by the companies' statutes. memorandum of association, the common law and the applicable contract. The common law requires the director to exercise his duties in good faith and to the advantage of the company and he also has a duty to take reasonable care. The director's common law and statutory duties exist as one. There is no prescript in the statute or clause in a contract that can free a director of responsibility towards the company that develops out of his negligence, failure or dereliction of duty. Section 248 of the Company Act 61 of 1973 frees a director where it appears that he acted honestly and reasonably. The mere fact that the court disagrees with the director is not a ground for responsibility. The director is responsible for the company damages when he does not use the necessary skill and care. Any legal competent person can be a company director. Section 218 (l) (d) (iii) of the Company Act 61 of 1973 compels the court to refuse to grant permission to a person to act as a company director if the person was found guilty of theft, fraud, perjury or any crime that includes dishonesty in terms of the founding or management of a company and is sent to jail with or without the option of a fine or is fined more than R 100.

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created, {{among other}} things, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an entity within the U. S. Department of the Treasury tasked with {{assessing}} and mitigating financial risk. Financial institutions with over $ 50 {{billion in assets}} are automatically deemed “systemically important. ” However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, FSOC {{has the authority to}} designate non-bank companies engaged in financial activity as systemically important as well. Once designated as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), these companies are subject to enhanced regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. Because the costs associated with such enhanced regulation are significant, most companies do not actively welcome a SIFI label. In 2016, two of the four non-bank SIFIs (GE Capital and MetLife, Inc.) had their SIFI labels rescinded. GE was able to shed its SIFI label by minimizing the size of its assets and operations.

A number of cases with enhancing MRI images in the internal anditory canal were reoperated, permitting the histologic examination of the enhancing tissue. Criteria for the MRI diagnosis of residual-recurrent acoustic neuroma are presented, along with the short-to mid-term rate of “residual-recurrent” tumor...|$|R
