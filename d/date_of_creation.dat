25|$|From Justinian's decree in AD 537 {{that all}} dates must include the Indiction, the {{unification}} of the theological <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> (as yet unfinalized) with the administrative system of Indiction cycles became commonly referred to amongst Byzantine authors, to whom the indiction was the standard measurement of time.|$|E
25|$|Among the Masoretic {{creation}} estimates or calculations for the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> Ussher's specific chronology dating {{the creation}} to 4004 BC {{became the most}} accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date {{was attached to the}} King James Bible. The youngest ever recorded <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> within the historic Jewish or Christian traditions is 3616 BC, by Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller in the 17th century while the oldest proposed date was 6984 BC by Alfonso X of Castile. However some contemporary or more recent proponents of Young Earth Creationism have taken this figure back further by several thousands of years by proposing significant gaps in the genealogies in chapters 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis. Harold Camping for example dated the creation to 11,013 BC, while Christian Charles Josias Bunsen in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.|$|E

25|$|The exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, {{as well as}} who was {{the first}} leader of the church. Predominantly it is {{considered}} that the first head was Michael I of Kiev, however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the Church of the Tithes. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter Yuriy-upon-Ros. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the Council of Bari in 1098.|$|E
25|$|After the Masoretic {{text was}} published, dating {{creation}} around 4000 BC became common, and was received with wide support. Proposed calculations of the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation,</b> using the Masoretic from the 10th century – 18th century include: Marianus Scotus (4192 BC), Maimonides (4058 BC), Henri Spondanus (4051 BC), Benedict Pereira (4021 BC), Louis Cappel (4005 BC), James Ussher (4004 BC), Augustin Calmet (4002 BC), Isaac Newton (4000 BC), Johannes Kepler (27 April, 3977 BC) , Petavius (3984 BC), Theodore Bibliander (3980 BC), Christen Sørensen Longomontanus (3966 BC), Melanchthon (3964 BC), Martin Luther (3961 BC), John Lightfoot (3960 BC), Cornelius Cornelii a Lapide (3951 BC) Joseph Justus Scaliger (3949 BC), Christoph Helvig (3947 BC), Gerardus Mercator (3928 BC), Matthieu Brouard (3927 BC), Benito Arias Montano (3849 BC), Andreas Helwig (3836 BC), David Gans (3761 BC) and Gershom ben Judah (3754 BC).|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} was widely covered in Japanese media. Given its speculated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation,</b> the film {{would have been}} contemporary to—or even have predated—early animated works by Cohl and the American animators J.Stuart Blackton and Winsor McCay.

500|$|Another {{example is}} Stela 1 at Coba which marks the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>creation</b> as , or {{nineteen}} units above the b'ak'tun.

Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.|$|E

2500|$|The {{calendar}} {{was based}} on the Julian calendar, except that the year started on 1 September and the year number used an Anno Mundi epoch derived from the Septuagint version of the Bible.

2500|$|It {{may be an}} {{accident}} of history that Ussher's chronology remains so well known while those of Scaliger and Bede, amongst others, have slipped into obscurity. From William Lloyd's 1701 edition onwards, annotated editions of the immensely influential King James translation of the Bible began to include his revised chronology with their marginal annotations and cross-references. [...] The first page of Genesis was annotated with Ussher's <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Creation,</b> 4004 BC. [...] It {{was included in the}} widely distributed Scofield Reference Bible.

2500|$|According to rabbinic reckoning, the {{beginning}} of [...] "year 1" [...] is not Creation, but about one year before Creation, with the new moon of its first month (Tishrei) to be called molad tohu (the mean new moon of chaos or nothing).

After the July Revolution, the school regained its original name of École normale and in 1845 was renamed École normale supérieure. During the 1830s, under the direction of philosopher Victor Cousin, the school enhanced its status as an institution to prepare the agrégation by expanding the duration of study to three years, and was divided into its present-day [...] "Sciences" [...] and [...] "Letters" [...] divisions. In 1847 the school moved into its current quarters at the rue d'Ulm, next to the Panthéon in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.

2500|$|Biblical literalist {{chronology}} is {{the attempt}} to correlate the theological dates used in the Bible with the real chronology of actual events. The Bible measures time from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Creation</b> (years are measured as anno mundi, or AM, meaning Year of the World), {{but there is no}} agreement on when this was, some of the better-known alternatives including Archbishop James Ussher, who placed it in 4004 BC, Isaac Newton in 4000 BC, Martin Luther in 3961 BC, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BC, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the Septuagint, of 5009 BC. To the foundation of the Temple of Solomon the passage of time is measured by simple addition of from the Creation; for later periods it measures time by the reigns of kings, but the data is conflicting and there is no agreement on how to resolve the problems.|$|E
