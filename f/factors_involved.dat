5|$|The move to {{functional}} classification {{coincided with the}} rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental <b>factors</b> <b>involved.</b> The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E

25|$|Replication {{machineries}} {{consist of}} <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In {{most of the}} bacteria, all of the <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called replisomes or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{chemical}} and physical <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in ion suppression {{are not fully}} understood, it has been proposed that basicity, high concentration, mass and more intuitively, co-elution with the analyte of interest are factors which should not be ignored.|$|E

25|$|The subcommissural organ/Reissner’s fiber {{complex is}} one of the <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in the {{cerebrospinal}} fluid reabsorption and circulation, which under normal physiological conditions, is secreted continuously, although this secretion undergoes circadian variations.

25|$|There {{are several}} <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in {{producing}} different pitches on a brass instrument. Slides, valves, crooks (though {{they are rarely}} used today), or keys are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available harmonic series, while the player's embouchure, lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{plasmids}} {{has been}} validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, {{this approach has}} failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in the specific activation of immune effector cells.|$|E
25|$|In a dry socket, {{healing is}} delayed because tissue must grow from the {{surrounding}} gingival mucosa, which takes longer than the normal organisation of a blood clot. Some patients may develop short term halitosis, {{which is the result}} of food debris stagnating in the socket and the subsequent action of halitogenic bacteria. The main <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in the development of dry socket are discussed below.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{understanding}} what drives atheroma development is complex with multiple <b>factors</b> <b>involved,</b> {{only some of}} which, such as lipoproteins, more importantly lipoprotein subclass analysis, blood sugar levels and hypertension are best known and researched. More recently, some of the complex immune system patterns that promote, or inhibit, the inherent inflammatory macrophage triggering processes involved in atheroma progression are slowly being better elucidated in animal models of atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this method}} does not {{directly}} provide a single fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for computing the parameter value for a given graph with unknown k, {{because of the difficulty}} of determining the set of forbidden minors. Additionally, the large constant <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in these results make them highly impractical. Therefore, the development of explicit fixed-parameter algorithms for these problems, with improved dependence on k, has continued to be an important line of research.|$|E
25|$|A similar annual pattern {{occurs in}} salinity. There {{is a clear}} {{seasonal}} variation, with values ranging from a summer high of around 35.7 ppt, to a winter low of around 35.4 ppt. As with water temperatures, the variability in salinity is much smaller than in coastal waters, where summer salinity reaches 36.4 ppt. This difference {{is partly due to}} the low-salinity waters of the Leeuwin Current, but {{there are a number of}} other <b>factors</b> <b>involved,</b> including high evaporation of coastal waters in summer.|$|E

25|$|Some {{research}} suggests {{that there may be}} a degree of inherited susceptibility to develop sleep bruxism. 21–50% of people with sleep bruxism have a direct family member who had sleep bruxism during childhood, suggesting that there are genetic <b>factors</b> <b>involved,</b> although no genetic markers have yet been identified. Offspring of people who have sleep bruxism are more likely to also have sleep bruxism than children of people who do not have bruxism, or people with awake bruxism rather than sleep bruxism.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{approach}} has been widely criticized as ignoring several key <b>factors</b> <b>involved</b> in fisheries management and {{has led to the}} devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among conservation biologists it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{referred}} to the conflict as a civil war, with other <b>factors</b> <b>involved.</b> The Korean War was the first armed confrontation of the Cold War and {{set the standard for}} many later conflicts. It is often viewed {{as an example of the}} proxy war, where the two superpowers would fight in another country, forcing the people in that country to suffer most of the destruction and death involved in a war between such large nations. The superpowers avoided descending into an all-out war against one another, as well as the mutual use of nuclear weapons. It expanded the Cold War, which to that point had mostly been concerned with Europe.|$|E
