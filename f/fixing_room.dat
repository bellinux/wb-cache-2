40|$|For many decades, {{solving the}} optimal {{architectural}} layout design is unattainable for the reasonable problem sizes. Architects {{have to settle}} for acceptable layouts instead of the favourable optimal solution. With today technologies, various optimization techniques have been used to alleviate the optimal search according to diversified goals. This paper formulates the optimal architectural layout design as the multiobjective mixed integer programming model solved by the MIP solver. The main idea is to capture functional constraints, dimensional constraints and the objective function using only linear formulae with binary variables. Functional constraints are the connectivities, the unused grid cells, the <b>fixed</b> <b>room</b> location, the boundary and the fixed border location while dimension constraints are the non-intersecting, the overlapping, the length and the ratio constraints. The objective function is designed to minimize the absolute distance among rooms and maximize room spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of area computation, the linear approximation of width and height constraints have been utilized. Architects can control these different objectives within the model. By specifying the rigid restriction and the time limits, the problem can be solved within a reasonable amount of time...|$|R

In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|R

40|$|Peripheral {{blood as}} a {{surrogate}} tissue for transcriptome profiling holds great promise for the discovery of diagnostic and prognostic disease biomarkers, particularly when target tissues of disease are not readily available. To maximize the reliability of gene expression data generated from clinical blood samples, both the sample collection and the microarray probe generation methods should be optimized to provide stabilized, reproducible and representative gene expression profiles faithfully representing the transcriptional profiles of the constituent blood cell types present in the circulation. Given the increasing innovation in this field in recent years, we investigated a combination of methodological advances in both RNA stabilisation and microarray probe generation {{with the goal of}} achieving robust, reliable and representative transcriptional profiles from whole blood. To assess the whole blood profiles, the transcriptomes of purified blood cell types were measured and compared with the global transcriptomes measured in whole blood. The results demonstrate that a combination of PAXgeneTM RNA stabilising technology and single-stranded cDNA probe generation afforded by the NuGEN Ovation RNA amplification system V 2 TM enables an approach that yields faithful representation of specific hematopoietic cell lineage transcriptomes in whole blood without the necessity for prior sample fractionation, cell enrichment or globin reduction. Storage stability assessments of the PAXgeneTM blood samples also advocate a short, <b>fixed</b> <b>room</b> temperature storage time for all PAXgeneTM blood samples collected for the purposes of global transcriptional profiling in clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the chromophoric {{fraction}} of {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) in natural waters using its fluorescence signal is extremely useful {{in a variety of}} marine and freshwater applications. The aim of this research was to study the changes in CDOM optical properties at low temperatures and during ice formation from seawater. In a laboratory study it was found that CDOM fluorescence intensity reversibly decreases with increasing water temperature. The study of the temperature effect is important for future calibration of lidar data measured in regions with horizontal temperature gradients, and for correction of in situ measured CDOM fluorescence depth profiles. Changes in CDOM fluorescence due to variations in concentration and possibly composition under controlled conditions of ice cover developing were studied during experiments using artificial ice sheets produced in large-scale tank experiments. Fluorescence emission, fluorescence excitation and absorption spectra of filtered samples from ice, ice brine and melted ice were measured in the laboratory at <b>fixed</b> <b>room</b> temperature. Sea ice brines showed high fluorescence signals due to the accumulation of CDOM in channels filled with brine during ice growth. CDOM fluorescence slightly increased in seawater underlying the ice sheet due to exclusion of DOM from ice. Ice samples separated from brine had low fluorescence signals. Humic-type fluorescence intensity (270, 308 or 355 nm excitation) was directly proportional to salinity as well as to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in many samples of ice to highly concentrated brine...|$|R
