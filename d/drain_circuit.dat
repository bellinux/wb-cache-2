40|$|Abstract-We {{report the}} effect of {{negative}} differential resistance (NDR) in the <b>drain</b> <b>circuit</b> of {{a new type of}} selectively-doped AlGaAs/ GaAs heterojunction transistor. The key new element of our structure is the presence of a subsidiary GaAs conducting layer, separated from the FET channel by an AlGaAs graded barrier. In this work the subsidiary layer is realized by the conducting substrate. The NDR effect arises due to the heating of channel electrons by the source-todrain field, and the subsequent charge injection over the barrier. This effect is strongly influenced by the gate and substrate voltages. In a floating-substrate arrangement the current-voltage characteristics exhibit memory effects associated with retention of injected charge in the substrate. In this mode, the NDR is seen only at low temperatures with the peak-to-valley ratios in current at 77 K reaching values as high as 30. On the other hand, when the substrate is biased positively, the NDR results from a peculiar effect of dynamical channel depletion by the injected space charge which drifts on the downhill slope of the graded barrier. In this case, the NDR is observed even at room temperature...|$|E

Despite their low efficiency these pumps are used in fast reactors because of their high reliability and low maintenance due to absence of moving parts. Besides, EM Pumps can be used for pumping impure sodium. IGCAR has developed electromagnetic pumps of various capacities and successfully used them in experimental facilities. This paper deals with the design, development and performance testing of a large electromagnetic pump called Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP). This 170 m 3 /h capacity ALIP is for use in PFBR Secondary Sodium Fill and <b>Drain</b> <b>Circuit</b> (SSFDC) and was introduced in the sodium circuit of SGTF for testing its performance. In this type of pump, a linearly traveling magnetic field is generated by means of circular windings placed spatially apart in slots and excited by 3 -phase supply. This traveling field induces circulating currents in liquid sodium which generates secondary magnetic field. Interaction of primary magnetic field and secondary magnetic field produces pumping force on liquid sodium. The pump duct is made of SS 316 L. Pump winding is made up of copper with class H insulation. The pump is designed for 360 V and for a maximum sodium temperature of 450 °C.

Therefore, the EE of BS would be less critical as compared to that in the users since mobile devices are typically hand-held devices with limited battery life and can quickly run out of battery.

The simulated plant {{is a typical}} 9 MWe CSP unit comprising 10 loops with 8 collectors in series (in turn {{this can be a}} “module” of a larger CSP solar field) a Two Tanks TES and a molten salt Steam Generator. This type of plant represents a challenge due to the large extension and relative complication of piping network operating with molten salt, in comparison to e. g. a molten salt Tower. The simulation model, implemented in Isaac Dynamics environment, is able to represent the normal operation of the plant with circulating HTF at variable mass flow depending on input DNI, and night circulation at reduced mass flow. In addition, in molten salt operated CSP plants draining operations are of prominent importance, given that these operations should be operated within a due time (depending on boundary conditions) avoiding the possible freezing of the salt mixture. Moreover also emergency draining (e. g. as a consequence of faults in the pump and/or in heat trace equipment) should be analyzed.

40|$|The „Small Change, Big Impact‟ {{project was}} {{implemented}} in a busy 14 bed haemodialysis unit. The organisation {{as a whole}} was looking at ways to reduce waste production throughout the hospital. It was found, by looking at a departmental level that the amount of clinical waste generated by a single haemodialysis treatment was substantial. While this waste production cannot be eliminated, there are measures that can be taken to substantially reduce the majority of this fluid prior to removing the used dialysis circuit from the dialysis machine. The dialysis machine has a function that enables the safe drainage of the blood contaminated fluid from the dialysis circuit prior to their disposal. This function does not incur any extra financial costs or require additional equipment to perform the task. By carrying out this simple action, it would result in the amount, in weight, of clinical waste leaving the unit reducing dramatically. The change was implemented over an 8 week period. Collaboration with all members of the team was important to maximise the potential for success in the change process. This was achieved by creating an interest and ownership in the change project from its inception. Current practice was observed prior to carrying out the project then 4 weeks after the initial intervention and then a further 4 weeks later. The involvement of the team was integral {{to the success of the}} change process. This was achieved through dissemination of instruction leaflets on how to drain the dialysis lines, ward meetings to gain feedback and answer questions and also provide audit results following the initial intervention.

40|$|The Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) {{method has}} been {{demonstrated}} {{to be capable of}} simulating the electromagnetic propagation in passive components of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), such as microstrip lines, air-bridges, and spiral inductors. The full simulation of MMICs by TLM is hindered by the lack of a GaAs MESFET model. Although SPICE-type lumped element models can be embedded, they are not sufficiently accurate to describe the time dependent response, and they defeat the method since TLM distinguishes itself by being capable of simulating physical structures. In addition, the TLM method cannot simulate a physics-based MESFET model since it cannot model fixed charges in the depletion region, nor can it model the highly non-linear field interactions in the conducting region. The TLM method requires a background solver to assist physics-based MESFET modelling. This thesis presents a novel method for enabling the TLM method to simulate the active region of the MESFET. The device is treated as a two-port where the depletion region is the input, and the channel region is the output. The input of the two-port is fed electric field signals from the gate transmission line. An internal GaAs MESFET solver transforms the input electric field into a voltage waveform, and the channel current and the depletion-channel boundary profile are calculated at every time instant by consideration of the channel doping and geometry. Via suitable interface parameters, the calculated outputs are transformed by individual TLM systems filling the channel into output electric and magnetic fields. The first part of the thesis derives a novel two-dimensional formulation of the TLM method enabling it to simulate a vertical section of the MESFET channel whose thickness is chosen small enough such that the electric field can be considered to be uniform. By controlling the TLM pulse energy, nodes conductivities, and section length, these three interface parameters enable the resultant TLM system to transform the physical characteristics of any infinitesimal section of the channel into electric and magnetic fields. The second part of the thesis derives a numerical time-domain quasi two-dimensional model of a GaAs MESFET with several novel aspects. Time-domain simulation is derived from non-stationary electron velocity response to the electric field. A new method is introduced, called the voltage balance method, to numerically solve the Poisson and current continuity equations at every time instant. In addition, a new time-domain treatment of the dielectric relaxation time constants of the <b>drain</b> and gate <b>circuits</b> enable the method to adopt variable time steps. When these three procedures are combined together, they result in a non-linear GaAs MESFET model which can offer sufficient accuracy and substantial time savings over other techniques. Several practical examples are presented showing TLM computations of (i) the non-stationary carrier velocity response to applied field, (ii) the transient field response to an application of biases into the MESFET, and (iii) the field response to an applied electric field sinusoidal waveform at 10 GHZ. The thesis concludes with several recommendations for future work. The key one is to link this work with the 3 -dimensional TLM method by augmenting the output channel fields with those computed by TLM for the passive field interactions in the MESFET source, gate, and drain electrodes...|$|R
