Still plagued by his injuries, and although considered to be a <b>good</b> <b>teacher,</b> he began drinking heavily and this eventually led to him being dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a <b>good</b> <b>teacher,</b> and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.|$|E
40|$|Many {{people still}} believe that <b>good</b> <b>{{teachers}}</b> are born and not made. Others believe that <b>good</b> <b>teachers</b> {{figure out how to}} teach in their own classrooms. We believe that <b>good</b> <b>teachers</b> can be born again in the digital world. The digital world gives teachers powerful, new ideas, strong con-tent, plentiful pedagogy, and connection to virtual schools in real-time. Furthermore the new kind of e-learning environment gives the teacher a new mission. The new kind of e-learning contributes to producing students who are strong thinkers and novel problem solvers. This paper introduces new learning tools based on cloud computing technologies. Furthermore we present innovative learning tools based on interactive e-learning environment...|$|R

25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a <b>good</b> <b>teacher.</b> This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Berry... was a <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> {{and focus}} for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the personal qualities of <b>good</b> <b>teachers</b> as identified by teachers, students and researchers, and to determine whether transformational leadership practices can help develop these desirable personal qualities in teachers.

The study also included aii review of research and literature concerning transformational leadership practices, principles and training methods.

2500|$|The {{importance}} {{of education and}} study is a fundamental theme of the Analects. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is someone older who {{is familiar with the}} ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (Analects 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (Analects 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the Analects as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (Analects 7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (Analects 3.8) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{aimed to}} provide each pupil with a textbook {{but the reality}} was a severe shortage of textbooks and other teaching materials. Consequently, teaching was usually [...] "talk and chalk" [...] with rote learning. Secondary schools may have a plasma television to receive the national curriculum in 60% of subjects but its success has been limited since it depends on electricity supply, <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> facilitation and supply of textbooks. School libraries tend to be under-stocked or stocked with inappropriate books from international donations. Plasma lessons are broadcast in English for 35 minutes from Addis Ababa. Standard lesson time is 45 minutes, leaving teachers with 10 minutes for an introduction and post-discussion. Transmission was too fast for many pupils {{to keep up with}} the English and there were no facilities to record and repeat the lesson so many failed to understand the lesson. Hence, only children from rich families, who had television at home and private tutors to supplement the lessons, could benefit from lessons delivered by plasma television. The remaining 90% were disadvantaged by plasma television lessons. This could be remedied by distributing plasma lessons on CDs/DVDs to be used as teaching aids for teacher/pupil discussion.|$|E
