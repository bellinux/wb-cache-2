40|$|The {{positive}} relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species richness is a cornerstone of ecology. Recently, {{it was suggested that}} this relationship should be unimodal rather than linear due to a tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and population sizes. Increased environmental heterogeneity will decrease effective habitat sizes, which in turn will increase the rate of local species extinctions. The occurrence of the unimodal richness–heterogeneity relationship at the habitat scale was confirmed in both empirical and theoretical studies. However, it is unclear whether it can occur at broader spatial scales, for meta-communities in diverse and patchy landscapes. Here, I used a spatially explicit meta-community model to quantify the roles of two species-level characteristics, niche width and <b>immigration</b> <b>rates,</b> on the type of the richness–heterogeneity relationship at the landscape scale. I found that both positive and unimodal richness–heterogeneity relationships can occur in meta-communities in patchy landscapes. The type of the relationship was affected by the interactions between inter-patch <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> and species’ niche widths. Unimodal relationships were prominent in meta-communities comprising species with wide niches but low inter-patch <b>immigration</b> <b>rates.</b> In contrast, meta-communities consisting of species with narrow niches and high <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> exhibited {{positive relationship}}s. Meta-communities comprising generalist species are therefore likely to exhibit unimodal richness-heterogeneity relationships as long as low <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> prevent rescue effects and patches are small. The richness-heterogeneity relationship at the landscape scale is dictated by species’ niche widths and inter-patch <b>immigration</b> <b>rates.</b> These <b>immigration</b> <b>rates,</b> in turn, depend on the interaction between species dispersal capabilities and habitat connectivity, highlighting the roles of both species traits and landscape structure in generating the richness–heterogeneity relationship at the landscape scale...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of colonization of a territory by a stochastic population at low immigration pressure. We assume a sufficiently strong Allee effect that introduces, in deterministic theory, a large critical population size for colonization. At low <b>immigration</b> <b>rates,</b> the average pre-colonization population size is small thus invalidating the WKB approximation to the master equation. We circumvent this difficulty by deriving an exact zero-flux solution of the master equation and matching it with an approximate non-zero-flux solution of the pertinent Fokker-Planck equation in a small region around the critical population size. This procedure provides an accurate evaluation of the quasi-stationary probability distribution of population sizes in the pre-colonization state, and of the mean time to colonization, {{for a wide range}} of <b>immigration</b> <b>rates.</b> At sufficiently high <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> our results agree with WKB results obtained previously.

25|$|Biogeography is most keenly {{observed}} on islands, {{which has led}} to the development of the subdiscipline of island biogeography. These habitats are often a more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. In 1967, Robert MacArthur and E.O.

This showed that the species richness in an area could be predicted in terms of factors such as habitat area, <b>immigration</b> <b>rate</b> and extinction rate. The theory is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory. The application of island biogeography theory to habitat fragments spurred the development of the fields of conservation biology and landscape ecology.|$|E

25|$|Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest <b>immigration</b> <b>rate</b> in {{percentage}} terms after Cyprus, {{but by a}} great margin, {{the highest}} in absolute numbers, up to 2008.

In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.|$|E

Exacerbating this issue is increasing urbanization that leaves vulnerable demographics isolated in more rural regions. To make meaningful statements {{about the future of}} Japan 2 ̆ 7 s demographic distribution, it is necessary to analyze population movement within the country. To this end, we perform a descriptive analysis examining the net <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> into each prefecture of Japan from other prefectures over the course of 2004 to 2013. In particular, we propose a Bayesian regression model of net <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> which incorporates eects of census variables, latent differences between prefectures, and anomalous shocks in wake of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent nuclear meltdown. We use two-component spike-and-slab priors on regression coefficients that allow for selective shrinkage of parameters. We further propose a framework for predicting from the model and demonstrate that it provides accurate predictions even for years for which covariate values are not known. Our model is seen to give robust predictions of <b>immigration</b> <b>rates,</b> while also yielding valuable insights about the potential factors influencing migration between regions of Japan...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{total amount}} of native {{vegetation}} is an important property of fragmented landscapes and is known to exert a strong influence on population and metapopulation dynamics. As the relationship between habitat loss and local patch and gap characteristics is strongly non-linear, theoretical models predict that <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> should decrease dramatically at low levels of remaining native vegetation cover, leading to patch-area effects {{and the existence of}} species extinction thresholds across fragmented landscapes with different proportions of remaining native vegetation. Although empirical patterns of species distribution and richness give support to these models, direct measurements of <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> across fragmented landscapes are still lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the Brazilian Atlantic forest marsupial Gray Slender Mouse Opossum (Marmosops incanus) as a model species and estimating demographic parameters of populations in patches situated in three landscapes differing in the {{total amount of}} remaining forest, we tested the hypotheses that patch-area effects on population density are apparent only at intermediate levels of forest cover, and that <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> into forest patches are defined primarily by landscape context surrounding patches. As expected, we observed a positive patch-area effect on M. incanus density only within the landscape with intermediate forest cover. Density was independent of patch size in the most forested landscape and the species was absent from the most deforested landscape. Specifically, the mean estimated numbers o...|$|R

40|$|Context: Early-season {{immigration}} into arable fields {{by natural}} enemies is key for effective biocontrol, but {{little is known}} about the mechanisms underlying immigration processes. Objectives: Here we test the mass action hypothesis for ballooning spiders, stating that local <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> are positively related to the amount of spiders in the surrounding landscape. Methods: <b>Immigration</b> <b>rates</b> of spiders were assessed by sticky traps in remnant vegetation, in arable land 25 – 125 m from remnant vegetation, and in arable land further than 400 m from remnant vegetation. The experiment was conducted at 18 locations across two landscapes and repeated three times in a 2 -week period in 2007 and 2008. Spider densities in crop and non-crop habitats were assessed by beat sheet sampling and used to calculate spider loads in landscape sectors around the experimental locations at five spatial scales. Results: Regression analysis indicated that <b>immigration</b> <b>rates</b> were influenced by meteorological variables and landscape context at 2 km and possibly beyond. Regression models that included spider load at relevant spatial scales received more statistical support from the data than models with the proportion of remnant vegetation and crops. Regression analysis further indicated that wheat and—to a lesser extent—remnant vegetation are important habitats for the recruitment of ballooning spiders. Conclusions: Our study provides support for the mass action hypothesis by showing that a combination of land-use variables with habitat specific spider densities allows the generation of functional cover types with greatly improved explanatory power. </p...|$|R
