Rivero eventually reached {{the rank of}} Full-Admiral (four-stars) and in October 1962, {{found himself in the}} middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, he was on the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire {{were on the}} <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic {{damage than}} other areas. Some {{of the costs of}} the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown's military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, behind the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had been {{replaced}} with velites, who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii.|$|E

5|$|In late 1939, the Southern Railway, {{until then}} {{primarily}} a high-density commuter railway serving London and South-East England, {{much of it}} electrified with third-rail pick-up, found itself on the British <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, with a severe lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of new Roman legion, the 900 triarii formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each, which were in turn part of 15 , larger units {{made up of a}} maniple of triarii, a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi. The triarii stood in the third line of the legion, behind the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> hastati and the second line of principes, and in front of the rorarii and accensi. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin-armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the VRS by about , {{capturing}} {{much of the}} Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces {{within striking distance of}} the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E

5|$|The fort's {{armament}} was revised {{several times}} during its seventy years of military usage, as its role evolved in the river's defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located {{to the south and}} east respectively on the Kent shore. Over time, as batteries and forts further downriver became the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and its fabric was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to be used against fast-moving surface and aerial targets. Its last military usage was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé dances seductively {{towards the}} men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, {{the first of}} which is a white evening gown as she grasps the chains of two chained hyenas. As the {{confrontation}} escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front {{of a small group of}} her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit of}} the {{commander}} of the Panzerjagdverbände (tank-hunting detachment) of Army Group Vistula, Oberst Ernst-Wilhelm Freiherr Gedult von Jungenfeld, all of the Panzerjagdverbände were to be centralized under Strachwitz' command. In April the Panzerjagdeinheiten (tank-hunting units) of Army Group Centre were all put under his command, this included Panzerjagdverbände A, B and C (Wehrkreis VIII), the Heeres-Panzerjagdbrigaden 1 and 3, two Volkssturm-Panzerjagdbrigaden and the Panzerjäger-Brigade Niederschlesien (Lower Silesia) and Free Ukrainians. Strachwitz deployed his men in small combat groups, sometimes operating behind Allied lines, which lured Soviet tanks into traps and attacked them with Panzerfausts. Combat reached its peak in April 1945, and some of his men were credited with more than ten enemy tanks destroyed each. The German <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Army Group Centre at the time was in mid-Silesia along the Zobten, and via Schweidnitz and Jauer to Lauban. The main Soviet thrust was towards Berlin and Dresden, threatening the German troops in Silesia with encirclement. Strachwitz and his men fought under the command of Schörner until the German capitulation on 8 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Player {{characters}} and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, {{at which point}} the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received. The player can choose whether characters appear on the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> a battle or in the back. A character's placement impacts damage received and inflicted {{depending on the type of}} attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison {{who oversaw the}} negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of the}} territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop a very basic road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was on the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|They {{departed}} {{earlier in}} the year than they had planned, owing to increased Union pressure. En route, they entered Baxter Springs, Kansas, the site of Fort Blair. They attacked the fort on October 6, but the 90 Union troops there quickly took refuge inside, suffering minimal losses. Shortly after the initial assault, a larger group of Union troops approached Fort Blair, unaware that the fort had been attacked and that the men they saw outside the fort dressed in Union uniforms were actually disguised guerrillas. The guerrillas charged the Union forces, killing about 100. Anderson and his men were {{in the rear of the}} charge, but gathered a large amount of plunder from the dead soldiers, irritating some guerrillas from the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the charge. Not satisfied with the number killed, Anderson and Todd wished to attack the fort again, but Quantrill considered another attack too risky. He angered Anderson by ordering his forces to withdraw.|$|E
