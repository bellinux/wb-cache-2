He hoped {{to work in a}} national park on the coast and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now known as the Ocean Institute), an organization in Dana Point, California that is dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. Hillenburg was a marine-biology teacher there for three years: [...] "We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures." [...] He stayed at the Dana Point Marina and was also a staff artist. Although [...] "t was a great experience" [...] for him, during this period, Hillenburg realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was {{originally}} intended for inclusion on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, the song's accompanying daytime video {{was used as}} part of Doritos Late Night Campaign. Jonas Åkerlund directed both daytime and nighttime versions for the song, which featured different colors and styles. The daytime video leaked onto the Internet on September 17, 2010, before it was given an official release. In a press statement given by Rihanna, the singer revealed how she was exited to work with Doritos on the project, saying: [...] "I'm really excited about 'Who's That Chick?' and {{wanted to find a}} fresh and unique way to share it with my fans... When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> cool the augmented reality performance Doritos created was, I knew this was it. This was the way I wanted to make 'Who's That Chick?' available to the world, and I can't wait to see how my fans get engaged in this innovative experience." ...|$|E

Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first American print {{reference}} to the [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] occurred when C.L. Sulzberger of The New York Times first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by Vladko Maček, a Croatian politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. Maček told Sulzberger, [...] "During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [...] so that nobody could know what went on behind it".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} assumed that the years Maugham spent {{studying}} medicine were a creative dead end, but Maugham did not feel this way about this time. He {{was living in the}} great city of London, meeting people of a [...] "low" [...] sort whom he would never have met otherwise, and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student: [...] "I saw how men died. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> they bore pain.

2500|$|In 1948, {{after the}} Second World War, Shute flew his own Percival Proctor light {{aeroplane}} to Australia and back, with the writer James Riddell. On his return home, {{concerned about the}} general decline in his home country, {{he decided that he}} and his family would emigrate and so, in 1950, he settled {{with his wife and two}} daughters on farmland at Langwarrin, south-east of Melbourne. In Slide Rule, quoting from the diary he kept during the R100's successful test flight to Canada, Shute had written in 1930, [...] "I would never have believed after a fortnight's stay I should be so sorry to leave a country." [...] In 1954 he introduced that quote, [...] "For the first time in my life <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> people live in an English-speaking country outside England," [...] and said it was interesting in the light of his later decision to emigrate to Australia. Although he intended to remain in Australia, he did not take out Australian citizenship, but at that time it would have been an unnecessary formality as he would have had the same rights as an Australian citizen because he was a British subject.|$|E

2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
