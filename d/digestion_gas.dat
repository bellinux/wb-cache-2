Internal mixing being uneconomical in the domestic and individual scale, it is not being practiced which has to be compensated with large hydraulic retention time to prevent sludge accumulation and scum formation. This in turn reduces the plant capacity for gas production. Our design configuration incorporates automatic and controlled pressure swing mechanisms incorporated by the gas production which acts as the driving force for slurry circulation in the digester and promotes gas recovery as well as improve digestion efficiency. The configuration was run in 20 l and 50 L scales and observed for the physical constraints encountered during operation, recorded for change in digestion parameters with changes in substrate and organic loading rates and also recorded the gas production which was compared with the results in the literature as well as conventionally operated domestic scale digesters...|$|E

40|$|Biogas {{production}} through {{anaerobic digestion}} may {{play an important}} role in a circular economy because of the opportunity to produce a renewable fuel from organic waste. However, the production of biogas may require energy in the form of heat and electricity. Therefore, resource-effective biogas production must consider both biological and energy performance. For the individual biogas plant to improve its energy performance, a robust methodology to analyse and evaluate the energy demand on a detailed level is needed. Moreover, to compare the energy performance of different biogas plants, a methodology with a consistent terminology, system boundary and procedure is vital. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for analysing the energy demand in biogas plants on a detailed level. In the methodology, the energy carriers are allocated to: (1) sub-processes (e. g., pretreatment, anaerobic <b>digestion,</b> <b>gas</b> cleaning), (2) unit processes (e. g., heating, mixing, pumping, lighting) and (3) a combination of these. For a thorough energy analysis, a combination of allocations is recommended. The methodology was validated by applying it to two different biogas plants.

The produced biogas can then be used for cogeneration, electricity, heat or upgraded to vehicle gas. Eskilstuna Energy & Environment AB has four digesters at Ekeby water sewage treatment plant, Eskilstuna. One of the biogas reactor (RK 4) {{is equipped with a}} jet-mixing system while the remaining digester uses top-mixing. The mixing system is an important parameter to achieve optimum operating conditions for the process regarding gas production and degree of digestion. This study aims to evaluate the two mixing systems, jet-mixing and top- mixing. The design of the reactors is identical and they are assumed to be fed with the same amount of substrate. By collection, analysis and compiling of process- and operational data such as gas production, degree of digestion and energy consumption for the two different systems their performance has been compared to each other. Different operational conditions considering the energy consumption for the jet-mixing system has been done theoretical to try to reduce the energy consumption. The result shows that both rectors operates under stable process conditions, although the result indicates that the gas production for the reactor installed with jet-mixing system is greater than the system with top-mixing system.

Integrated biogas fuel cell plants in wastewater treatment plants and other bioenergy recovery plants are nowadays on the verge of becoming a clear opportunity for the market entry of high-temperature fuel cells in distributed generation (power production from a few kW to the MW scale). High-temperature fuel cell technologies like molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are especially fit to operate with carbon fuels due to their (direct or indirect) internal reforming capability. Especially, systems based on SOFC technology show the highest conversion efficiency of gaseous carbon fuels (e. g., natural gas, digester gas, and biomass-derived syngas) into electricity when compared to engines or gas turbines. Also, lower CO 2 emissions and ultra-low emissions of atmospheric contaminants (SOX, CO, VOC, especially NOX) are generated per unit of electricity output. Nonetheless, stringent requirements apply regarding fuel purity. The presence of contaminants within the anode fuel stream, even at trace levels (sometimes ppb levels) can reduce the lifetime of key components like the fuel cell stack and reformer. In this work, we review the complex matrix (typology and amount) of different contaminants that is found in different biogas types (anaerobic <b>digestion</b> <b>gas</b> and landfill gas). We analyze the impact of contaminants on the fuel reformer and the SOFC stack to identify the threshold limits of the fuel cell system towards specific contaminants.

We hypothesize that colobines are more constrained in their resting position than hindgut fermenting primates and that colobines assume a sitting resting position for specific reasons.

First, we observed resting positions in two captive individuals each of eight species and tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Second, we collected literature data on free-ranging specimens of 31 species and again tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Both approaches indicated that colobines spent more time in a sitting posture than other primates (73. 0 % vs. 23. 2 % in captivity and 83. 0 % vs. 60. 9 % in the wild, respectively).

The purpose of this work was undertaken to know the meaning of BOD_ 5 and COD for night-soil treatment. Batch-type method which is one of the most common laboratory digestion treatment was employed during this experiment. As for the digestion treatment, anaerobic (simple static <b>digestion,</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation and mechanical screw stirring) and aerobic treatment were employed and these treatments were operated simultaneously making the comparision of digestive efficiency between these treatments. When anaerobic and aerobic treatment are compared, the values of BOD_ 5, valatile acids and organic substances expressed as albuminoid nitrogen varied largely. Especially, the values of these indices decreased largely in aerobic treatment. In anaerobic treatment, lower molecularization apparently occurred in primary stage, as a result of biological decomposition of organic matter. This fact was comfirmed by the accumulated data using the running water dialysis with Cellophane bag. BOD_ 5 was sensitive against low molecular organic substances expressed as volatile acids and albuminoid nitrogen, and the values of BOD_ 5 of dialytic or supanatant was correlative to volatile acids concentration and substances expressed as albuminoid nitrogen regarding the rate of dialysis and remaining percentage of each index of both treatments.

However, there are smaller, less efficient wastewater treatment plants still in use in Singapore. One of those is located in the Kranji Catchment region adjacent to the Lim Chu Kang Air Force Base. Called BJ 725, this facility consists of a primary settler and a trickling filter. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using wind power, solar power, or methane gas combustion to meet the treatment facility's energy requirement. As the first part of this feasibility study, BJ 725 's energy requirement was analyzed. Additionally, wind and solar output was computed given historical meteorological conditions in Singapore, and the amount of power produced during methane gas combustion was computed given sludge output at BJ 725. The outcome of these calculations showed mixed results. There was not one day of wind strong enough to produce usable energy in the 33 -year meteorological dataset analyzed. Thus, there is essentially no potential for wind energy to be used in Singapore. Solar energy proved to be economically viable, but only with at least a 63 percent rebate.

The starting hydrogen ion concentrations (pH) of the slurries used in the study were, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Two digestion temperatures; 30 and 35 o C were used during this investigation. The result of the anaerobic digestion indicate that slurries with starting pH 5, recorded highest cumulative gas yield of 3650 ml for slurry with 15 % SC, digested at 30 o C. Slurries with pH 6 recorded highest cumulative gas yield of 2880 ml for slurry with 20 % SC, digested at 35 o C. Slurries with pH 7 had 3945 ml highest cumulative gas yield observed in slurry with 15 % SC, digested at 35 o C. Highest cumulative gas yields for pH 8 and 9 were 4635 ml and 4730 ml respectively, recorded for slurries with 25 % SC digested at 35 o C. For both <b>digestion</b> temperatures, <b>gas</b> yield tend to increase with solids concentration, however, highest gas yield was observed at 35 o C, and slurries with starting pH of 7 gave relatively consistent high gas yields...|$|R

In this work, the biodiesel processing waste (BDW) at different portions of 0. 5 - 3. 0 % (v/v) in feed was subsequently added to an anaerobic hybrid reactor (AHR) treating cassava wastewater (CSW). Enhanced gases production, optimum dosage, digester’s performance and stability of each co-digestion conditions were evaluated. The results obtained clearly demonstrated the possible co-digestion of these wastes which increased gases production if BDW did not exceed 2. 0 %. The supplementation of BDW at 0. 5 - 2. 0 % can increase 19. 4 - 96. 2 % and 13. 4 - 56. 7 % for biogas and methane production, respectively. These daily productions of biogas and methane were 12. 6, 13. 8, 15. 5, 20. 7, 18. 8, 16. 4 L-biogas/d and 8. 6, 9. 4, 10. 3, 13. 2, 11. 0, 7. 7 L-CH 4 /d for 0. 5 - 3. 0 % BDW addition, compared to 10. 6 L-biogas/d and 7. 2 L- CH 4 /d of single CSW <b>digestion.</b> Similar <b>gases</b> yields (0. 45 - 0. 51 L-biogas/gCODremoved and 0. 30 - 0. 33 L-CH 4 / gCODremoved) and stable performance of AHR were maintained at 0. 5 - 2. 0 % additions. The optimal dosage which promoted the maximum production was suggested to be 2. 0 %. Higher BDW dosage was claimed as the limitation. An imbalance digestion was observed as depicted as drop of pH, lower methane composition, and acid accumulation at particularly 3. 0 % of BDW supplementation.

40|$|Waste is {{unwanted}} or useless {{materials from}} households, industry, agriculture, hospitals. Waste materials in solid state {{are classified as}} solid waste. Increasing {{of the amount of}} solid waste and the pressure what it has on the environment, impose the need to introduce sustainable solid waste management. Advanced sustainable solid waste management involves several activities at a higher level of final disposal of the waste management hierarchy. Minimal use of material and energy resources contributes to reduce the quantity of generated waste. Reducing of the quantities of solid waste has been achieved by re-use of products for the same or another purpose and by using technologies for material and energy utilization. Technologies for material utilization of solid waste, which are at the third place in waste management hierarchy, are recycling and composting. Technologies for energy utilization of solid waste are divided in two groups: -	Thermochemical processes: insineration, pyrolysis and gasification -	Biochemical processes: anaerobic <b>digestion</b> and landfill <b>gas.</b> The solid waste that can not be use for recycling or re-use, should be dispose of appropriate places called landfills. ...|$|R
