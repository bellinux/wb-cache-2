40|$|Higher {{frequency}} {{has been}} shown to {{have a positive effect on}} the acquisition of words and other linguistic items in children. An important question that needs to be answered then is how children learn low frequency items. In this study, we investigate the acquisition of meanings for low frequency words through computational modeling. We suggest that for such words, the familiarity of the context they appear in has an important effect on their acquisition. We note that context <b>familiarity</b> <b>is</b> confounded with <b>another</b> <b>factor,</b> namely the age of exposure to a word, and hence examine the independent role of each of the two factors on word learning. Cross-situational Word Learning Learning the meaning of words is a challenging task for young children, especially given that most words are learne...|$|R
