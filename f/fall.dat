5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an ash <b>fall</b> event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash <b>fall,</b> reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash <b>fall</b> events.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and <b>fall</b> over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually <b>fall</b> over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would <b>fall</b> over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
