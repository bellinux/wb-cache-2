500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E
2500|$|Boehner told The Washington Post that {{he learned}} of the {{inappropriate}} contact in the spring. Boehner initially said that he informed Hastert, and that Hastert assured him [...] "we're taking care of it." [...] After Hastert denied knowledge of this conversation, Boehner retracted, saying {{that he could not}} recall it. On October 3, Boehner once again recanted, this time telling a radio interviewer [...] "I believe I talked to the Speaker and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> had been taken care of." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after he}} turned 18, Garðar {{decided he wanted}} to be a singer. [...] "I loved acting but I {{realised}} I couldn't live without music. What decided me was the amount of times I have cried over a phrase in an opera or the piano. In opera you can combine the two and, apart from Domingo, there aren't that many singers who are good actors." [...] He spent four years at his father's school in Reykjavík and then won a scholarship to the , or University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna, but left after six months to study privately with Professor Andrei Orlowitz in Copenhagen. For the next five years he spent two weeks in Denmark, then flew home to earn enough to pay the tuition and the airfares. He sang at funerals and weddings, appeared as Tony in West Side Story at the National Theatre in Reykjavík in 1995, and for five summers worked with disabled people. At the opera he was the toilet cleaner, the usher and the doorman. Recalling his father's advice about the hardships of a musical career, Garðar has commented: [...] "Even though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was difficult, I still wanted to pursue this road. But looking back, you realise he was right, it is bloody difficult! Excuse the language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He was startled. And so was I after <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It’s</b> {{a search}} party. They are {{out looking for}} a man. Willie’s soft heart’s enlisted in the cause.” ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Johnnie! There {{were tears}} in his eyes when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>it,</b> three years afterwards.|$|R
60|$|Bill promised 'im like a shot, {{and when}} <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>it</b> <b>'e</b> was nearly crying with joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{suffering}} from {{a cut in the}} head. A Spaniard had kicked him--and, yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was a Spaniard that you and he were after for having robbed a bank of some money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moon?" [...] Teenie repeated. [...] "Why, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was a skull, with {{a dagger}} {{underneath}} it and with bones on the sides, same's pirates {{have on their}} flags; an' the two coffins was for you an' the other feller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Then {{he wanted}} to show me his {{bachelor}} apartment on Liberty street. He's got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> cost him $18,000 to furnish his apartment, and I believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday {{morning in}} Bond-street, {{just before we}} left town, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of <b>it</b> directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But as you say, <b>it</b> is said. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>it,</b> {{not long}} afterwards, and I {{do not think}} he would have dared had there been anything--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went to work}} in {{the right}} way, sir! <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> looked into it. And that paint is a thing that will bear looking into." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't eat anything. I've {{been walking}} about, {{waiting for the}} damned hours to pass. I wish I hadn't promised father not to go into court. Anything {{would have been better}} than this awful suspense. I saw the man who's {{defending}} him when they adjourned for luncheon, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] {{explained}} her companion, [...] "likes to have {{a number}} of different things in hand. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was wiser, when I said that I couldn't tell my friends back East what he really is, because he seemed to be everything at once. But your brother's interested in a good many things, too, isn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{made the}} venture, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> was last night I sent the men out, and the cazadores only started this morning. Morales blundered then, {{but it is}} rather more than likely he couldn’t help himself. Nobody would call him timid, but just now {{it would have been}} a risky thing for him to go back to Santa Marta alone.” ...|$|E
60|$|Again, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> {{has become}} the custom in large {{businesses}} of which the dividends are falling, {{to put in a}} man called an 'Organizer,' who is often an American.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} very much pleased," [...] she continued. [...] "We have little money and father is not very strong. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> had taken a weight off his mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Grace, [...] "Mr. Touchett {{was talking}} {{of getting the}} choir master from Avoncester, and giving up an {{afternoon}} to practice for Easter, but <b>he</b> never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was to be to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About Jane Fairfax. Did {{you ever}} hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself. I met him just now. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> {{was to be a}} great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of {{mentioning}} it to any body but you, but he said you knew it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I met him; and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> {{was the old}} story: a gal was at {{the bottom}} of it. He had broken into a small house at Hampstead. He was on the floor, packing up the silver, when the door opens, and he sees a gal {{standing}} there. She held a candle {{in one hand and a}} revolver in the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{never felt}} so happy in my life. I'd waited over an hour on that landing of theirs, and then Johnny Miller came along, and I yelled in his ear that I was after work, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would be all right. He's awfully good to girls who've worked in shows for him before. If it hadn't been for him I might have been waiting there still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>it</b> made <b>me</b> very angry," [...] said Betty, {{raising her}} head. There {{was a bright}} red spot in each cheek. [...] "You--you seemed to think you--that I--well--I did not like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no. I left Parker in charge. It {{was up to}} him to do {{what was}} wanted. Say, Prince, I {{want to talk to you}} about that guy, Parker. I {{understand}} he's been rather rough with you and your crowd. That wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about <b>it</b> till <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It's</b> the darned Wild West strain in him coming out. He used to do those sort of things out there, and he's forgotten his manners. I pay him well, and I guess he thinks that's the way it's up to him to earn it. You mustn't mind Parker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suit yourself, lass," [...] replied Mrs. Andrews, kindly. [...] "I {{know you}} and Wils quarreled, for <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> An' <b>it's</b> a pity.... Wal, {{if you must}} go, I hope you'll come again before the snow flies. Good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{me that it}} an't worth picking up," [...] {{replied the}} trapper, {{fingering}} the shining particles. [...] "Leastwise I once collected a bag o' the same an' showed it {{to a man in}} the settlements who got the credit o' bein' a knowin' fellow in regard to metals. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was somethin' that I don't remember the name of, but worth nothing, so I heaved it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> {{may be all}} a fiction. He {{married a}} girl bred in the country, I think, and, being an honourable, chivalrous soul, {{told me that he}} repented his bargain and sent her to her as often as {{possible}} a person who has lived in the Doon since the memory of man and goes to Mussoorie when other people go Home. The wife is with her at present. So he says.' ...|$|E
60|$|When we had amused {{ourselves}} a while about this, I said to him: 'Well, you shall go {{away from me}} no more; I'll go {{all over the world}} with you rather.' <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me, but since it must be, he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I could; but as for him, it would be his destruction that he foresaw.|$|E
60|$|FANNY. He didn't WANT a {{woman of}} his own class. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. <b>It</b> was because I wasn't a colourless, {{conventional}} puppet with a book of etiquette {{in place of a}} soul that he was first drawn towards me.|$|R
6000|$|Near {{the end of}} 1889 {{among the}} {{visitors}} to Hawarden was Mr. Parnell. His air of good breeding and easy composure pleased everybody. Mr. Gladstone’s own record is simple enough, and contains {{the substance of the}} affair as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of <b>it</b> later:— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is hard to}} say. There are men who by {{no means}} wear their hearts upon their sleeves, and my husband is one of them. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> would be unbecoming in him to refuse, {{and that was all}} he said to me about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leslie laughed ironically. [...] "I {{have a few}} ideas. Milligan--we had {{him over}} at dinner once--made {{a good deal of}} money that way, and from what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> doesn't seem very {{different}} from the business I have been engaged in. Success evidently depends upon one's ability to sell the confiding investor what he thinks he'd like to get. Somehow I fancy that, with moderately good luck, two or three years of it should set us on our feet." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was a grievous Subject, {{and a long}} one, and {{too long}} to rehearse, but he {{would give me a}} short Abridgment of it; and not to look back into his Wars, in which he was abominably ill serv'd, his {{subjects}} constantly ill treated him in giving him Supplies too late, that he cou'd not get into the Field, nor forward his Preparations in time to be ready for his Enemies, who frequently were ready to insult him in his Quarters.|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} less by Degrees than Our Terrestial Globe, but more Land and less Water; and as I was {{particularly}} concern'd {{to see something}} {{in or near the}} same Climate with Our selves, I observ'd a large extended Country to the North, about the Latitude of 50 to 56 Northern Distance; and enquiring of that Country, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> {{was one of the best}} Countries in all their World: That it was his Native Climate, and he was just a going to it, and would take me with him.|$|E
60|$|In vain Warden Atherton {{tried to}} break my spirit. And there were times, beyond any shadow of doubt, when {{he would have been}} glad had I died in the jacket. So the long inquisition went on. As <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> repeatedly, <b>it</b> was {{dynamite}} or curtains.|$|R
6000|$|The priest {{shook his}} head gently. [...] "He refused to confess. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{distinctly}} that <b>it</b> was as man to man he spoke to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|N.B.--This {{dialogue}} between Will Atkins and his wife, which I took down in writing just after <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>me,</b> was as follows:-- ...|$|R
