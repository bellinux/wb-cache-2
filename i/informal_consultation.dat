25|$|The site {{selected}} by GSA on January 3, 1963, {{for the new}} FBI headquarters were two city blocks bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 9th Street NW, E Street NW, and 10th Street NW. GSA administrator Bernard Boutin said the site was selected after <b>informal</b> <b>consultation</b> with the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC; which had statutory power to approve any major construction in the D.C. metropolitan area). Boutin said construction of the new FBI building would help revitalize the Pennsylvania Avenue area as suggested by both the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space and the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue. Boutin emphasized that {{the design of the}} new structure would be in harmony with other buildings planned by the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue, and would necessitate the closing of a short section of D Street NW between 9th and 10th Streets NW. More than 100 small retail businesses were to be evicted.|$|E

50|$|Co-operation in {{international}} trade negotiations, under the Common Commercial Policy, {{dates back to the}} establishment of the community in 1957. The CFSP itself has its origins in the formation of European Political Co-operation (EPC) in 1970. European Political Co-operation was an <b>informal</b> <b>consultation</b> process between member states on foreign policy matters, with the aim of creating a common approach to foreign policy issues and promoting both the EC's own interests and those of the international community as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.|$|E

5000|$|Whatever {{about the}} wisdom of Kerr's {{decision}} to withdraw the commission of Whitlam, the lack of security of tenure meant that he had little room for prior consultation with Whitlam without raising the danger that he himself would be dismissed to halt any planned intervention. That fundamental design flaw forced an extreme solution of sorts on the crisis, whereas, protected by security of tenure, other heads of state would have had the option of <b>informal</b> <b>consultation,</b> even to the extent of warning the head of government that if the head of government persisted with a particular course of action, the head of state would have to intervene using the constitutional powers.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} a {{resolution}} reaches the Security Council Chamber, {{it has already been}} discussed, debated, and amended in the consultations. The open meeting of the Security Council has become a public ratification of a decision that has already been reached in private. A permanent member can cast a [...] "pocket veto" [...] during the <b>informal</b> <b>consultation</b> by declaring its opposition to a measure. Since a veto would prevent the resolution from being passed, the sponsor will usually refrain from putting the resolution to a vote. Resolutions are only vetoed if the sponsor feels so strongly about a measure that it wishes to force the permanent member to cast a formal veto.|$|E
50|$|In {{such systems}} unwritten (and unenforceable) {{constitutional}} conventions often outline {{the order in}} which people are asked to form a government. If the prime minister resigns after a general election, the monarch usually asks the leader of the opposition to form a government. Where however a resignation occurs during a parliament session (unless the government has itself collapsed) the monarch will ask another member of the government to form a government. While previously the monarch had some leeway in whom to ask, all British political parties now elect their leaders (until 1965 the Conservatives chose their leader by <b>informal</b> <b>consultation).</b> The last time the monarch had a choice over the appointment occurred in 1963 when the Earl of Home was asked to become Prime Minister ahead of Rab Butler.|$|E
50|$|When the six colonies federated to {{form the}} Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, there were some {{suggestions}} that the position of state governor should be abolished or that its appointment {{be made by the}} Governor-General as was (and still is) done in Canada. However, the states insisted on retaining their separate links to the Crown, a concept that can be compared to the American system of separate sovereignty for state and federal governments. The states were concerned that Commonwealth-appointed governors might be used to do the federal government's bidding, up to and including use of a Governor's reserve powers to dismiss a recalcitrant state government. To ensure that state governments would be free from such extra-constitutional intervention or coercion, state governors continued to be appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Colonial Secretary in London, usually after an <b>informal</b> <b>consultation</b> with the state government.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>informal</b> <b>consultations</b> {{started in}} late April, the main {{negotiations}} between the Soviet Union, Britain and France began in May.

Arria later became Special Advisor to Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UN, He initiated the eponymous 'Arria formula' a very <b>informal</b> <b>consultation</b> process which affords members of the Security Council the opportunity to hear persons in a confidential, informal setting.
