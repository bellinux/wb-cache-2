50|$|Geolibertarians {{generally}} support redistributing {{land rent}} from private landholders to all community members {{by way of}} a land value tax, as proposed by Henry George and others before him. As libertarians, geolibertarians desire to see the revenue from land value capture cover only necessary administrative costs and fund only those public services which are essential for a governing body to secure and <b>enforce</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> life, liberty and estate—civic protections which increase the aggregate land rent within the jurisdiction, and thereby serve to finance themselves—the surplus being equally distributed as an unconditional dividend to each citizen. Thus, the value of the land is returned to the residents who produce it, but who by practical necessity and legal privilege have been deprived of equal access, while the poor and disadvantaged benefit from a reliable social safety net unencumbered by bureaucracy or intrusive means-testing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the assertion that}} current rangeland management in the central Eastern Cape Province (former Ciskei) of South Africa, is characterised primarily by an ‘open access’ approach. Empirical material drawn from three case-study communities {{in the region is}} used to examine the main barriers to management of rangeland as a ‘commons’. The general inability to define and <b>enforce</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> particular grazing resourses in the face of competing claims from ‘outsiders’, as well as inadequate local institutions responsible for rangeland management are highlighted as being of key importance. These are often exacerbated by lack of available grazing land, diffuse user groups and local political and ethnic divisions. Many of these problems have a strong legacy in historical apartheid policies such as forced resettlement and betterment planning. On this basis it is argued that policy should focus on facilitating the emergence of effective, local institutions for rangeland management. Given the limited grazing available to many communities in the region, a critical aspect of this will be finding ways to legitimise current patterns of extensive resource use, which traverse existing ‘community’ boundaries. However, this runs counter to recent legislation, which strongly links community management with legal ownership of land within strict boundaries often defined through fencing. Finding ways to overcome this apparent disjuncture between theory and policy will be vital for the effective management of common pool grazing resources in the region...|$|E

50|$|In {{regard to}} labor, {{economic}} rent {{can be created}} by the existence of guilds or labor unions (e.g., higher pay for workers, where political action creates a scarcity of such workers).

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of realising Coasean bargains to remove the presence of externalities in a libertarian system of exclusive spectrum rights {{through the creation of}} various economically motivated easements. We advocate that dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques can be used <b>to</b> enable <b>rights</b> holders reduce or eliminate the effects of externalities through local bargaining. Many of the objections to the promotion of market-based exclusive-rights assignment systems concern the ability of <b>rights</b> holders <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> their spectrum <b>rights,</b> so as <b>to</b> extract maximal value. In an increasingly fragmented and less-regulated spectrum landscape, there will be an inevitable chafing of rights at the boundaries between the users of neighbouring blocks of spectrum; the spectral activities of one network may impinge on the ability of a neighbouring network to extract maximum value from its exclusively assigned spectrum. Nonetheless, it is argued {{that it is possible to}} reduce, or eliminate, the existence of such externalities through the adjustment and exchange of rights through value-extraction-focussed bargaining. In essence, this represents a shift from a mindset of unilaterally <b>enforcing</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> one of mutual remediation of any encroachment. Such an approach may offer a non-Pigouvian remedy to both the under-utilisation and over-utilisation of packages of exclusive <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> spectrum, allowing neighbours to find a tolerable level (a balance) of interference. This paper posits that DSA techniques will have a key role to play in the development of new DSA-based Coasean bargains which will be necessary to address a variety of coexistence issues that will arise between systems operating in neighbouring blocks of exclusively assigned spectrum...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{conflicts}} {{in the use of}} forests can be seen as an issue of resource allocation. An analytical framework is adapted from existing literature in property rights and public choice theory to examine and explain this situation. This approach stresses that the root cause of conflicts is due to forests being multi-functional with some non-complementary uses; and that the signalling of information and incentives are incomplete to coordinate or allocate the use of the various forest functions in a manner that considers the concerns of all interested groups. This arises {{because of a lack of}} comprehensive specification (definition and enforcement) of property rights. If property rights have been well defined (<b>right</b> <b>to</b> use, <b>right</b> <b>to</b> fransfer, <b>right</b> <b>to</b> exclude, and <b>right</b> <b>to</b> appropriate income) and enforced for each forest function, then information on the value of each function and the incentive to consider the impact of the use of a particular forest function on other functions will be signalled to guide the overall allocation of forests. However, there are barriers to the complete specification of rights. These lie in the costs of defining, monitoring, and <b>enforcing</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> each forest function, and of penalising offenders who violate these rights. Costs arise due to the inherent characteristics of the forest function (non-excludability and nonrivalry) and may make complete specification infeasible due to the trade-off between greater specification and higher costs. Nevertheless, there have been instances when rights were not defined and enforced even when specification costs were low; this then leads to an examination of the political choices made by the state. In these situations, political costs of defining and <b>enforcing</b> property <b>rights</b> need <b>to</b> be identified: there is a need to scrutinise the incentives faced and the economic rationality behind decisions made by the state in adopting a certain stance in the specification of rights. The state makes decisions by considering political benefits against costs (which may be generated from the various interest groups' reaction and loss of patronage support). In turn, collective action from the various interest groups to lobby for modifications in rights specification is spurred by changes in its benefit-cost calculus emanating from shifts in the value of the forest function in question...|$|R
