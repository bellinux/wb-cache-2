CDO Issuers often enter TRS agreements as protection seller in order to leverage the returns for the structure's debt investors. By selling protection, the CDO gains exposure to the underlying asset(s) without having to put up capital to purchase the assets outright. The CDO gains the <b>interest</b> <b>receivable</b> on the reference asset(s) over the period while the counterparty mitigates their market risk.|$|E

All the lending units borrow the funds from the central office at a particular rate and lend the same to the borrowers at a higher rate. The central office rate is notional in nature and is aligned to market conditions. Thus for all the units there are two rates available to measure the performance. For a deposit-raising unit the difference between interest paid to the deposit-holders and <b>interest</b> <b>receivable</b> from central office is the contribution to the bank's profitability. For a lending division the difference between Interest payable to central office and the interest received from the borrowers is the contribution to the bank's performance.|$|E
40|$|A sale of {{real estate}} is financed by the seller, and the buyer's initial {{investment}} is not sufficient for recognition of profit under the full accrual method. The seller meets the conditions of Statement 66 to record a sale and recognizes profit on the installment or cost recovery methods. Subsequently, the buyer defaults on the mortgage to the seller, and the seller forecloses on the property. At the time of foreclosure, fair value of the property is less than the seller's gross receivable but greater than the seller's net receivable, that is, the principal and <b>interest</b> <b>receivable</b> less the deferred profit on the sale and related allowances. The issue is the amount at which the foreclosed property should be recorded. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the foreclosed property should be recorded at the lower of the net amount of the receivable or fair value of the property. [Note: This consensus has been partially nullified by Statement 144. See STATUS section. ] Task Force members emphasized that the consensus, to the extent it defines net receivable, assumes that the accrual of interest income on the financing, if any, is appropriate under the circumstances.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 28). Internship {{is an integral part}} of BBA program. The objective of this program is to expose the students to organizational work environment. I got an opportunity to go through such a program. I was assigned to work as an intern in Janata Bank Limited- Mohammadpur Corporate Branch. The report is on “An enquiry into the financial feasibility of Janata Bank Limited, Mohammadpur Corporate Office”. The 1 st part of this report is concerned with my overall experience with this branch. The 2 nd part stands for the analysis. My focus was to answer how the branch is generating as well as increasing profit. Being a bank, it is supposed to do so by concentrating on banking activities. Non-banking activities are not considered to be avoided but the bank should not pay more attention to it than its core banking activities. The data represents year 2012, 2013 and 2014. Initially in 2012, total income consisted of more portion generated by banking activities. It was 53 %. After that, the total income has been made more from profit generated by non-banking activities. In my analysis part, I have taken the weighted average <b>interest</b> <b>receivables</b> on loans and weighted average interest payables on deposits. It is evident that, this branch takes on more deposits than it gives loans. For example, in the last year, total deposits taken were Tk. 235. 21. 66, 971 and total loans made were only Tk. 61, 82, 09, 510. However, the interest spreads were positive. Interests paid on deposits hold the largest portion of expenses. In my analysis, Midterm loans hold the highest portion for <b>interest</b> <b>receivables</b> (58 %- 92 %). Similarly, Weighted Average Interest payables for Midterm deposits are the largest. Midterm deposits have greater weights every year. After all the analysis, it can be said that, this branch is profitable but since 2012, it has been increasing it’s profit through non banking activities. It has been more focused on the wholesale funding. The reasons behind such attempt could be lacking of creditworthy client, interest in easy money making without default risk etc. Erham Ebne Abdur RahmanB. Business Administratio...|$|R

40|$|Legal systems {{around the}} world vary widely in how they deal with the {{assignment}} of receivables. This legal variety {{makes it difficult for}} financiers to conduct their international receivables financing business. This thesis suggests an International Registration System for the Assignment and Security <b>Interest</b> of <b>Receivables</b> (‘IRSAR’) and proposes a model international convention for the IRSAR (‘proposed IRSAR Convention’), which could help financiers to overcome the obstacles they currently encounter. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, the international assignment of receivables would be regulated by a unified legal system with respect to priority and perfection. The IRSAR would facilitate international project financing. Furthermore, the IRSAR would enable companies to raise finance from greater ranges of investors {{around the world}} through international receivables financing and to dispose of non-performing loans more easily. The proposed IRSAR Convention would succeed the UN Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade in the attempt of establishing a registration system for international assignments of receivables. The proposed IRSAR Convention confines its scope of application by defining the assignor (or the security provider), inventing the concept of ‘Vehicle for the International Registration System’ (‘VIRS’). The proposed IRSAR Convention applies where the assignor or security provider is a VIRS. An assignment of a receivable where the assignor is a VIRS and a security <b>interest</b> in a <b>receivable</b> where the security provider is a VIRS could be registered in the IRSAR. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, priority of assignments of and security <b>interests</b> in <b>receivables</b> is determined by the order of registration in the IRSAR. The proposed IRSAR Convention would be a receivables version of the Cape Town Convention. With respect to the contents and effect of registration, it would prescribe a notice-filing system along the lines of that adopted in the UCC Article 9. With respect to the operation of the registration, it would adopt an automatic online registration system operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year like the International Registry under the Cape Town Convention.

We find that trade arrears, <b>interest</b> burden and <b>receivables</b> cash conversion cycle are the most frequent determinants of default both at short term and long term horizon. We also develop two separate default models for large firms and foreign trade firms. We determine a measure of risk to financial stability – debt at risk – via the direct channel, by multiplying the estimated probability of default with the outstanding bank loans. Debt at risk is concentrated into above average risk firms, but risks to financial stability stemming from the real sector remain at a moderate level. Finally we propose some guidelines on how to build stress-testing scenarios that enables to analyze the impact of various macroeconomic shocks on the probabilities of default. We find that non-financial firms are resilient to potential interest rate shocks, {{which is consistent with}} the fact that firms finance their activity through bank loans only to a small extent.

40|$|There are two {{principal}} {{ways in which}} a firm that is owed money payable in the future but needs the money now may use its rights to payment (“receivables”) to obtain the needed financing. It might sell its receivables, or it might borrow and use the receivables as collateral to secure the loan. Different legal consequences follow {{depending on whether the}} transaction is a true sale or is a security interest that secures an obligation (a “SISO”). These legal consequences are particularly salient when the firm enters bankruptcy. If the transaction is a sale, then the buyer can collect the receivables as if no bankruptcy had ensued. If, however, the transaction is a SISO, then the receivables can be used by the firm during the bankruptcy and cannot be collected by the secured party unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise. The bankruptcy consequences of the distinction between a true sale and a SISO form the cornerstone of securitization transactions. If the firm enters bankruptcy, creditors have an incentive to argue that a transaction that is structured and documented as a true sale creates a SISO in substance and so should be recharacterized as a SISO and treated as such in the bankruptcy. But unless the bankruptcy court treats a securitization transaction as a true sale of the receivables, the transaction will not accomplish its intended purpose and the value of the transaction will be diminished. Because a true sale and a SISO share many attributes, the distinction between them has proven difficult to draw in securitization and other complex transactions. The existing case law is confused and confusing, and none of the commentators has found an approach to characterization that has been wholly successful. This Article offers a property-based methodology for determining whether a transaction is a true sale or a SISO. One must first identify the specific allocation of rights between the purported buyer and seller and then determine whether the seller has retained any meaningful economic <b>interest</b> in the <b>receivables.</b> The property-based approach builds on the analysis of the true sale issue by others and borrows directly from the existing learning, literature, case law, and codification concerning an analogous determination: whether a true lease of goods should be recharacterized as a SISO. By focusing on the essential attributes of a sale and a SISO, the property-based methodology provides a workable way in which to give effect to the policy underlying recharacterization...|$|R
40|$|A presente dissertação examina a cessão fiduciária do direito do acionista aos dividendos, bem como a titularidade fiduciária (garantia real) dela resultante. A razão para a análise desses institutos deve-se ao aumento no uso desta forma de garantia em operações financeiras complexas {{realizadas}} no mercado nacional. Primeiramente, é feita uma análise das diversas acepções (perfis) que o direito do acionista ao dividendo pode assumir no contexto do ordenamento jurídico nacional, para daí concluir que tal direito é passível de cessão tanto em sua condição de crédito, presente ou futuro (a depender, justamente, da existência ou não de lucros sociais já deliberados), quanto em sua condição de direito expectativo. Isto é, de direito que o acionista detém, a partir do momento em que se torna titular de ações, de vir a adquirir direitos de créditos de dividendos a serem distribuídos pela companhia de tempos em tempos. Em razão da necessidade da imediata constituição da garantia real, especialmente diante de uma eventual falência ou recuperação judicial do devedor, este trabalho conclui que a titularidade fiduciária deve recair sobre o direito expectativo aos dividendos, visto ser ele um direito já existente e que permite ao seu respectivo titular se tornar, direta e imediatamente, proprietário dos créditos de dividendos que vierem a ser futuramente distribuídos pela companhia, desde que estes estejam limitados a certos valores e/ou períodos previamente acordados entre o credor/financiador e o devedor/acionista. Ademais, apesar de ser um direito inerente à participação social, o destaque e a cessão autônoma do direito expectativo aos dividendos não conflita com o disposto no art. 28 da LSA. O presente estudo argumenta também que o credor fiduciário pode, nos termos do art. 113 da LSA, exercer certos direitos de voto na companhia, desde que (1) o objeto da garantia seja o direito expectativo aos dividendos e (2) a sua influência nas deliberações sociais restrinja-se a estabelecer a forma como o lucro social será apurado e distribuído pela sociedade. Por fim, é argumentado também que, por ser uma garantia que recai sobre direitos patrimoniais pagos em dinheiro, duas consequências imediatas revelam- se aplicáveis: (i) durante o período em que não existe qualquer inadimplemento ou vencimento regular da dívida garantida, os dividendos que vierem a ser pagos pela companhia deverão ser destinados ao acionista devedor, podendo o credor deles se beneficiar apenas quando existir o efetivo vencimento ou inadimplemento da dívida; e (ii) durante o período de inadimplemento ou na data de vencimento regular da dívida, o credor pode reter os recursos necessários à satisfação de seu crédito, desde que restitua o eventual excedente ao acionista devedor, não havendo, por isso, razão que justifique o enquadramento da excussão da garantia como sendo uma violação à proibição do pacto comissório, conforme prevista no Direito brasileiro. This dissertation {{examines the}} fiduciary assignment of shareholders rights to dividends, {{as well as}} the fiduciary ownership (security interest) resulting from it. The reason for the analysis of these legal institutes comes from the increasing use of this type of security interest in complex financial transactions carried out in the local markets. Firstly, this works conducts the analysis of the various meanings (perspectives) which shareholdersŕights to dividends may have in different contexts of the Brazilian legal system, concluding that this right may be transferred either as a credit right, existing in the present or in the future (depending precisely on the existence of corporate profits already distributed or not), or as an expectance right. By this last one, we mean the right held by the shareholder as soon as he/she/it becomes the owner of the shares issued by a certain company that enables him/her/it to become the owner of the dividends distributed by the company from time to time. Due to the importance of the immediate granting of the security interest, especially in light of a possible bankruptcy or judicial reorganization process involving the debtor, this paper concludes that the fiduciary ownership should have the expectance right to dividends as its underlying asset. This is so because such right is already an existing right that allows the shareholder to become, directly and immediately, the owner of the dividends to be distributed by the company in the future, as long as those dividends are limited to certain amounts or periods previously agreed between the creditor/financier and the debtor/shareholder. Furthermore, despite being an inherent right to the equity stake, the detach of the expectance right to dividends from the shares which comes from, following by its assignment to other parties, does not conflict with the provision set forth in Section 28 of the Brazilian Corporation Act. This study also argues that the secured creditor may exercise certain voting rights in the company responsible for the payment of the dividends, pursuant to Section 113 of the Brazilian Corporation Act, provided that: (1) the underlying asset of the security interest is the expectance right to dividends; and (2) his/her/its influence in the companys decisions is limited to the manner according to which the corporate profits will be accounted and distributed by the company. Finally, it is also argued that, for being a security <b>interest</b> that has <b>receivables</b> as its underlying assets, two consequences turn out to be applicable. (i) Over the period {{in which there is no}} default or regular maturity of the secured debt, dividends paid by the company shall be allocated in favor of the shareholder/debtor. The creditor will be able to receive them in the maturity date or upon the occurrence of a default only. (ii) Over a default period or on the regular maturity date, the creditor may retain the necessary amount of dividends to satisfy his/her/its credit, provided that any excess cash shall be transferred to the shareholder/debtor, reason for which there are reasonable grounds to sustain that this foreclosure mechanism does not violate the non-retention of collateral assets convention rule (pacto comissório) provided under Brazilian law...|$|R
