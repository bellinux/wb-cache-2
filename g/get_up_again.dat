5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. non-urgent), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response, where they only respond to emergencies {{when all of the}} full-time emergency ambulance crews are busy. This may mean that a government or other service provide the 'emergency' cover, whilst a private firm may be charged with 'minor injuries' such as cuts, bruises or even helping the mobility-impaired if they have for example fallen and simply need help to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> but do not need treatment. This system has the benefit of keeping emergency crews available at all times for genuine emergencies. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. [...] In Latin America, private ambulance companies are often the only readily available EMS service ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{bears are}} thought to have become extinct in the British Isles in the year 500, while the last wolves were wiped out in 1786. Today the only wild animals {{remaining}} as a tangible threat to lambs in the British Isles are the red fox, badger, and predatory birds. [...] Domestic dogs are also a common cause of predation of lambs and sheep (they can also sometimes die of shock after any attempted predation or attack). If the neck and head of a lamb are still attached, and {{some or all of the}} organs consumed via biting a hole into the lower abdomen, but not much else, this is often a sign of badger predation. [...] Often only the lamb's stomach is ravaged - badgers like to drink the milk inside. [...] If the badger is not at all hungry, it may merely play with the carcass - biting the ears, in particular. [...] If the head's bitten off the carcass, it is usually a fox. [...] Dog damage to a lamb is more indiscriminate/variable, and the carcass' condition does not follow any fixed form. [...] Badgers will sometimes bite adult sheep without killing them - this is sometimes observed when a ewe is defending her lamb from the badger. [...] This almost always leads to infection around the bite - death will follow if costly treatment is not administered. [...] Badger predation varies regionally - in many areas it is commonplace, with the culprit sometimes caught in the act, whereas in some other sheep-farming areas with badgers, attacks are rare/not definitely identified. [...] Crows such as the hooded crow are known to take small lambs, often first disabling them by pecking out their eyes; if a sheep has fallen over during parturition or bad weather and cannot <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> <b>again</b> crows will first attack their eyes. Larger predatory birds such as golden eagles and large owls pose a threat to sheep in the north of Britain, where their ranges remain stable.|$|E

60|$|We {{had lain}} thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg {{now and then}} affectionately {{throwing}} his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> though day-break was yet some way down the future.|$|R
