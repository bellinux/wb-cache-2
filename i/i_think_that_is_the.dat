The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote.

6000|$|... “No, I’m {{sure it was}} no joke,” {{broke in}} our hero. “Wait, I’ll try that little side-door. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one the {{watchman}} generally uses.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "it's all done with Laboratory Work. We take, for instance, {{department}} stores. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first thing we}} do, we take up the department store." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no slouch of a compliment--kind of a dim {{religious}} light about it. I {{enjoy that}} sort of thing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} I heard any one link the comet {{with the end}} of the world. He had got that jumbled up with {{international}} politics and prophecies from the Book of Daniel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had great}} {{hopes that the}} British would take the place. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only time I have hoped, since I was made prisoner; {{but the old man}} is a good soldier, and beat them off.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they want}} to {{describe}} a finished young gentleman in France, I hear, they say of him, 'Il sait son Rabelais.' But if I want to describe one in England, I say, 'He knows his Bewick.' And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> higher compliment." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. COADE (undoubtedly hopeful). We mustn't be too sure, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> it. (Primly.) What <b>is</b> {{it exactly}} <b>that</b> you want, Mr. Coade? ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{definitely}} settled by the Conference at Versailles that Germany {{is to pay}} the Allies 3,912,486,782,421 marks. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> correct figure, though of course I am speaking only from memory.
