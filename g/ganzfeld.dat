40|$|A {{real-time}} {{visual processing}} theory {{is used to}} unify the explanation of monocular and binocular brightness data. This theory describes adaptive processes which overcome limitations of the visual uptake process to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. The brightness data include versions of the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet effect and its exceptions, Bergstrom's demonstrations comparing the brightnesses of smoothly modulated and step-like luminance profiles, Hamada's demonstrations of nonclassical differences between the perception ofltlminance decrements and increments, Fechner's paradox, binocular brightness averaging, binocular brightness summation, binocular rivalry, and fading of stabilized images and <b>ganzfelds.</b> Familiar concepts such as spatial frequency analysis, Mach bands, and edge contrast are relevant but insufficient to explain the totality of these data. Two parallel contour-sensitive processes interact to generate the theory's brightness, color, and form explanations. A boundary-contour process is sensitive to the orientation and amount of contrast {{but not to the}} direction of contrast in scenic edges. It generates contours that form the boundaries of monocular perceptual domains. The spatial patterning of these contours is sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elements. A featurecontour process is insensitive to the orientation of contrast, but is sensitive to both the amoun...|$|R

25|$|Between 1974 and 1982, 42 <b>ganzfeld</b> {{experiments}} were performed. In 1982, Charles Honorton presented a paper {{at the annual}} convention of the Parapsychological Association that summarized {{the results of the}} <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments up to that date, and concluded that they represented sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of psi. Ray Hyman, a psychologist, disagreed. The two men later independently analyzed the same studies, and both presented meta-analyses of them in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ganzfeld</b> {{experiment}} {{studies that}} were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological {{problems that were}} well documented.

25|$|The <b>ganzfeld</b> was {{originally}} introduced into experimental psychology {{due to the}} experiments of the German psychologist Wolfgang Metzger (1899–1979) on the perception of a homogenous visual field. In the early 1970s, Charles Honorton had been investigating ESP and dreams at the Maimonides Medical Center and began using the <b>ganzfeld</b> technique to achieve a state of sensory deprivation in which he hypothesised that psi could work. Honorton believed that by reducing the ordinary sensory input, psi conductive states may be enhanced and psi-mediated information could be transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} full {{experiment}} was published by Honorton and Sharon Harper in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1974, the <b>Ganzfeld</b> has remained a mainstay of parapsychological research.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} a number of reasons that {{researchers}} avoid special participants and sample only normal populations, these factors are important considerations in future replications of <b>ganzfeld</b> experiment, and may be useful in predicting the outcome of these studies.|$|E
25|$|Milton and Wiseman (1999) {{carried out}} a {{meta-analysis}} of <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments in other laboratories. They found no psi effect; the results showed no effect greater than chance from a database of 30 experiments and a non-significant Stouffer Z of 0.70.|$|E
25|$|Hyman wrote {{these studies}} were an {{improvement}} over their older counterparts, but were not a successful replication of the <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments, nor a confirmation of psi. He concluded the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed {{because they did not}} preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.|$|E
25|$|Possibilities {{of sensory}} leakage in the <b>ganzfeld</b> {{experiments}} included the receivers hearing {{what was going}} on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.|$|E
25|$|In {{their book}} 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology (2011), Scott O. Lilienfeld and colleagues have written that the <b>ganzfeld</b> being a {{reliable}} technique {{is far from}} being resolved. They concluded that ESP has not been successfully demonstrated in experiments for over 150 years so this is hardly encouraging.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ganzfeld</b> {{procedure}} {{has continued}} to be refined over the years. In its current incarnation, an automated computer system is used to select and display the targets ("digital autoganzfeld"). This overcomes many of the shortcomings of earlier experimental setups, such as randomization and experimenter blindness {{with respect to the}} targets.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the field}} of parapsychology, telepathy is {{considered}} to be a form of extrasensory perception (ESP) or anomalous cognition in which information is transferred through Psi. It is often categorized similarly to precognition and clairvoyance. Experiments have been used to test for telepathic abilities. Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the <b>Ganzfeld</b> experiment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the judging}} procedure, the {{receiver}} {{is taken out}} of the <b>Ganzfeld</b> state and given a set of possible targets, from which they select one which most resembled the images they witnessed. Most commonly there are three decoys along with the target, giving an expected rate of 25%, by chance, over several dozens of trials.|$|E
25|$|When {{using the}} <b>Ganzfeld</b> {{experiment}} {{to test for}} telepathy, one individual is designated the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are deprived of sensory input, and another is designated the sender and is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive information from the sender. The nature of the information may vary between experiments.|$|E
25|$|Another {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} by Daryl Bem, John Palmer, and Richard Broughton in which the experiments were sorted according to how closely they adhered to a pre-existing description of the <b>ganzfeld</b> procedure. Additionally, ten experiments that had {{been published in the}} time since Milton and Wiseman's deadline were introduced. Now the results were significant again with a Stouffer Z of 2.59.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Hyman and Honorton {{published}} A Joint Communiqué which {{agreed on}} the methodological problems and on ways to fix them. They suggested a computer-automated control, where randomization and the other methodological problems identified were eliminated. Hyman and Honorton agreed that replication of the studies was necessary before final conclusions could be drawn. They also agreed that more stringent standards were necessary for <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments, and they jointly specified what those standards should be.|$|E
25|$|Hyman {{criticized the}} <b>ganzfeld</b> papers for not {{describing}} optimal protocols, nor including the appropriate statistical analysis. He presented {{a factor analysis}} that he said demonstrated a link between success and three flaws, namely: flaws in randomization for choice of target; flaws in randomization in judging procedure; and insufficient documentation. Honorton asked a statistician, David Saunders, to look at Hyman's factor analysis and he concluded {{that the number of}} experiments was too small to complete a factor analysis.|$|E
25|$|Lance Storm and Suitbert Ertel (2001) {{published}} a meta-analysis of 79 studies published between 1974 and 1996 and concluded the positive statistically significant overall outcome indicates a psi effect. In response, Milton and Wiseman (2001) wrote the meta-analysis of Storm and Ertel {{was not an}} accurate quantitative summary of <b>ganzfeld</b> research as they had included early studies which had been widely recognized as having methodological problems which {{make it impossible to}} interpret the results as evidence of a psi effect.|$|E
25|$|In a 2007 review, Ray Hyman {{wrote that}} parapsychologists agree {{they have no}} {{positive}} theory of psi as it is negatively defined as any effect that cannot be currently {{explained in terms of}} chance or normal causes. Hyman saw this as a fallacy, as it encouraged parapsychologists to use any peculiarity in the data as a characteristic of psi. Hyman also wrote that parapsychologists have admitted it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of non-paranormal causes in the <b>ganzfeld</b> experiment. There is no independent method to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} psi.|$|E
2500|$|Consistent, {{independent}} {{replication of}} <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments {{has not been}} achieved for unselected participants, [...] but for selected participants (musicians, artists etc.) there is consistent, independent replication of <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments. Even for unselected participants there is positive and significant results by skeptic experimenters.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in 1985, C. E. M. Hansel {{discovered}} {{weaknesses in}} the design and possibilities of sensory leakage in the <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments reported by Carl Sargent and other parapsychologists. Hansel concluded the <b>ganzfeld</b> studies had not been independently replicated and that [...] "ESP is no nearer to being established than it was a hundred years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} common criticisms of {{some or all}} of the <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ganzfeld</b> studies {{examined}} by Hyman and Honorton had methodological {{problems that were}} well documented.

[...] Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained {{at least one of the}} 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 <b>ganzfeld</b> studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio {{analyzed}} 29 <b>ganzfeld</b> {{studies from}} 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with p < [...]001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics {{thought to be}} psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the <b>ganzfeld</b> condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm et al. According to Hyman [...] "reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence." [...] Hyman wrote the <b>ganzfeld</b> studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for psi. Storm et al. published a response to Hyman claiming the <b>ganzfeld</b> experimental design {{has proved to be}} consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder et al. in 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm et al.'s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for psi, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures. Storm et al. in reply showed several mistakes in Rouder et al.'s paper.|$|E
2500|$|Terence Hines {{wrote in}} 2003 that the <b>ganzfeld</b> studies {{could not be}} said to provide {{evidence}} for psi as the alleged evidence disappears as the tightness of experimental controls is increased. As research progresses variables in science become clearer as more studies are published that describe under what specific condition the particular effect can be demonstrated. This is in opposition to the <b>ganzfeld</b> studies. According to Hines, there was [...] "no clear way to obtain results showing any psychic phenomenon reliably" [...] and that [...] "the most reasonable conclusion" [...] was that the effect did not exist and had never existed.|$|E
2500|$|Bem and Honorton (1994) {{investigated}} certain {{personality traits}} and characteristics as potential psi-conducive variables which they suggested {{play an important}} role in claimed ESP performance. According to parapsychologists these factors are thought to be positively correlated with increased scores in <b>ganzfeld</b> experiments, as compared to unselected participants. Traits and characteristics of subjects thought to increase the chance of obtaining a successful hit rate in a psi experiment include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{was very}} {{familiar}} with folie à deux, Truzzi was very confident a shared visual hallucination could not be skeptically examined {{by one of the}} participators. Thus he categorized it as an anomaly. In a 1982 interview Truzzi stated that controlled ESP (<b>ganzfeld)</b> experiments have [...] "gotten the right results" [...] maybe 60 percent of the time. This question remains controversial. Truzzi remained an advisor to IRVA, the International Remote Viewing Association, from its founding meeting until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Hyman {{analyzed}} {{these experiments}} and wrote they met most, {{but not all}} of the [...] "stringent standards" [...] of the joint communiqué. He expressed concerns with the randomization procedure, the reliability of which {{he was not able to}} confirm based on the data provided by Bem. Hyman further noted that although the overall hit rate of 32% was significant, the hit rate for static targets (pictures) was in fact insignificant (inconsistently with previous <b>ganzfeld</b> research). The overall significance of the experiments was solely due to dynamic targets (videos). In the hit rates regarding these dynamic targets, however, some interesting patterns were found that implied visual cues may have been leaked: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} <b>ganzfeld</b> experiment, a [...] "receiver" [...] {{is placed in}} a room {{relaxing}} in a comfortable chair with halved ping-pong balls over the eyes, having a red light shone on them. [...] The receiver also wears a set of headphones through which white or pink noise (static) is played. [...] The receiver is in this state of mild sensory deprivation for half an hour. During this time, a [...] "sender" [...] observes a randomly chosen target and tries to mentally send this information to the receiver. [...] The receiver speaks out loud during the thirty minutes, describing {{what he or she}} can see. [...] This is recorded by the experimenter (who is blind to the target) either by recording onto tape or by taking notes, and is used to help the receiver during the judging procedure.|$|E
