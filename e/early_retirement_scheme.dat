40|$|Abstract. Human capital theory {{predicts that}} older workers {{are less likely}} to {{participate}} in on-the-job training than younger workers, due to lower net returns on such investments. <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> institutions are likely to affect these returns. Using the European Community Household Panel we show that older workers participate less in training, and that <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> institutions do indeed matter. Generous <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> discourage older workers from taking part in training, whereas flexible <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> encourage this. Finally, the results suggest that in most European countries training can keep older workers longer in the labour market. 1...|$|R

The way bridging pensions were defined (labour medical) and their clear cost meant that the number of potential cases was roughly 1 / 10 th of the previously possible <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> 36. Moreover, <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> was conditional on additional contributions paid earlier by employers. The entire scheme was temporal covering only those workers who had started working in special conditions or in a special capacity before 1999.

30|$|The {{increase}} in the retirement age – even if not contested in 1999 – was very abrupt. In order to avoid ex-post protests, the concept of bridging pensions was developed.

The termination of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> was legislated together with the entire reform bill package. However, the legislation did not include regulations on how the bridging pensions would be organised and financed. That legislation gap was not filled during the 10 years after adoption of the basic law bills. Politicians were afraid of touching that issue again, and this led to problems because the final date by which all <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> were to be terminated was 2006.

40|$|International audienceWe {{estimate}} the structural effects, costs and potential efficiency gains that might {{arise from the}} introduction of an <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> <b>Scheme</b> for farmers in Northern Ireland {{using data from the}} Farm Business Survey and a separate survey of 350 farmers aged between 50 and 65. Modelling results suggest that farm scale is a significant determinant of profit per hectare but that operator age is not. The economic gains from releasing land through a Scheme were conditional on transfers bringing about significant farm expansion and changes in land use. When these conditions were satisfied pensions payments of only about one-third the statutory maximum could be justified. Survey responses indicated that participation in the Scheme would bring forward farmers' retirement age by an average of four years. Moreover, 'deadweight' payments would equate to about 23 per cent of potential total expenditure.

In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted within 2 years of retirement with 59 British civil servants participating in the Whitehall II Study. Focusing on the experiences of 33 interviewees who spontaneously discussed “early retire-ment ” we identified three pathways to retirement (non-applicants, successful applicants, and unsuccessful applicants for <b>early</b> <b>retirement)</b> each influenced by a range of complementary positive and negative factors at work and at home. The <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> influenced the balance between these factors in three ways: by encouraging participants to reflect on (and recon-sider) existing retirement plans; by offering financial incentives to retire early; and because {{they were part of the}} ongoing process of restructuring and downsizing within the Civil Service which was accompanied by a perceived deterioration in conditions at work...|$|R

The most important finding is the independent role that is played by the number of years for which has built up pension claims.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} whether <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> patterns vary between countries with distinct <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> systems. By choosing countries that differ not only {{with respect to the}} coverage and generosity of publicly provided pensions but also with respect {{to the extent to which}} the state interferes in the non-public pillars of pension provision, we analyse to what extent such issues have an effect on individual <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> behaviour. Selectivity effects are expected to be stronger in countries with highly fragmented public systems or private <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes.</b> By pursuing a shift to more private pension provisions, governments might unintentionally create more inequality in <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> opportunities among the population. For the analysis we use longitudinal data, i. e. British Household Panel Study (BHPS) 1991 – 2004 (the United Kingdom), the German Socia-Economic Panel (GSOEP) 1990 – 2005 (Germany, and the Socia-Economics Panel (SEP) 1990 – 2001 (Netherlands) and a discrete-time competing-risks model. The results suggest that pursuing a shift from public to private <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> can lower the incidence of <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> Yet, at the same time, <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> can get more selective in that only the higher paid are able to afford it...|$|R

30|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, European governments {{focused on}} the {{promotion}} of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> for older workers in order to generate job opportunities and reduce unemployment for younger workers. These events prompted a reduction in employment rates of older individuals {{and an increase in}} the financial pressure of the social security systems which, coupled with the ageing of the society, triggered a shift in the policy focus towards ways of keeping older workers active in the labor market (Fischer et al. 2006). To achieve this goal, governments introduced several policies like monetary incentives for firms to hire older workers or limitations in the accession rules to the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, in many cases these efforts have not been translated into increases in activity rates of older workers because many of them are able to leave the labor market through alternative programs such as the disability or unemployment schemes.|$|R
40|$|Among EU 15 {{countries}} Finland {{has witnessed}} the largest {{increase in the}} employment of ageing workers since the late 1990 s. In these years there was a rapid change from the policy of promoting <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> to the policy of promoting staying at work. Furthermore, this rapid shift to a restrictive early exit policy took place in a situation that was especially demanding due to exceptionally high unemployment among elderly employees. This paper considers why and how the Finnish policy has been successful earlier than other EU countries in encouraging ageing workers to stay on at work. We argue that the positive change in employment is an outcome of the interplay between favourable economic trends and wide-scale work promotion measures. These work promotion measures include the restrictive changes in <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes.</b> A severe recession in the early 1990 s is an important background factor both for the increased need for reforms in the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>schemes</b> and also for making the reforms politically more acceptable.
