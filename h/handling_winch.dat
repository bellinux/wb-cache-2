40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the state of}} the art for driving technologies of anchor <b>handling</b> <b>winches</b> for offshore operations. These systems are necessary for anchor handling operations associated with installation of many types of moored floating offshore structures. To perform these operations, it is necessary to use specialized vessels known as AHT (Anchor Handling Tug) or AHTS (Anchor Handling Tug Supply) vessel, which incorporate specific equipment such as towing winches, but with higher performance than conventional tugs both in size and in technical performance. There are nowadays two main options for driving the Anchor Handling/Towing winches: hydraulic with low or high pressure motors, and electrical with AC motors driven by Variable Frequency Drives. Additionally, a new technology is appearing in the industrial sector which is starting to be applied in the marine sector, and in some cases for anchor handing winches: the permanent magnet motor. The aim of this paper is to discuss these driving technologies and their importance in the future of this part of the marine sector...|$|R

50|$|According to the Trajan's column {{representation}} (Scene XL), the carroballista was manoeuvred by one man {{mounted on}} the cart with the ballista and by another man positioned behind the cart and operating probably some sort of <b>winch</b> <b>handle.</b> The presence of the mules {{in front of the}} cart suggests that the carroballista could be easily moved through the battle-field whilst shooting bolts. This interpretation is not unanimously accepted by scholars.|$|R
50|$|During {{the journey}} {{it became clear}} that repairs had been inadequate. Chains were aded to the {{mainmast}} to help support its topmast, and it was noticed that rivets holding the collar around the mainmast were becoming loose. The ship's carpenter proposed drilling through the mast and inserting a <b>winch</b> <b>handle</b> to ensure the collar stayed in place, but the captain refused. Only the skysail yards were taken down to reduce loading on the masts.|$|R
5000|$|The rope {{is usually}} stored on the winch (a similar machine {{that does not}} store the rope is called a capstan). When {{trimming}} a line on a sailboat, the crew member turns the <b>winch</b> <b>handle</b> with one hand, while tailing (pulling on the loose tail end) with the other to maintain tension on the turns. Some winches have a [...] "stripper" [...] or cleat to maintain tension. These are known as [...] "self-tailing" [...] winches.|$|R
50|$|Typically, windjammers are {{equipped}} with semi-mechanized rigging, steel profile masts and yards and steel cables as running rigging where possible. Often also the running rigging was <b>handled</b> by motor <b>winches</b> instead of manpower. Since the windjammer hull is optimized for good hydrodynamics because of sail handling, they were (and still are) capable of sustained high cruising speeds; most four-masted barques were able to cruise at 15 kn on plausible winds, some logged 18 kn regularly and Herzogin Cecilie {{is known to have}} logged 21 kn.|$|R

At every few turns his descent was stopped that he might examine the walls of the well, and when he was about fifty feet down he called to them to hold on, which they did, listening while he struck at the rock with a hammer, for here it sounded very hollow.|$|R

They then swept out of the room, followed by the two men with the papers. At the same instant several rough-looking fellows in stout jerkins came bustling in and removed first the red carpet, and then the boards which formed the dais, so as to entirely clear the room. When this screen was removed I saw some singular articles of furniture behind it. One looked like a bed with wooden rollers at each end, and a <b>winch</b> <b>handle</b> to regulate its length. Another was a wooden horse. There were several other curious objects, and a number of swinging cords which played over pulleys. It was not unlike a modern gymnasium.|$|R

40|$|Log {{bunching}} with winches {{is still}} popular in small scale forest operations, and where machine traffic {{is confined to}} widely spaced designated trails. Like all tree <b>handling</b> methods, <b>winching</b> has a potential to incur residual stand damage, especially when harvested trees need to be moved around a dense residual stand. Snatch blocks are special pulleys designed for changing the pulling direction, in order to maneuver the winch load around obstacles. This study was aimed at determining the effect of using a snatch block on stand damage and work productivity. Using a snatch block allowed reducing by one quarter the frequency of wounded trees, which dropped from 50 % to 36 %. The snatch block was especially effective in preventing damage to dominant trees. No significant difference was recorded for wound size and wound severity. Survival of advance regeneration was significantly higher when using a snatch block. When no block was used, {{almost half of the}} saplings were lost. In contrast, only one sapling out of four was lost when using a snatch block. Using a snatch block did not cause any significant change of work productivity. Lower incidence of hang-up delays and faster pulling fully offset the time required to rig the snatch block. The study did not include ergonomics, and could not indicate how operator workload was affected by adding the weight of a snatch block to that of the cable and chain rigging. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} play {{an important}} role in modern engineering. This is partly because simulation generally is less expensive, safer and more time efficient compared to experimental testing and prototyping. There are a variety of modelling and simulation tools on the market today. This report concerns the development of a dynamic simulation model for an active heave compensation winch system, using the software tool 20 -sim. The model is developed in cooperation with the company Cargotec that is a world leading company within manufacturing of large offshore load <b>handling</b> equipment. The <b>winch</b> system has been analyzed and a dynamic simulation model has been developed. To optimize and confirm the validity of the model, experimental testing was performed by the support of Cargotec. The optimization was based on several test runs using varying input parameters. Model parameters were estimated by comparing simulated and experimental data. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model is in accordance with the experimental results. The motion controller used in this work consist of a feedforward control and a feedback controller. Three different feedforward strategies were evaluated and tested on the winch system. One feedforward which was explored is the model-based prediction of input. A model-based feedforward dependent on pressure measurements was successfully implemented. Based on the quality of the developed simulation model it is concluded that it can be used to study system behavior under different operating conditions. In addition, it can be used to analyze and design controllers for the system...|$|R
