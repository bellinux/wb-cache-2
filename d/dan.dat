5|$|Abbe was {{involved}} in a car accident in 1960 which left him with severe neck injuries that had lasting effects on his health. While the precise date is unclear, Abbe had been promoted to 8th <b>dan</b> by late 1960. Independent sources from the late 1960s include this rank with his name. In addition to his ranks in judo, aikido, and kendo, he held the rank of 5th <b>dan</b> in karate and <b>dan</b> ranks in kyūdō and jūkendō.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Dan</b> travels across Gallowmere, {{fighting}} his {{way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but <b>Dan</b> manages to defeat him. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, <b>Dan</b> escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, <b>Dan</b> returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, <b>Dan</b> will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dan</b> and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, <b>Dan</b> proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, <b>Dan</b> sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, <b>Dan</b> and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, <b>Dan</b> and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give <b>Dan</b> his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but <b>Dan</b> feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E
5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when <b>Dan</b> is hit. It will deplete completely if <b>Dan</b> drowns or falls from a great height. If <b>Dan</b> runs out of health, the game will end. <b>Dan</b> can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles <b>Dan</b> has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, <b>Dan</b> is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E
5|$|During an {{incident}} in which Kiya goes off on her own, she is killed by Jack the Ripper, much to Dan's shock. Having discovered a time machine, <b>Dan</b> travels {{back in time to}} save Kiya in Whitechapel, merging with his past self to gain golden armour. As <b>Dan</b> finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the pages from him and uses them to summon a large blue demon. <b>Dan</b> manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them. As Palethorn blows up his lair with his last breath, <b>Dan</b> decides to join Kiya in the afterlife as they return to their eternal rest. If the player has collected all the Chalices, <b>Dan</b> and Kiya go for a ride on the time machine which takes them back to {{the time of the first}} MediEvil instead.|$|E

A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young (typically 15 years or younger) for 1st <b>dan.</b> Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st <b>dan</b> when they reach 18 years of age.

5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{a variety of}} levels, many of which require certain {{objectives}} to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, <b>Dan</b> is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. <b>Dan</b> can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, <b>Dan</b> can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer <b>Dan</b> information while blue ones allow <b>Dan</b> to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{decision analysis}} networks (<b>DANs)</b> {{as a new}} type of probabilistic graphical model. Like influence diagrams (IDs), <b>DANs</b> are much more compact and easier to build than decision trees, and are able to represent con-ditional independencies. Both IDs and <b>DANs</b> can represent symmetric problems, but <b>DANs</b> can also represent problems involving restrictions between the values of the variables (structural asymme-try) and partial orderings of the decisions (order asymmetry). Therefore, <b>DANs</b> can easily model and solve many real-world problems that IDs can-not. We argue that <b>DANs</b> compare favorably with other formalisms proposed for modeling asymmet-ric decision problems. Additionally, we offer Open-Markov as an open source software tool for editing and evaluating <b>DANs.</b> I...|$|R

5|$|An evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to {{take over}} the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds. In reality however, <b>Dan</b> was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king {{choosing}} to cover it up and declare <b>Dan</b> a hero. Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of <b>Dan,</b> who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes, <b>Dan</b> uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Dan</b> travels across Gallowmere, {{collecting}} {{pieces of}} an artifact called the 'Anubis Stone' along the way, fighting {{his way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but <b>Dan</b> manages to defeat him. As Zarok sets his lair to self-destruct, <b>Dan</b> is rescued by Al-Zalam and the two escape, leaving Zarok's magical influence over the land thwarted. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, <b>Dan</b> returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber and ascends to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E
