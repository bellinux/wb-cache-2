25|$|Theological determinism: The {{idea that}} the future is already {{determined}}, either by a creator deity decreeing or knowing its outcome in advance.

25|$|The Orthodox Church {{offers the}} spiritual healing so many need as they realize the {{emptiness}} of secularism and materialism. The task <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the Church is to offer true spirituality rather than the empty entertainment that passes for Christianity in the West. We must get beyond duels over the Scripture with fundamentalists and revisionists, and instead challenge people with the evidence we have for the true healing and theosis found only in the Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves.

Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E

In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make it <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the States {{we might as well}} forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the US again, [...] "only achiev limited success overseas." [...] After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left, and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study. Brown, Doyle, and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members.|$|E

500|$|Flanders was {{an early}} and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy’s [...] "misdirection of our efforts at {{fighting}} communism” and his role in “the loss of respect <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the world at large.” He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the “alarming world-wide advance of Communist power” that would leave the United States and Canada as “the last remnants of the free world.” On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns. (McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that President Eisenhower {{stayed out of the}} McCarthy controversy. Members of President Eisenhower’s cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should “lay off.” ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 May Worsley advised Shackleton that {{he could}} not be sure of their {{position}} within ten miles. To avoid the possibility of being swept past the island by the fierce south-westerly winds, Shackleton ordered a slight change of course so that the James Caird would reach land on the uninhabited south-west coast. They would then try to work the boat round to the whaling stations on the northern side of the island. [...] "Things were bad <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> those days", wrote Shackleton. [...] "The bright moments were those when we each received our one mug of hot milk during the long, bitter watches of the night". Late on the same day floating seaweed was spotted, and the next morning there were birds, including cormorants which were known never to venture far from land. Shortly after noon on 8 May came the first sighting of South Georgia.|$|E
500|$|During its development, Lords of Shadow {{was placed}} on several lists for most {{anticipated}} video games.

He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't going to like what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{to produce}} an {{adaption}} of [...] "The Snow Queen" [...] in the Disney studio dated back to 1943, when Walt Disney considered collaborating with Samuel Goldwyn to produce a biography film of Hans Christian Andersen. However, the story and particularly the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators. Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main protagonist, Gerda (who later served as an inspiration for Anna), and the Snow Queen. Most obviously, Andersen's version did not feature any confrontation between them: when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay, the Snow Queen {{is nowhere to be}} seen. There just was not enough character conflict to form a full-length feature. Later on, Glen Keane, Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, Harvey Fierstein, Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen, but none of them made their way. Around 2008, Chris Buck pitched Disney his version of The Snow Queen. At the time, the project was planned to be traditionally animated under the name of Anna and the Snow Queen. However, by early 2010, the project encountered the same problem and was stuck again. Jennifer Lee, Frozens co-director, later recalled, [...] "The issue with the original <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a lot of ways is it's a very symbolic story. It's very hard to translate symbolism into concrete things. Film is concrete, so you translate it." ...|$|E

500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E
