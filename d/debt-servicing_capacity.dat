This paper aims to fill this gap by developing a financial index that concentrates on cash flows, <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity,</b> profitability and asset utilisation to evaluate the financial performance of SMEs in China. Principal components analysis and an efficiency coefficient method are used to develop the required index, using a sample of 860 Chinese firms. While shown to have a potential capacity to develop and have efficient assets management skills, the sample SMEs exhibit a relatively weak capability of generating an operating cash flow; weak capability of exploring distribution channels; limited innovation capacity; and weak profitability and capability of paying their short-term loans. The study concludes that strengthening the efficiency usage of capital {{is an important step}} towards enhancing profitability. ...|$|E
40|$|Public {{investment}} and infrastructure spending are often {{singled out for}} drastic cuts at times of fiscal retrenchment. Fiscal austerity in Latin America during the 1980 s and 1990 s was characterized by a sharp contraction in infrastructure spending. In 5 of the 9 major Latin American countries, infrastructure investment cuts contributed half {{or more of the}} total fiscal adjustment. However, the compression of infrastructure spending does not guarantee the sustainability of the public sector. Infrastructure spending cuts not only reduce the public deficit (thereby raising the public sector’s net worth) but also leads to a decline in infrastructure stock accumulation and in output growth as well. This in turn implies a reduction in the economy’s <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity,</b> thus weakening the public sector net worth (Easterly, 2001). In the present paper we quantitatively assess the growth cost of public infrastructure compression for major Latin American economies during the fiscal austerity period of the 1980 s and 1990 s, and examine the effectiveness of infrastructure spending cuts as a device to enhance public sector solvency. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds a}} multiperiod, general {{equilibrium}} framework for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of financial reforms {{in developing countries}} {{and the costs of}} maintaining official safety nets under the financial system during such reforms. While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit insurance funding obligations even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the funding obligations associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity</b> of nonfinancial firms is low.

40|$|Household and {{corporate}} indebtedness has soared {{in recent years}} and is now at historically high levels. The market for credit today is unrecognisable compared with just 30 years ago when, in the national economic interest, the rate of credit growth was controlled centrally. The central questions addressed in this paper are whether households {{and corporate}}s are over-indebted now and why this might be a worrying development? Previous authors have suggested that over-indebtedness may have severe consequences: (i) higher rates of arrears and bankruptcies, (ii) sharp contractions in investment and consumption, and (iii) increased fragility in the banking system. The aggregate evidence on indebtedness is contrasted with micro-data on households, corporates and credit institutions. This paper concludes that households and corporates may not be over-indebted when (i) account is also taken of improvements in their <b>debt-service</b> <b>capacity</b> and (ii) micro-data is used to qualify the aggregate indebtedness data. Furthermore, credit institutions appear to be well insulated against severe shocks that could potentially arise from households or corporates...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural land values turned upward during 1987, after {{registering}} six successive {{years of}} decline. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln 1988 Farm Real Estate Market Survey reported a 13 percent gain for the 12 -month period ending February 1, 1988. Increases were evident for virtually {{all types of}} agricultural land and {{in all areas of}} the state, although there was variation in magnitude among the substate regions. The reversal of the long-term decline in agricultural land values stems primarily from improved farm income levels. Also, the preceding devaluation has positioned agricultural land values such that earnings have become more competitive with alternative investment opportunities. These factors, in combination with some carry-over demand from when the market was essentially dormant, have stirred buyer interest in recent months. Obviously, a stronger agricultural land market has brought considerable and immediate financial relief to the farm sector. While improved income has strengthened <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity,</b> the rise in farm real estate values has contributed to better collateral positions for thousands of farm owner­ operators across the state. Additionally, the 2 ̆ 2 upbeat 2 ̆ 2 nature of the market translates directly into increased asset liquidity - thereby facilitating financial restructuring via land liquidation. Sales were reportedly up in 1987 after an extended period of abbreviated activity. While reporters estimated about half the sales were due to financial pressure, the incidence of stress-related activity was clearly down from the previous year. Reasons for purchase were perceived as being much like those of earlier years, with expansion of operation continuing to be the most frequently cited motive. There was some evidence that particular buyer interest existed in parcels enrolled in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), although whether or not it commanded a price premium was less certain. On the basis of more detailed information reported for some 480 transactions, the variability of the land market characteristics from one part of the state to another was quite evident. Both average acreage size and average price per acre were highly variable, although average parcel price was fairly uniform. Throughout the state, active farmers were the primary buyer group in 1987. More than half the transactions represented cash sales with no indebtedness incurred by the buyer. Consistent with higher farm income levels in 1986 and 1987, negotiated cash rental rates for 1988 were higher. Cropland rates were generally 5 to 10 percent above 1987 levels. Likewise, pasture rental rates increased throughout most of the state as the cattle market rebounded...|$|E
40|$|Following strong value {{advances}} {{over the}} past several years, Nebraska farmland values throttled down and stabilized across most of the state during the 12 -month period ending February 1, 2009. According the 2009 UNL Nebraska Farm Real Estate Survey, the average all-land value rose just over 1 % for the year. Some modest decreases in value were reported for some classes of land, but relative to recent trends for residential and commercial property across the U. S., stable values for agricultural land speaks to its relative strength in the current recession. Regional differences in value shifts were rather significant over the time period. Some of the regions, where more modest gains had occurred in recent years, experienced somewhat stronger upward changes {{over the past}} year. Likewise, by land class, there were notable variations in value changes, with the irrigated land classes showing the stronger advances. Survey reporters in early 2009 were observing market factors in much different perspective than in previous years. In fact, the majority of factors believed to influence land value trends turned from positive influence to negative influence on area land values. Many of these factors reflect macro aspects of the national and global economy, and clearly indicate the connectedness of the agricultural land market to macroeconomic forces. Market characteristics of sales activity in 2008 were a continuation of the trends of recent years. Four out of every five buyers were active farmers, with {{more than half of the}} transactions (51 %) being cash purchases without debt financing. The reported cash rent patterns for 2009 generally showed only minor changes from 2008 levels. Even though the crop sector was coming off a very favorable income year in 2008, both tenants and landowners entered the 2009 crop season with considerable caution. As for grazing land rental rates, most areas of the state saw relatively stable rent levels on a monthly basis. Gross rent to value ratios (current rent as a percent of current value levels) show considerable variation across regions and land classes, and, to some extent are lower for 2009 relative to year- earlier levels. In turn, the <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity</b> associated with land acquisitions in the current market are fairly low—in most cases being in the 30 to 40 % range if one assumes net returns based on cash rent levels. However, given that (1) the vast majority of buyers are active farmers who will be farming the land themselves with higher income expectations, and (2) half of the land transfers are for cash, the relatively low debt-servicing levels may not be a significant constraint in the current market...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} foreign aid in the economy of Pakistan {{in terms of its}} effects on economic growth, income equality, poverty and the debt burden. It also evaluates Pakistan's debt servicing and debt retirement capacities and its debt management practices. The thesis finds that foreign aid has not contributed favorably to GDP growth and income equality, though it has been effective, in a limited way, in reducing the extent of poverty. The ineffectiveness of aid can be attributed to indirect diversion of aid funds to non-productive activities and inefficiency in resource allocation especially in the public sector associated with the easy availability of foreign aid. However, the study argues that foreign aid has been instrumental in supporting the growth rate in consumption that otherwise would not have been possible. Furthermore foreign aid and external borrowing made it easier to avoid hard policy choices such as heavy taxation of income and consumption. The thesis finds that Pakistan's long-run <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity</b> is extremely low, primarily due to low savings and productivity. It is further observed that with the current state of savings and productivity, Pakistan has to choose between sacrificing growth and prolonging the unsustainable position of continuously growing debt burden. The thesis concludes that the practice of reliance on foreign aid is unsustainable unless efforts are made, on continuous basis, to overcome the basic weaknesses in the economy. Pakistan must improve its saving rate by continuing and even further refining the ongoing process or tax reforms, down sizing of the public sector and privatization of public sector enterprises. Pakistan needs to improve its overall productivity in the economy, especially in the public sector. The privatization process needs to be accelerated for the sake of minimizing the cost of losses in the public sector and improving productivity rather than revenue generation. Pakistan also needs to manage its debt in a better way. There is utmost need for enrichment of the intellectual capacity in the public sector institutions responsible for debt management. These institutions also need to be reformed thoroughly and given sufficient autonomy. Finally, the thesis concludes that Pakistan has to be selective in choosing among the alternative aid and loan packages. External borrowing has to be target specific and the targets have to be specified in the light of a social welfare function that assigns due weight to social as well as economic considerations such as growth enhancement, promotion of equity and social justice and eradication of poverty. External borrowing must be undertaken within the framework of economic plans rather than making the planning exercise contingent on the availability of external resources...|$|E
40|$|Most poor {{developing}} countries, {{especially those}} with limited natural resources, low savings and investment levels, natural disaster stricken, need help from the affluent nations {{in order to meet}} some of their development objectives. Still, some that are rich in natural resources equally depend on some form of aid. Though most growth theories stress on investment as an important step to steady economic growth, they are mostly silent on the importance of aid as a component of in vestment and growth to developing countries. Like in other aid and growth literature, aid is viewed as a tool to relief most developing countries out of their resource constraint and human misery. The issue of foreign assistance originated as part of efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II and subsequently extended to developing countries. Two main rationales for foreign assistance are outlined by the south centre in an overview of financial flows to developing countries. The first reason was that developing countries had only a limited <b>debt-servicing</b> <b>capacity</b> which meant borrowing from commercial sources could ply only a relatively minor role in financing development. Secondly, for macro economic considerations, developing countries need financial aid to invest more than what their domestic savings could allow and also to help supplement the countries exchange resources which where generally severely constrained. Thus, development assistance constituted an explicit commitment by the industrialized nations to support financially the development of the south. This not withstanding, there has been heated debates amongst international aid agencies, donor governments, researchers and writers on foreign aid and growth if actually aid has and can contribute to growth. This debate and doubt spring from the rising and persistent misery {{in most parts of the}} developing world, notably sub-Saharan Africa. Blames have been laid on a long list of different causes: recipient governments, insufficient quantity and quality of aid, multiple purposes of aid (that is unfocused aid). Most recent empirical work on the impact of aid on growth have found that lump sum aid in itself has very little or no impact on growth. They however, have found that foreign aid has a positive impact on growth but this positive impact is heavily dependent on recipient countrys specific characteristics characteristics. Worth mentioning in this work are: a sound policy environment (Burnside and Dollar (2000)); economic liberalization (Cungu and Swinnen (2003)); quality of institutions and bureaucracy (Moene K et al (2003)); among others. This thesis uses a similar technique as Burnside and Dollar (2000) to assess theoretically and empirically the role of foreign aid on the economic growth of developing countries. It focuses on the role of governance as a background characteristic on the effectiveness (ineffectiveness) of foreign aid on growth. The thesis uses data on the net aid flow from all donors as a percentage of recipient GDP [source: African Development Indicators World Bank Africa Database (2005) ]. The aid data for the other countries are obtained from the World Development Report (2000 / 2001) and include Official Development assistance as a percentage of recipient s GNP. The data for Real GDP per capita is from Penn World Table, Heston et al (2006; Penn World Table Version 6. 2) data set, source: www. pwt. econ. The growth of GDP per capita is the average increase of GDP per capita from 1998 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2002. The data on aggregates of 6 dimensions of governance indicators is from a research working paper by a World Bank Research group, D. Kaufmann et al (2005). The governance indicators include the control of corruption, voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and the rule of law. The various data set was used in running linear regression of growth and aid models using Ordinary Least Squares regression method in STATA software. These econometric operations were done to investigate empirically the following questions: 1) Do poor countries receive more aid? And generally which other factors affect the allocation of aid? 2) How does foreign aid contribute to the economic growth of developing countries? 3) Has the improvement in governance contributed in any way to economic growth 4) Does the quality of governance contribute to the effectiveness of foreign aid vis-à-vis economic growth?. Empirical results of the linear regressions show that everything else equal, poor countries get more aid than rich countries. Average aid receipts varies across the regions in the from 1998 to 2000 at the tone of 9. 6 %, 4. 17 % and 7. 74 % for Sub-saharan Africa, south America and central America and the Caribbean respectively. Consistent with other works, the estimation results show that lump sum aid has had no positive impact on growth. The interaction terms between aid and rule of law (Aid/GDP*rl), aid and government effectives (Aid/GDP*ge) and, aid and voice and accountability (Aid/GDP*va) have small positive coefficient, these are however not significant. This implies that aid has some impact on growth in an economy where there is enforcement of rule of law, voice and accountability and the government is effective. Apart from control of corruption which has a small positive and non significant correlation with growth, all the others have no correlation with growth. Improvement in governance has had no direct impact on growth. From the results, it seems the debate over the issue that lump sum aid has and cannot contribute to growth might take quite a different turn. This is because most empirical works have found similar results, and most significant relations between aid and growth are dependent on some factors. Quite often the ineffectiveness of lump sum aid is blamed on the governance quality of the recipient economy, but this study cannot confirm this claim in spite the fact that there is said to have been improvement in governance over the period 1996 to 2005. The effect of the opposite movement of aid could be a likely cause of the strange relationship amongst aid, governance and growth (the declining trend of aid allocation since 1994). It could equally be that there is no link between governance and growth. The thesis concludes by noting that a few developing countries are on the tract for better growth. Furthermore, that there are prospects for a brighter picture in terms of aid effectiveness and growth if there can be some procedural adjustments, both by donors and recipients. Aid should set more modest goals, like helping some of the people some of the time, rather than trying to be the catalyst for society wide transformation (Easterly, 1993...|$|E
