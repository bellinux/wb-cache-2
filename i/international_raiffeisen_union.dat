50|$|In 1902-1905, the PȚD pursued an {{alliance}} policy with politicians {{from the other}} ethnic groups—including, most controversially, Ukrainian nationalists. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a Progressive Peasants' Fellowship, which dominated the Diet of Bukovina and, in 1904, passed an electoral reform project drafted by Benno Straucher. Ethnic rivalries pushed the group back into sectarian politics before the legislative elections of 1907. The PȚD embraced economic antisemitism and, together with the PNPR, merged into Christian Social Romanian Party in 1908. It continued to have an autonomous existence, with its elite controlling Bukovina's state bank and <b>Raiffeisen</b> credit <b>union.</b> Its business practices nearly drove Bukovina's economy into insolvency, turning other Romanians against Onciul.|$|R
5000|$|On May 28, 1905, the Fellowship was {{denounced by}} the PȚD, and ceased to exist. On July 17, it merged into Modest Grigorcea's reconstructed National Romanian Party (PNR), but {{continued}} to function informally as a Democratic wing, still putting out Voința Poporului to October 1908. Running on PNR lists for the by-elections of Chernowitz—Sereth—Storozynetz, Onciul easily won {{a seat in the}} Austrian House of Deputies, and was reelected at Gura Humora in the full-term elections of 1907.

40|$|Thet hesis {{seeks to}} reveal {{and explain the}} nature of the affective {{relations}} encapsulated within the 'common bond' definition of historical and contemporary examples of credit unions. In doing so, it is argued that a credit union is best understood as an 'elective association'. The reality-congruence of 'elective association' as a distinct sociological concept is explored,in relation to: i) the ambiguity surrounding the concept of 'community' in contemporary sociology; and ii) the concept's usefulness in enabling researchers to account for different forms of elective association and, crucially, the affective motivations within them. The substantive analysis takes the form of 3 historical and contemporary case studies into the formation and development of credit unions. The first examines the <b>Raiffeisen</b> credit <b>union</b> movement of South-Western Germany in the late nineteenth century, the second explores the origins of the US credit union movement with particular reference to the formation of credit unions in Manhattan from 1914; and the third analyses the significance of, and prospects for, the common bond among credit unions in contemporary English society. The theoretical core of the thesis rests upon Elias's concept of a figuration and, specifically, the problem of human interdependencies and affective bonds. In arguing that credit unions are elective associations, Schmalenbach's 'Bund'concept is employed in tandem with Elias's insights and Shils's extension of the concept, and is argued to help transcend the conceptual dichotomy locked within the GemeinschaftlGesellschaft concept. In the analysis of English credit union formations and development, Bauman's 'consumer society' thesis is considered, as are Giddens's arguments concerning the bases of personal trust and the influence of 'expert systems' in 'reflexive modernity'. Lash's critique of Giddens is also examined and is argued to be largely commensurate with the general tenor of Schmalenbach's insights...|$|R
50|$|A {{subsidiary}} of Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich, <b>Raiffeisen</b> Bank <b>International</b> operates a banking network in Central and Eastern Europe. 17 markets {{are covered with}} subsidiary banks, leasing companies and representative offices. As of end-2010, RBI served more than 14 million customers via roughly 3,000 branch offices. At the end of February 2010, RZB CEO Walter Rothensteiner announced that a possible merger of RZB with <b>Raiffeisen</b> <b>International</b> Bank-Holding AG (RI) was being considered.2 This move would open up broader access to the capital, money and bond markets. As all of these changes would take place within the group, it would have {{no impact on the}} equity capital ratios. The newly founded <b>Raiffeisen</b> Bank <b>International</b> AG would contain RI and those parts of RZB that do not involve business with the Raiffeisen sector. Business related to RZB's function as the central institution of the Raiffeisen Banking Group and those participations relevant for this sector were to remain at RZB. On 19 April 2010, the executive boards of the two institutions resolved to present a proposal on this merger to the shareholders for approval. At the general shareholders meeting on 7 July 2010, the shareholders of RZB voted to spin off the bank's commercial customer business and the related participations from RZB and to merge these with RI. The next day, the shareholders of RI approved this merger at a general shareholders meeting. The newly founded institution, <b>Raiffeisen</b> Bank <b>International</b> AG, began its activities on 11 October 2010.|$|R
