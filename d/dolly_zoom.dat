50|$|The {{same field}} size can be {{achieved}} at varied camera-subject distances by using a lens with a compensating focal length, and at varied focal lengths by choosing a compensating camera-subject distance. Field size differs from framing in that within professional environments where prime lenses are dominant, the latter applies only to camera placement (including camera angle), not focal length. However, maintaining an identical field size at varying camera-subject distances and focal lengths must be handled with caution as it applies different amounts of perspective distortion to the image: wide-angle lenses expand a perspective, while long focus lenses compress a perspective (the famous <b>dolly</b> <b>zoom,</b> taken with a variable focal length lens, is a vivid, intuitive demonstration of this effect). Thus, it's more common in photography and cinematography to determine an image's field size by only changing two out of the two factors.|$|E

The world as perceived by the individual may feel like it is going through a <b>dolly</b> <b>zoom</b> effect. Such perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste, and smell.

Architectural {{space is}} the shelter for {{experiences}} and {{memories of the}} body, and is the form to the temporal activities in space. Body generates the space in itself as a perceiving, sensible and recalling subject. Time provides body to perceive and recollect the space and produce new memories by recollecting simultaneously in every moment of perceiving. Thus, space, time and body are in an integrated and dynamic relationship, which comes into existence through {{the experience of the}} body. In this integrated relationship existing through bodily experience, the architectural representation techniques are crucial for designing and representing the architectural space interrelated with body and time. As long as these techniques are addressed via the relationship between body, space and time, lived space gets embodied in the representation. This dissertation is a research on cinematography as an architectural representation technique. It starts with the bodily experience of space and time and continues with how the cinematography produces this experience outside of the body and reunites the production with the body. Throughout this research, the spatial and temporal experience of the body is intensified by phenomenology. The production of this experience by cinema is examined through the readings on cinema theory and cinematic techniques. The formation of cinema and the instruments used during this formation process are discussed in terms of representing body, space and time relationship as a whole. The kind of spatial and temporal experiences produced via the embodiment of the techniques, which are used in the different stages of the production, are exemplified by film analyses. In {{the first part of the}} research, spatial and temporal experience of the body is studied with the readings on phenomenology. Body is defined by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's term body image. Body image is explained as a sensible and recollecting subject who provides a physical existence of being and provides a physical existence of the world inside the body. Within this context, objects attaining their existence thorough the perception of the body is explained with the concept of embodiment. Embodiment is used in two meanings throughout the research. One is to gain a physical existence. The other is to have this existence in presence of a body. Through the second meaning, the body as the perceiving subject becomes like a shelter for the objects to exist. In this context, different senses of body, providing perception, are examined in detail. Then the integrated relationship among them is investigated. The different senses complete each other and transform into each other due to this interrelated relationship. In the moment of perception also recollection occurs simultaneously. This dynamic and continuous relationship happens in every moment of perception. So this relationship connects present to past in every arriving second. Therefore in the research, this interactive relationship of body and objects are examined by the definitions on time. The different approaches on the notion of time are addressed. Herewith, time definitions of Deleuze and Bergson are indicated in detail. Coexistence of present and past is examined through the perception of 'now' and the remembrance of 'past' which create spatial experience jointly. ¬† Within the scope of this research, production of spatial experience outside of the body is investigated through cinematography as an architectural representation technique. It is analyzed in the context of presenting a new space production directly related with time and embodying this production within the spectator. Cinematography, meaning "writing movement", mechanically produces time and space outside the body and reunites them by embodying this production in the spectatorial body. ¬†First of all, the discovery process of cinematography is researched in an historical frame. Initially Camera Obscura is addressed as the first tool of creating a representation of the bodily vision. The vision is carried out of the human body for the first time and a visual reproduction of space is produced in a dark room. Than the same mechanism is used to create Camera Lucida for to use in perspective drawings. This gave the ability to draw the reflection of the real space on paper and this technique influenced Renaissance perspective drawings. Then allied again with advancement of Camera Obscura, photography is investigated with its features to freeze the time and physicalize the place by distracting it from the body. But photography created a spatial production by separating space from time and freezing the spatial movement. To add time to the frozen space in photography, various attempts like Zoetrope, Praxinoscope, Zoopranxinoscope and Chronophotograph were seen in this period, which inserted movement to photography. Lastly, cinematography, which is recording of time itself, is researched as a combined production of space and time. Cinema produces a brand new space and time outside of the body, apart from the bodily perception. Cinema makes this production by writing down the motion itself, not by freezing time. This revealed the distinction of cinematography from other methods researched under this topic. Furthermore, the cinematographic techniques of recording and recreating space associated with time are researched. In the fourth section of the research, the different tools and techniques of cinematography that provide the space and time production are explored. The mechanical production of cinematography consists of two phases: recording and editing. In the first phase, real space is recorded on a linear temporal plane. In the second phase recorded spaces are fragmentized and edited on a new temporal plane. In analyzing this mechanical production firstly, the main tool camera is considered as a mechanical eye, which provides a production of physical vision out of the body. It creates the physical boundaries of space and defines the seen and the unseen in the filmic space. The notions of in-frame and out-of-frame explain that definition of space by the camera. The spatial and temporal production changing by means of different angles, viewpoints, positions and movements of camera is investigated. Following, cutting the records into fragments and fictionalizing new space and time combinations via montage are researched. The formation of a new meaningful whole by relating fragments by montage is mentioned through movie examples related to the experience of spectator with the spatial experience created in the movie. Following the mechanical production, in the moment of encountering with the spectator, film is embodied by the reproduction of space and time in the body. Body, as a whole with its senses, muscles and memories, perceives the presented filmic space and time, and reproduces it as a new experience in itself. This experience enables the unseen in the film to be completed by the body and film to attain unity. By this way the cinematographic representation of the architectural space enables the representation to come into life by including the body in the production of space and time. ¬† In the final section the engagement of the space and time designed with cinematographic techniques with the spectatorial body is explained. Physical conditions of the film watching activity are examined within the scope of the projector, projecting light, projective surface. Later on, the experience of the spectator is analyzed on the basis of continuous perception and recollection, which is explained in the first section. This examination revealed that, at the moment of the spectatorial experience movie is no longer a mechanical production but a part of the body image. This condition is again held by the notion of embodiment. The embodiment of the film inside the spectator transforms the space and time presented in the film and ends with a brand new production by the spectatorial body. In the research the production done by the spectator is examined through the cinematographic techniques: long shot, deframe, pan and tilt, dolly and <b>dolly</b> <b>zoom.</b> These techniques are examined via the movies related, which include architectural space designs. The additional production done by the spectator to the cinematographic production is visualized through layered collages formed with architectural drawings, diagrams and screenshots taken from the related scenes. At the end of these examinations, the final experience produced by both the cinematographic production and the additions done by the spectatorial body is exhibited. Finally the potentials of these techniques on architectural representation are discussed. Y√ºksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
