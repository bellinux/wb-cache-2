5000|$|In 1994, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined [...] "gasoline gallon <b>equivalent</b> (<b>GGE)</b> means 5.660 {{pounds of}} natural gas." [...] Compressed natural gas (CNG), for example, is a gas {{rather than a}} liquid. It can be {{measured}} by its volume in standard cubic feet (ft³) (volume at atmospheric conditions), by its weight in pounds (lb) or by its energy content in joules (J) or British thermal units (BTU) or kilowatt-hours (kW·h). It is difficult to compare the cost of gasoline with other fuels if they are sold in different units. GGE solves this. One GGE of CNG and one GGE of electricity have exactly the same energy content as one gallon of gasoline. CNG sold at filling stations in the US is priced in dollars per GGE.|$|R

40|$|Identification and {{development}} of non-noble metal based electro-catalysts or electro-catalysts with significant reduction of expensive noble metal contents (E. g. IrO 2, Pt) with comparable electrochemical performance as the standard noble metal/metal oxide for proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis would constitute a major breakthrough in the generation of hydrogen by water electrolysis. Accomplishing such a system would not only result reduction of the overall capital costs of PEM based water electrolyzers, but also help attain the targeted hydrogen production cost [< 3. 0 / gallon gasoline <b>equivalent</b> (<b>gge)</b> ] comparable to conventional liquid fuels. In line with these goals, it was demonstrated that fluorine doped IrO 2 thin films and nanostructured high surface area powders display remarkably higher electrochemical activity, and comparable durability as pure IrO 2 electro-catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEM based water electrolysis.

30|$|Given the {{relatively}} rapid drop in PV costs in recent years, {{one might expect}} that electrolyzer costs would be the limiting factor in combined PV–electrolysis cells. Instead, a recent techno-economic analysis by Rodriguez et al. [45] demonstrates {{that the cost of}} hydrogen is largely defined by the PV component (which accounts for up to 97 % of the total cost) while materials selection for the electrolysis cell has only minor effects. This finding follows {{from the fact that the}} area of the PV array may need to be more than 100 times that of the electrolysis cell given the much lower current densities (< 10  mA/cm− 2) in unconcentrated solar cells as compared to electrolyzers, which can operate at current densities above 1  A cm− 2. As a consequence, PV cells operating with solar concentrators can be expected to lead to considerable cost savings. The authors estimate that optimized systems can achieve costs below $ 2.90 per kg of hydrogen produced, including compression and distribution costs [45]. This compares favorably with the U.S. Department of Energy’s stated goal of reducing the cost of hydrogen production to $ 2.00 –$ 4.00 per gallon of gasoline <b>equivalent</b> (<b>gge)</b> 8 delivered and dispensed by 2020 [30].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an integrated biorefinery process capable of producing multiple products is crucial for commercialization of microalgal biofuel production. Dilute acid pretreatment has been demonstrated as an efficient approach to utilize algal biomass more fully, by hydrolyzing microalgal carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, while making the lipids more extractable, and a protein fraction available for other products. Previously, we have shown that sugar-rich liquor could be separated from solid residue by solid–liquid separation (SLS) to produce ethanol via fermentation. However, process modeling has revealed that approximately 37 % of the soluble sugars {{were lost in the}} solid cake after the SLS. Herein, a Combined Algal Processing (CAP) approach with a simplified configuration has been developed to improve the total energy yield. In CAP, whole algal slurry after acid pretreatment is directly used for ethanol fermentation. The ethanol and microalgal lipids can be sequentially recovered from the fermentation broth by thermal treatment and solvent extraction. Almost all the monomeric fermentable sugars can be utilized for ethanol production without compromising the lipid recovery. The techno-economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the CAP can reduce microalgal biofuel cost by $ 0. 95 per gallon gasoline <b>equivalent</b> (<b>GGE),</b> which is a 9 % reduction compared to the previous biorefinery scenario...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmong {{the most}} {{formidable}} challenges to algal biofuels {{is the ability to}} harvest algae and extract intracellular lipids at low cost and with a positive energy balance. In this monograph, we construct two paradigms that contrast energy requirements and costs of conventional and cutting-edge Harvesting and Extraction (H&E) technologies. By application of the parity criterion and the moderate condition reference state, an energy–cost paradigm is created that allows 1 st stage harvesting technologies to be compared with easy reference to the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) target of $ 0. 013 /gallon of gasoline <b>equivalent</b> (<b>GGE)</b> and to the U. S. DOE's Bioenergy Technologies Office 2022 cost metrics. Drawing from the moderate condition reference state, a concentration-dependency paradigm is developed for extraction technologies, making easier comparison to the National Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap (NABTR) target of less than 10 % total energy. This monograph identifies cost-bearing factors for a variety of H&E technologies, describes a design basis for ultrasonic harvesters, and provides a framework to measure future technological advancements toward reducing H&E costs. Lastly, we show that ultrasonic harvesters and extractors are uniquely capable of meeting both NAABB and NABTR targets. Ultrasonic technologies require further development and scale-up before they can achieve low-cost performance at industrially relevant scales. However, the advancement of this technology would greatly reduce H&E costs and accelerate the commercial viability of algae-based biofuels...|$|R
40|$|Cultivation of {{filamentous}} fungi on corn-ethanol {{thin stillage}} {{has been proved}} to have a potential to create value-added products while reducing the COD, TSS, and other undesirable compounds in the thin stillage. However, inconsistencies in fungal growth yields hinder the commercial viability of large-scale fungal cultivation. The undesirable morphological growth of fungi overburdens the energy requirement for fungal cultivation while causing a poor mass transfer in the bioreactor. Morphological differences in fungal growth are influenced by various fermentation parameters. Lab-scale experiments on the cultivation of Rhizopus oligosporus on thin stillage were carried out to understand the effect of temperature and inoculum concentration {{in the production of}} optimum yields with pellet morphology. Production of renewable diesel from biocrude obtained via hydrothermal liquefaction of fungal biomass cultivated on thin stillage has been demonstrated. While the process seems to be a great way to produce second-generation biofuel, inconsistencies in fungal growth, and high-energy requirement encumbers the economics of the process for large-scale production. An early-stage techno-economic analysis was conducted to understand the key logjams in the commercialization of the process. The price of gasoline gallon <b>equivalent</b> (<b>GGE)</b> of the renewable diesel was obtained in practical and worst-case scenarios.

40|$|Beyond {{nutritional}} composition, food {{structure is}} increasingly recognized {{to play a}} role in food health potential, notably in satiety and glycemic responses. Food structure is also highly dependent on processing conditions. The hypothesis for this study is, based on a data set of 98 ready-to-eat foods, that the degree of food processing would correlate with the satiety index (SI) and glycemic response. Glycemic response was evaluated according to two indices: the glycemic index (GI) and a newly designed index, the glycemic glucose <b>equivalent</b> (<b>GGE).</b> The GGE indicates how a quantity of a certain food affects blood glucose levels by identifying the amount of food glucose that would have an effect equivalent to that of the food. Then, foods were clustered within three processing groups based on the international NOVA classification: (1) raw and minimally processed foods; (2) processed foods; and (3) ultra-processed foods. Ultra-processed foods are industrial formulations of substances extracted or derived from food and additives, typically with five or more and usually many (cheap) ingredients. The data were correlated by nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient on quantitative data. The main results show strong correlations between GGE, SI and the degree of food processing, while GI is not correlated with the degree of processing. Thus, the more food is processed, the higher the glycemic response and the lower its satiety potential. The study suggests that complex, natural, minimally and/or processed foods should be encouraged for consumption rather than highly unstructured and ultra-processed foods when choosing weakly hyperglycemic and satiating food...|$|R

40|$|The {{mission of}} the DOE's Fuel Cell Technologies'ÂHydrogen Fuels R&D effort is to research, develop, and {{validate}} technologies for producing, storing, and delivering hydrogen in an efficient, clean, safe, reliable, and affordable manner. A key program technical milestone for hydrogen technology readiness is to produce hydrogen from diverse, domestic resources at $ 2. 00 -$ 3. 00 per gallon of gasoline <b>equivalent</b> (<b>gge)</b> delivered, untaxed. Low-cost, high-temperature hydrogen separation membranes represent a key enabling technology for small-scale distributed hydrogen production units. Availability of such membranes with high selectivity and high permeability for hydrogen will allow their integration with hydrocarbon reforming and water gas shift reactions, potentially reducing the cost of hydrogen produced. Pd-metal-based dense membranes {{are known for their}} excellent hydrogen selectivity and permeability characteristics, however, utilization of these membranes has so far been limited to small scale niche markets for hydrogen purification primarily due to the relatively high cost of Pd-alloy tubes compared to pressure swing adsorption (PSA) units. This project was aimed at development of thin-film Pd-alloy membranes deposited on Pall Corporation's DOE-based AccuSepÂ® porous metal tube substrates to form a composite hydrogen separation membrane for these applications. Pall's composite membrane development addressed the typical limitations of composite structures by developing robust membranes capable of withstanding thermal and mechanical stresses resulting from high temperature (400 C), high pressure (400 psi steam methane reformer and 1000 psi coal) operations and thermal cycling involved in conventional hydrogen production. In addition, the Pd-alloy membrane composition was optimized to be able to offer the most stability in the typical synthesis gas environments produced by reforming of natural gas and bio-derived liquid fuels (BILI) validating the technical effectiveness and economic feasibility of the technology demonstrated.
