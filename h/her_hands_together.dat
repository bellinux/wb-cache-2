500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practices}} {{related to}} the placenta varied. [...] Some midwives believed the woman would pass the placenta faster if she blew with great force into her fist or clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> really tight (Encyclopedia). [...] Some women were encouraged {{to sit on a}} pot filled with hot water to pass the placenta faster. [...] Placentas were buried deep enough so that they could not be dug up by a human or an animal. [...] If the placenta were dug up, this would bring bad luck, illness, or death to the mother and child. [...] Sometimes the placenta were buried or disposed of in a stream of running water to prevent fever in the mother.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> {{strained}} <b>together</b> {{as if in}} {{resistance to}} an impulse of pleading; then she answered: [...] "Yes--but then, you see, it isn't really mine--it's the Captain's." ...|$|R
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} {{and stood by}} my table. She was sitting with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clasped <b>together,</b> looking into the fire. She looked very girlish and frail.|$|R

6000|$|Encouraged by {{a look in}} {{the young}} schoolmistress's eye, and putting <b>her</b> lilac-gloved <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> the fingers downward, between her knees, she went on, in a low voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is too much!' cried Isabel, {{recovering}} her utterance, {{and rising}} with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> locked <b>together</b> in <b>her</b> emotion. 'You make me repent my having lamented for it!' ...|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a little}} sobbing breath. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> were locked <b>together.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{say whether}} I {{should have done}} so--do!' she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> and frowning.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head. The child clapped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> uttered a wild shriek, and fell {{senseless}} at his feet.|$|E
60|$|Lady Summerhay, from whose comely face a frock, as it were, had slipped, clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> on the book.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, thank God {{for that}} `uttermost,'" [...] said the poor girl, {{clasping}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> quickly <b>together.</b> [...] "Oh, I understood that when He saved me, and I will trust to it now." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Gunnill put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> {{and a look}} of {{infinite}} long-suffering came upon her face, but she made no reply.|$|E

60|$|Eunice clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> {{under the}} table. It {{was what she}} had been expecting. She said so, in a {{monotonous}} voice.|$|E
60|$|Miss Adams, who {{had been}} frozen into silence during the long cold night, began to thaw now in the cheery warmth of the rising sun. She looked about her, and rubbed <b>her</b> thin <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ada hesitated, and clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly <b>together,</b> {{while the}} {{tell-tale}} blood rushed to her cheeks. Glumm, ever stupid on these matters, said no other word, but {{turned on his}} heel and strode quickly away.|$|R
6000|$|The teacher's {{pretty face}} was {{strained}} and white, and her wide-set eyes were painful to see. She set <b>her</b> slim <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b> [...] "Oh, I can't answer you now, but I {{know you are}} wrong--wickedly wrong!" ...|$|R

6000|$|The woman, {{looking very}} much ashamed, walked along by Christian; she kept rubbing <b>her</b> brown <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> and saying; [...] "Gracious lady, I {{would not have}} wished. It is heavy, but I would not have wished." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{went back}} to her seat, her eyes filled with a burning light, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{strained}} <b>together.</b> This great man from Madison had believed in her. O, if he would only come home and see her father! ...|$|R
