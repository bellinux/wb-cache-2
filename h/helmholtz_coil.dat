A new PEMF generator was designed to produce more homogeneous magnetic field than normal <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils.</b> The intensity and distribution of magnetic field y were calculated theoretically. The results showed that magnetic field generated by improved <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> (three identical coils) is more intensive and homogeneous than normal <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> (two identical coils). Moreover, this apparatus might {{play a significant role}} in the study of biological effects of PEMF on osteoporosis...|$|R

40|$|A {{changeable}} {{source of}} a uniform magnetic field is necessary for test and calibration of magnetometers. Often the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> is used for generating magnetic uniform field, but uniform field area generating by <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> is confined to a small volume in {{the centre of the}} coils. The calculation and modelling results of an axial 8 -coil system based on <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> is described, which enables a magnetic field with a no uniformity of not more than 0. 07 % to be produced at a distance of half the radius from the centre of the coil system...|$|R

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{magnetic}} field {{of a set of}} <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> designed to maintain a flat magnetic field in our plasma chamber. We show that the field of the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> is sufficiently large to correct for {{the magnetic field}} of the earth (approximately 50 µT) and probably other irregularities as well. We also show that the field is sufficiently flat to distinguish a Be plasma from a Li plasma using FTICR with a central field of 0. 43 T in the plasma chamber. This requires the field created by the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> to be uniform to within about 60 µT. The standard deviation of a 630 µT field produced by the coils was found to be approximately 30 µT...|$|R

30|$|Among the {{researches}} {{of magnetic}} controlled microrobots, Bradley J. Nelson's group, {{inspired by the}} natural design of bacterial flagella, proposed an artificial bacterial flagella microrobot [14] that could swim in a controllable fashion using weak applied magnetic fields. The flagella microrobot consisted of a helical tail and a small soft magnetic material as a head on one end. The flagella microrobot's helical propulsion could be precisely controlled by electromagnetic coils. They also proposed porous microniches using 3 D laser lithography as a transporting microrobot for targeted cell delivery [15]. Metin Sitti proposed a microrobot driven by magnetic torque. It could be controlled by two pairs of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> {{and a pair of}} clamping coils with a stick-slip motion [16]. The horizontal movement was controlled by the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils,</b> and the clamping coils made the driving signals for the stick-slip motion. Sukho Park proposed a kind of microrobot controlled by magnetic force. The driving system consisted of two pairs of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> and two pairs of Maxwell coils [17]. The magnetic force was provided by the Maxwell <b>coils,</b> and the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> were used to generate the torque for the rotation of the microrobot. However, in manipulating microrobots to explore the human body, {{there are still a lot}} of works that need to be done.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> is {{a device}} for {{producing}} {{a region of}} nearly uniform magnetic field, named after the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. It consists of two solenoid electromagnets on the same axis. Besides creating magnetic fields, Helmholtz coils are also used in scientific apparatus to cancel external magnetic fields, such as the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|Generation, {{distribution}} {{and use of}} electrical energy is necessarily combined with low frequency electromagnetical radiation. At workplaces and in domestic environments electromagnetic fields are regarded as ''important environmental polutants''. Research is focusing on dose-response relationships, epidemiological investigations and potential therapeutical use of low frequency electromagnetic fields. In all of these investigations {{the knowledge of the}} magnetic field strength is necessary, in many cases derived from measurements. When developing suitable field sensors and/or measurement instrumentation well known magnetic test and calibration fields are necessary. In many cases <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> can provide these magnetic fields with sufficient homogenity. Based on the Biot-Savart-law three dimensional magnetic fields of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> have been analytically described and coil parameters as inductivity and resonant frequency have been calculated. As a calibration device for low frequency magnetic sensors a three dimensional set of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> has been set up and tested. (orig.) 47 refs.

50|$|Fine Beam Tube Method: A heater heats a cathode, which emits {{electrons}}. The electrons are accelerated {{through a}} known potential, so {{the velocity of}} the electrons is known. The beam path can be seen when the electrons are accelerated through a helium (He) gas. The collisions between the electrons and the helium gas produce a visible trail. A pair of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> produces a uniform and measurable magnetic field {{at right angles to}} the electron beam. This magnetic field deflects the electron beam in a circular path. By measuring the accelerating potential (volts), the current (amps) to the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils,</b> and the radius of the electron beam, e/m can be calculated.|$|R

The MR loops of MR sensors can be obtained with the instrument using two-point probe measurement and four-point probe measurement. Two pairs of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> can supply a hard-axis magnetic field and a soft-axis magnetic field for the sensor. The single MTJ sensor and MTJs array sensor in Wheatstone bridge were characterized and compared here. The influence of hard-bias magnetic field on MR transfer curves of sing MTJ sensor and MTJs array sensor are investigated. The corresponding optimal hard-axis magnetic fields were obtained through <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> to eliminate the hysteresis for linear response of single MTJ sensor and MTJs array sensor...|$|R
50|$|In some {{designs of}} quadrupoles using electromagnets, {{there are four}} steel pole tips: two {{opposing}} magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles. The steel is magnetized by a large electric current in the coils of tubing wrapped around the poles. Another design is a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> layout but with the current {{in one of the}} coils reversed.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetizing}} {{field is}} {{applied for a}} sufficient time to allow the NP dipole moment to reach its maximum value. This field is then rapidly turned off > 1 msec, followed by a short duration to allow for any induced currents from the magnetizing field pulse to die away. Following this, the sensors are turned on and measure the decaying field for a sufficient time to obtain an accurate value of the decay time constant; 1 - 3 s. Magnetizing fields of ~5 mT for a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> of 1 m in diameter are used.|$|E
50|$|Except for microwave, the {{detection}} rate {{for all these}} tags depends on their orientation relative to {{the detection}} loops. For a pair of planar loops forming a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil,</b> magnetic field lines will be approximately parallel in their center. Orienting the tag so that no magnetic flux from the coils crosses them will prevent detection, as the tag won't be coupled to the coils. This shortcoming, documented in the first EAS patents, can be solved by using multiple coils or by placing them in another arrangement such as a figure-of-eight. Sensitivity will still be orientation-dependent but detection will be possible at all orientations.|$|E

5000|$|A gradient-field Maxwell coil is {{essentially}} the same geometry of the 3-coil configuration above, with the central coil removed to leave only the smaller two coils. If the current in one of the coils is reversed, a uniform-gradient magnetic field is produced near the centre of the two coils. Maxwell describes the use of the 2-coil configuration for the generation of a uniform force on a small test coil. A Maxwell coil of this type is similar to a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> with the coil distance increased from coil radius [...] to [...] and the coils fed with opposite currents.|$|E
50|$|Most Helmholtz coils use DC (direct) {{current to}} produce a static {{magnetic}} field. Many applications and experiments require a time-varying magnetic field. These applications include magnetic field susceptibility tests, scientific experiments, and biomedical studies (the interaction between magnetic field and living tissue). The required magnetic fields are usually either pulse or continuous sinewave. The magnetic field frequency range can be anywhere from near DC (0 Hz) to many kilohertz or even megahertz (MHz). An AC <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> driver is needed to generate the required time-varying magnetic field. The waveform amplifier driver {{must be able to}} output high AC current to produce the magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|In 1927 Fanselau {{started work}} at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Berlin and the {{following}} year moved to the Magnetic Observatory, led by Adolf Schmidt. The first few years he was engaged {{in the construction of}} the observatory in Niemegk. The electrification of the Berlin Stadtbahn disturbed geomagnetic observations in Potsdam and Seddin. In 1929 he developed the Fanselau coil, a modified version of the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil,</b> which uses a special arrangement of coils to improve the homogeneity of the generated magnetic field. In 1933 he became head of the observatory at Niemegk. In 1935 he qualified as a professor of geophysics in Berlin, and in 1941 he commenced a teaching position there. In 1940 he joined the Nazi Party.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnetic}} bottle {{has the same}} structure as <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils,</b> but with the magnets separated further apart so that the field expands in the middle, trapping charged particles with the diverging field lines. If one coil is reversed, it produces a cusp trap, which also traps charged particles.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the above}} {{limitations}} of passive shielding, an alternative used with static or low-frequency fields is active shielding; using a field created by electromagnets to cancel the ambient field within a volume. [...] Solenoids and <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> are types of coils {{that can be used}} for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{configuration}} of the double <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coils</b> for measuring of the magnetic dipole moments was defined. It was determined that measuring coils should have round shape and compensative coils – the square one.

50|$|Generating {{a static}} {{magnetic}} field is relatively easy; {{the strength of the}} field is proportional to the current. Generating a high-frequency magnetic field is more challenging. The coils are inductors, and their impedance increases proportionally with frequency. To provide the same field intensity at twice the frequency requires twice the voltage across the coil. Instead of directly driving the coil with a high voltage, a series resonant circuit may be used to provide the high voltage. A series capacitor is added in series with the coils. The capacitance is chosen to resonate the coil at the desired frequency. Only the coils parasitic resistance is remained. This method only works at frequencies close to the resonant frequency; to generate the field at other frequencies requires different capacitors. The <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> resonant frequency, , and capacitor value, C, are given below.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} PEMF devices {{consisted of}} a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil</b> which generated a magnetic field. The patient's body was placed inside the magnetic field to deliver treatment. Today, the majority of PEMF wellness devices resemble a typical yoga mat in dimensions but are slightly thicker to house several flat spiral coils to produce an even electromagnetic field.

A wide variety of professional and consumer PEMF devices are sold and marketed as FDA registered wellness devices. The majority are manufactured in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and are imported into North America as electric massagers or full body electric yoga mats.

In 1925 he received a doctorate in engineering and completed his habilitation in theoretical physics the following year at the University of Stuttgart, where he continued as a lecturer. In 1932 Braunbeck became Associate Professor at the University of Stuttgart, before replacing Alfred Landé in 1936 as Professor of theoretical physics at the University of Tübingen, and succeeding to the role of Professor in 1959. In 1961/62 he served as Dean of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of the University of Tübingen. In 1934 Braunbeck developed the Braunbek coil, a modified <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>coil.</b> In 1939, he disproved Earnshaw's theorem by showing that there are magnetic fields in which small diamagnetic bodies can float in a stable position.
