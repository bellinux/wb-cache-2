25|$|In 2005, {{with the}} {{approach}} of Hurricane Katrina, storm surge funneled by {{the confluence of the}} GIWW's and MRGO's levees created multiple breaches in the canal's concrete floodwalls, including the spectacular failure of a quarter-mile length on the Lower 9th Ward side, resulting in catastrophic flooding. On the Upper 9th Ward side, the canal poured through a breach near Florida Avenue. On the opposite side, there were two breaches between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. A large barge, the ING 4727, floated through the breach closer to the river and was deposited in the Lower 9th Ward. The barge itself may have caused {{one or more of the}} breaches; this possibility is under investigation. The canal lock was functioning two days after Katrina hit, at first mostly for barges bringing <b>in</b> <b>fill</b> to repair the breaches. A month later Hurricane Rita reflooded recently drained areas along the canal by topping emergency fill at the breach sites.|$|E

500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' {{takes place in a}} world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are {{trying to find a way}} to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those <b>in</b> <b>Fill</b> the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E
500|$|In general, Sudry {{designed}} the visual effects <b>in</b> <b>Fill</b> the Void {{to create a}} claustrophobic view point. Blurred backgrounds were often utilized {{to focus on the}} faces of the characters, and most of the long takes were shot from an interior perspective. Sudry used Arri Alexa cameras and short-range lenses with limited camera movements to maintain the effect. Burshtein explained that this was done to illustrate that [...] "the heart is very colorful and very small" [...] and that [...] "we as human beings only see fragments of the big picture; God sees the whole thing!" [...] While a [...] "documentary feel" [...] was retained throughout most the film's duration, the style was switched for the wedding scene to create a euphoric atmosphere similar to those used in productions by Terrence Malick and David Lynch.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating <b>in</b> <b>Fill</b> the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{liquid crystal}} director-colloidal {{particle}} surface interaction <b>in</b> <b>filled</b> liquid crystals causes the thermally-induced director fluctuation correlations to be screened. This {{is consistent with}} the experimentally observed reduction in the thermal director fluctuation-induced Rayleigh light scattering <b>in</b> <b>filled</b> liquid crystals. The colloid-mesogen interaction also induces director non-uniformity <b>in</b> <b>filled</b> liquid crystals, thus further modifying the spatial dependence of the director fluctuation conelations, and shifts the critical temperature at which the isotropic phase loses its stability with respect to nematic fluctuations. The shift is specifically particle-size dependent, and this will enable the phenomenon to be recognized experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Incompleteness and inaccuracy, in filing {{medical records}} brings bad {{impact on the}} health service to the patient, because {{the time for the}} {{registration}} process to medical action taken become longer. Besides, the analysis of previous medical history and medical action that had been done can not be done correctly either, due to incomplete data on the patient's medical record. Referring to the problems found in the study site, the formulation of the research problem is "How to improve the performance of physicians <b>in</b> the <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical record?" Deep observations in the study and review of the results of previous studies have led researchers to examine the effect of satisfaction with the job, satisfaction with the salary, satisfaction with the superior, satisfaction with the coworkers, and satisfaction with the promotion opportunities variables on the performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records. Statistical tests of the empirical data, we obtained five conclusions, namely: the satisfaction with the job proved to {{have a significant effect on}} performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records, satisfaction with the salary shown to have a significant effect on the performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records, satisfaction with the superior proved to have a significant effect on the performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records, satisfaction with the coworkers proved to have a significant effect on the performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records, and satisfaction with the promotion opportunities proved to have a significant effect on the performance of physicians <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> the outpatient’s medical records. ...|$|R

500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played <b>in</b> <b>Fill</b> the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{are certain}} {{remarkable}} women in all countries who, whatever sphere {{they may be}} seen <b>in,</b> <b>fill</b> that sphere as completely as a great actor fills the stage. Widow Fontaine {{was one of these}} noteworthy persons. The wretched little room seemed to disappear when she softly glided into it; and even the pretty Minna herself receded into partial obscurity in her mother's presence. And yet {{there was nothing in the}} least obtrusive in the manner of Madame Fontaine, and nothing remarkable in her stature. Her figure, reaching to no more than the middle height, was the well-rounded figure of a woman approaching forty years of age. The influence she exercised was, in part, attributable, as I suppose, to the supple grace of all her movements; in part, to the commanding composure of her expression and the indescribable witchery of her manner. Her dark eyes, never fully opened in my remembrance, looked at me under heavy overhanging upper eyelids. Her enemies saw something sensual in their strange expression. To my mind it was rather something furtively cruel--except when she looked at her daughter. Sensuality shows itself most plainly in the excessive development of the lower part of the face. Madame Fontaine's lips were thin, and her chin was too small. Her profuse black hair was just beginning to be streaked with gray. Her complexion wanted color. In spite of these drawbacks, she was still a striking, I might almost say a startling, creature, when you first looked at her. And, though she only wore the plainest widow's weeds, I don't scruple to assert that she was the most perfectly dressed woman I ever saw.|$|E

40|$|Chronic (8 weeks) {{coronary}} artery ligation caused marked left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD) in rabbits. The positive inotropic effect observed in vivo with intraventricular injection of saline in sham-operated (control) animals was reversed in rabbits with LVD. In vitro, a step increase <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure from 10 to 15 cmH(2) O caused an immediate increase, {{followed by a}} slow increase, in left-ventricular peak systolic pressure (LVPmax) and cardiac output (CO) over 5 - 7 min in sham-operated hearts.

Progressive increases <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure increased (LVPmax) and CO to a maximum value at 20 cmH(2) O in control hearts. In the LVD group, progressive increases <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure caused a negative inotropic response and reduced CO. Hearts from the LVD group were significantly dilated compared with control hearts but no significant changes in myocardial compliance were observed in beating or quiescent hearts. These studies reveal an impaired inotropic response to increased ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> LVD rabbit hearts; this defect included the depression of the slow inotropic response to an increased end-diastolic volume. These changes appear not to be accompanied by altered passive mechanical properties...|$|R
