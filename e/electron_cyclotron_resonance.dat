25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E

Initial EBE measurements in H-mode plasmas exhibited strong emission before the L-H transition, but the emission rapidly decayed after the transition.

40|$|Magnetically {{confined}} plasma can be heated {{with high}} power microwave sources. In spherical torus the {{electron plasma frequency}} exeeds the <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> frequency (EC) and, as a consequence, electromagnetic waves at fundamental and low harmonic EC cannot propagate within the plasma. In contrast, electron Bernstein waves (EBWs) readily propagate in spherical torus plasma and are absorbed strongly at the <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances.</b> In order to proagate EBWs beyond the upper hybrid resonance (UHR), that surrounds the plasma, the EBWs must convert via one of two processes to either ordinary (O-mode) or extraordinary (X-mode) electromagnetic waves. O-mode and X-mode electromagnetic waves lunched at the plasma edge can convert to the electron Bernstein waves (EBWs) which can propagate without and cut-off into {{the core of the}} plasma and damp on electrons. Since the electron Bernstein wave (EBW) has no cut-off limits, it is well suited to heat an over-dense plasma by resonant absorption. An important problem is to calculate mode conversion coefficient that is very sensitive to density. Mode conversion coefficient depends on Budden parameter (Ã±) and density scale length (Ln) in upper hybrid resonance (UHR).

40|$|The {{interaction}} of dense plasmas with an intense laser under a strong {{external magnetic field}} has been investigated. When the cyclotron frequency for the ambient magnetic field {{is higher than the}} laser frequency, the laser's electromagnetic field is converted to the whistler mode that propagates along the field line. Because {{of the nature of the}} whistler wave, the laser light penetrates into dense plasmas with no cutoff density, and produces superthermal <b>electrons</b> through <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance.</b> It is found that the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> absorption occurs effectively under the broadened conditions, or a wider range of the external field, which is caused by the presence of relativistic electrons accelerated by the laser field.

40|$|We briefly {{describe}} {{some results}} of our ongoing study of Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) bursts with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. We have detected evidence of <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> absorption features from the SGR 1806 - 20 in the spectrum of a long, complex precursor that preceded a strong burst. The observation is made by the analysis of data from the RXTE. The features consist of a narrow 5. 0 keV absorption line together with modulation near its second and third harmonics (at 11. 2 keV and 17. 5 keV respectively). The line features are transient and are detected in the harder radiation part of the precursor. The 5. 0 keV feature is strong, with an equivalent width of approximately 500 eV and a narrow width of less than 0. 4 keV. Interpreting the features as <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> lines {{in the context of}} accretion models leads to a large mass radius ratio (M/R greater than 0. 3 M sun/km) that is inconsistent with neutron stars or that requires a low (5 - 7) x l 0 (exp 11) G magnetic field that is unlikely for SGRs. The line widths are also narrow compared with those of <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> observed so far in X-ray pulsars. In the magnetar picture, the features are plausibly explained as ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> in an ultra-strong magnetic field that have recently been predicted from magnetar candidates. In this view, the 5. 0 keV feature is consistent with a proton cyclotron fundamental whose energy and width are close to model predictions.

40|$|ABBREVIATED) We {{consider}} {{the structure of}} neutron star magnetospheres threaded by large-scale electrical currents, {{and the effect of}} resonant Compton scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the emergent X-ray spectra and pulse profiles. In the magnetar model for the SGRs and AXPs, these currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the star. We construct self-similar, force-free equilibria of the current-carrying magnetosphere with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius, B r^(- 2 -p), and show that a large-scale twist softens the radial dependence to p < 1. The spindown torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison with a vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the surface magnetic field in the SGR and AXP sources, and the implications of this model for the narrow measured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a strong twist, B_Ï/B_Î¸ = O(1) at the equator, has an optical depth 1 to resonant cyclotron scattering, independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field strength, or charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and ions supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting charges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and AXP sources, if B_dipole 10 ^ 14 G. Redistribution of the emerging X-ray flux at the ion and <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> will significantly modify the emerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a non-thermal tail to the X-ray spectrum. The sudden change in the pulse profile of SGR 1900 + 14 after the 27 August 1998 giant flare is related to an enhanced optical depth to <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> scattering, resulting from a sudden twist imparted to the external magnetic field.
