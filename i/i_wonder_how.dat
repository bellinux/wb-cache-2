500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} viewed {{by an average}} of 2.49 million American viewers on its {{original}} broadcast, ranking 108 out of 112 in the weekly charts. Debra Leithauser and Amy Amatangelo of The Washington Post praised the pilot for relying [...] "on strong storytelling and casting", but hoped that viewers would be able to follow the multiple storylines. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was [...] "so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story so filled with great dialogue that <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment." [...] He said that the protagonist [...] "has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense." [...] He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had [...] "comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together", and said that [...] "if future episodes are half as good, this still will be one of TV's bright spots". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness".|$|E
500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

2500|$|Sachs {{himself said}} that the {{nomination}} was: [...] "a bit of a surprise", and that: [...] "One would question the reasons when it comes so quickly after what happened. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> much {{it has to do}} with trying to comfort him.

2500|$|On {{the dial}} you could crank {{it up to}} 140 volts or down to zero. So I figured, if it’s on 220 and it’s that quiet, if I take the voltage and lower it, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> low I can go and it still work. Well, it enabled me to turn my amp all the way up, save the tubes, save {{the wear and tear}} on the tubes, and play at clubs at half the volume. So, my Variac, my {{variable}} transformer was my volume knob. Too loud, [...] I’d lower it down to 50.|$|E
2500|$|Before Gresham {{began his}} long career in outdoor journalism, {{he signed a}} {{baseball}} contract with the Chicago Cubs organization {{and was on the}} roster of the Cubs' Shelby, North Carolina farm team but never played. His son, Tom Gresham, learned of the baseball offer from the Cubs several years after his father's death while looking through old family records. [...] "He went to work {{to take care of his}} young family ... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> much it hurt him to make that decision. So much that he never, ever told us he was signed by the Cubs." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> hard {{he is prepared to}} work at his batting at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|With Pawsey's help, £630,000 {{was raised}} from the Ford Foundation {{to build the}} Culgoora radio-{{heliograph}}. Years later he was to admit [...] "When I think back <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> I {{had the nerve to}} do it." [...] The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing a huge amount of data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
2500|$|It {{says in the}} Akathist that St. Herman envisioned [...] "an Episcopal throne in this land." [...] (Ikos 11) It doesn't say {{anything}} about multiple thrones, but onean autocephalous Church in this landone {{that came to be}} in 1970 [...] [...] I look back on those seminary years and years later when there was much hope for a united church in America. [...] There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. [...] Now we look back just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! [...] <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. [...] Even Ligonier was hopeful {{to those of us who}} were serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions. [...] Soon we were disappointed when hierarchs removed their names from the documents that were prepared; one on evangelism and the other on administrative unity.|$|E

60|$|At {{intervals}} <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{what had}} become of Bradshaw. I was not surprised at his absence. At first I had feared that he would keep his word in that matter.
