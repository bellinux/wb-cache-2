500|$|Sophie Blanchard {{was born}} Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little {{is known of}} her life before her {{marriage}} to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 [...] or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's [...] "small, ugly, nervous wife", [...] "small with sharp bird-like features" [...] and later as [...] "small and beautiful", Sophie was more {{at home in the}} sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. She was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a <b>joint</b> <b>flight</b> in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.|$|E
2500|$|The group passed cosmonauts {{examinations}} 28 November 1962 and {{was put on}} hold {{until the}} end of April 1963. Preparation to the flight was impossible without a firmly set launch date, and nobody in the government dared to give a go-ahead. On 24 April, the government finally ordered a <b>joint</b> <b>flight</b> of two available Vostok spacecraft - the only two craft in stock. Their shelf life was set at 15 June 1963 and could not be extended. Thus, the flight preparation of Valery Bykovsky and Valentina Tereshkova (approved to fly 21 May) was hurried by [...] "use it or lose it" [...] deadline. Kamanin and the cosmonauts relocated to Baikonur 27 May and stayed there until the launch. In fact, Tereshkova lifted off 16 June - one day past her craft's expiration date. Kamanin worked mission control shifts while she was in space and had to wake Tereshkova who, asleep, failed to respond. Both crafts landed safely but overshot the landing target by two degrees. Like Gagarin, Tereshkova bailed from the landing capsule and used her personal parachute. After the flight, Kamanin again was involved in a time-consuming publicity campaign - this time, centered around Tereshkova.|$|E

5000|$|The Air Service {{personnel}} were established at Weissenthurm, south of Coblenz on the Rhine River. A new aerodrome was established, and some Bessonneau hangars were erected and quarters were established for personnel and offices.

[...] In March 1921, Army Engineers had erected facilities on the airfield and the Americans were moved to the airfield from the temporary facilities they occupied in the town during the winter. Occupation duties included all sorts and types of flying, such as test flights, phots of radio telegraph and radio telephone missions, <b>joint</b> <b>flights</b> with infantry, cavalry and artillery units during the winter and spring maneuvers, cross country flights and passenger carrying.

50|$|Early {{concepts}} for a <b>joint</b> <b>flight</b> included docking a Soyuz {{craft to}} the American Skylab space station, or an Apollo vehicle docking with a Salyut space station.

40|$|When envisioning {{the future}} of the UAV’s, they are placed on a privileged {{position}} to execute aerial missions of surveillance and recognition, amongst others with high relevance and danger that were until nowadays executed by humans due to their expertise and intelligence. Nevertheless the task to fulfill this capability and meet the expectations requires a high level of autonomous capability from these systems.
