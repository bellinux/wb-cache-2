5|$|Downey {{was able}} to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's <b>insurance</b> <b>bond</b> for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.

50|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>insurance</b> {{generally}} {{reduces the}} borrowing costs for an issuer since investors {{are prepared to}} accept a lower interest rate {{in exchange for the}} credit enhancement provided by the <b>bond</b> <b>insurance.</b> The interest savings from the use of <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> are generally shared between the issuer (as its incentive to use the insurance) and the insurer (as its premium for providing the insurance). Since an issuer generally has the option of selling its securities with or without insurance, the issuer will generally only use insurance when doing so results in overall cost savings acceptable to the issuer. Municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are generally paid up-front as a lump sum; while non-municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are generally paid in periodic installments over time.|$|R

50|$|With these requirements, teen dances {{outside of}} schools were {{virtually}} {{banned in the}} city, as no promoter would undertake the costs involved.

In addition to the $1 million <b>insurance</b> <b>bond,</b> hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. Ironically the non-profit exemption meant the ordinance {{did not apply to}} the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing civil abatement laws.

50|$|Several Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec) {{provide a}} public auto {{insurance}} system {{while in the}} rest of the country insurance is provided privately party insurance is privatized in Quebec and is mandatory. The province covers everything but the vehicle(s). Basic auto insurance is mandatory throughout Canada with each province's government determining which benefits are included as minimum required auto insurance coverage and which benefits are options available for those seeking additional coverage. Accident benefits coverage is mandatory everywhere except for Newfoundland and Labrador. All provinces in Canada have some form of no-fault insurance available to accident victims. The difference from province to province is the extent to which tort or no-fault is emphasized. International drivers entering Canada are permitted to drive any vehicle their licence allows for the 3-month period for which they are allowed to use their international licence. International laws provide visitors to the country with an International <b>Insurance</b> <b>Bond</b> (IIB) until this 3-month period is over in which the international driver must provide themselves with Canadian Insurance. The IIB is reinstated every time the international driver enters the country. Damage to the driver's own vehicle is optional - one notable exception to this is in Saskatchewan, where SGI provides collision coverage (less than a $1000 deductible, such as a collision damage waiver) as part of its basic insurance policy. In Saskatchewan, residents have the option to have their auto insurance through a tort system but less than 0.5% of the population have taken this option.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{mortgage}} <b>insurance,</b> <b>bond</b> insurance generally {{provides for}} unconditional payment of claims, although the insurer reserves {{the right to}} pursue contractual or other available remedies. As a result, the bond insurers were faced with {{billions of dollars of}} claims to insured security holders associated with their exposure to RMBS following the financial crisis, with uncertain prospects for recoveries from the sponsors of the securitizations giving rise to those claims. One indication of the extent of loan quality misrepresentation was the settlement in 2011 between Assured Guaranty and Bank of America, which had purchased mortgage originator Countrywide. Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America made a $1.1 billion payment to Assured Guaranty and agreed to cover 80% of up to $6.6 billion of Assured Guaranty’s future paid losses from breaches of representations and warranties on 21 insured RMBS transactions. [...] Subsequently, in 2013, in the first R&W trial to reach a judgment, Flagstar Bank was required to compensate Assured Guaranty in full for past and future claims. The amounts that Assured Guaranty caused R&W providers to pay or commit to pay through putbacks and settlements plus the amount of future projected losses that Assured Guaranty avoided through negotiated terminations totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2015. While the widespread misrepresentations caused bond insurers to experience considerable losses on insured securities backed by residential mortgage loans (including first lien loans, second lien loans, and home equity lines of credit), the most severe losses were experienced by those monolines that insured CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Although the bond insurers generally insured such CDOs at very high attachment points or collateral levels (with underlying ratings of triple-A), those bond insurers and the rating agencies failed to anticipate the correlation of performance of the underlying securities. Specifically, these bond insurers and rating agencies relied upon historical data that did not prove predictive of residential mortgage loan performance following the 2008 crisis, which witnessed the first-ever nationwide decline in housing prices. Notably, AGM and AGC did not insure such CDOs, which has allowed Assured Guaranty to continue writing business throughout the financial crisis and ensuing recession and recovery.|$|E
