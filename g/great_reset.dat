50|$|Florida {{claims the}} 1870s reset best mirrors the American {{economic}} {{situation in the}} 2010s. The 1870s changed the organization of production, creating the American system of manufacturing, which {{paved the way for}} unprecedented growth and innovation. During the first <b>great</b> <b>reset</b> there was a mass migration of people from the countryside to urban areas, and significant development of new transportation structures.|$|E
5000|$|The second <b>great</b> <b>reset</b> laid {{our current}} foundation. Florida cites {{historian}} Alexander Field, calling the Great Depression of the 1930s, the [...] "most technologically progressive" [...] {{time of the}} 20th century. The second reset, {{through a combination of}} public policy, economic incentives, and a shift in social preferences started the move towards suburbs. Consumption habits were significantly altered as people spent less on basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing and began to spend more on appliances and other household items. The second reset created the [...] "ownership society"; our new economic model is more dynamic and will require increased flexibility.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Meter-scale {{submarine}} cavities in Middle Cambrian shelf-margin microbial reef strata indicate large-scale dewatering processes, {{in conjunction}} with substrate instability related to interreef channeling and shelf-edge downslope creep and slip. Syndepositional cement pre-cipitation within the cavities preserved delicate microbial fabrics and stabilized the reef system. Radiaxial fibrous calcite and herringbone calcite cements line the cavity interiors isopachously. The two phases cannot be discriminated {{on the basis of}} Fe, Mn, or Sr contents, but do have different isotopic signatures. Slightly more negative d 13 C values in herringbone calcite suggest that abrupt transitions between radiaxial fibrous and herringbone calcite cement are the result of rapid and repeated changes in pore-fluid oxygen levels. Storm-driven pore-water circulation renewed oxygenated seawater flow into the cavities, result-ing in precipitation of radiaxial fibrous calcite. A threshold level of oxygen reduction resulted in the change to herringbone calcite precip-itation. The pore fluids associated with herringbone calcite did not have elevated Mn or Fe concentrations, as suggested in previous studies. Herringbone calcite appears to be more susceptible to diagenetic al-teration than radiaxial fibrous cement however, as indicated by <b>greater</b> <b>resetting</b> of oxygen isotope values...|$|R
40|$|Theta reset, {{in which}} the rhythmic firing of neurons stops and then restarts to the onset of a stimulus, is {{believed}} to improve encoding and retrieval of stimuli by causing stimuli to be time-locked to waves of depolarization in the HPC. Recent research by Williams et al. (in preparation) has demonstrated that, in rats, theta reset occurs 1) in several cortical areas including the anterior cingulate (AC), 2) occurs during different phases of a working memory task for different cortical areas, and 3) can be predictive of working memory task performance. In the current study, human participants received EEG recording of the AC while performing a working memory task. Participants viewed {{a picture of a}} random dot arrangement for four seconds (encoding), viewed a blank screen for eight seconds {{in which the}} dots disappeared (delay), and viewed a second picture that was either the same or slightly different from the previous picture (retrieval). Participants decided if the second picture was the same or different and then made a choice on a response box. While no significant main effects were revealed, several trends were present. <b>Greater</b> theta <b>reset</b> occurred during the encoding phase of the task for participants who were high in overall accuracy than those who were low in accuracy for midline recording. In contrast, <b>greater</b> theta <b>reset</b> occurred during the retrieval phase for those who were low in accuracy than those who were high in accuracy for midline recording. <b>Greater</b> theta <b>reset</b> occurred in the retrieval phase of the task for both left and right AC recording. It is possible that increased focus on encoding stimuli, visible by an increase in theta reset, caused better encoding and, consequently, better accuracy for these participants. Lower accuracy may have resulted from misplaced focus on the retrieval stimulus (as evidenced by an increase in theta reset) instead of the encoding stimulus. This study provides insight into the role of theta reset in the memory functioning of the AC of humans...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown in animal studies that {{exposure}} to brief pulses of bright light can phase shift the circadian pacemaker and that the resetting action of light is most efficient during the first minutes of light exposure. In humans, multiple consecutive days of exposure to brief bright light pulses have been shown to phase shift the circadian pacemaker. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether a single sequence of brief bright light pulses administered during the early biological night would phase delay the human circadian pacemaker. Twenty-one healthy young subjects underwent a 6. 5 -h light exposure session in one of three randomly assigned conditions: 1) continuous bright light of approximately 9, 500 lux, 2) intermittent bright light (six 15 -min bright light pulses of approximately 9, 500 lux separated by 60 min of very dim light of < 1 lux), and 3) continuous very dim light of < 1 lux. Twenty subjects were included in the analysis. Core body temperature (CBT) and melatonin were used as phase markers of the circadian pacemaker. Phase delays of CBT and melatonin rhythms in response to intermittent bright light pulses were comparable to those measured after continuous bright light exposure, even though the total exposure to the intermittent bright light represented only 23 % of the 6. 5 -h continuous exposure. These results demonstrate that a single sequence of intermittent bright light pulses can phase delay the human circadian pacemaker and show that intermittent pulses have a <b>greater</b> <b>resetting</b> efficacy on a per minute basis than does continuous exposure...|$|R
50|$|The Great Reset: How New Ways of Living and Working Drive Post-Crash Prosperity {{is a book}} {{published}} in April 2010 by Richard Florida, {{a professor at the}} University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. The book puts into context Florida's urban development theories, with the recent recession, to describe the future of our cities.The <b>Great</b> <b>Reset</b> looks at the economic incentives which have driven American society in the past. Florida compares the 2008-2012 global recession to two similar periods in recent history, the 1870s and the 1930s. The book is divided into three parts, how past resets have shaped development, how different cities are positioned, and what trends will emerge from the reset.|$|E
50|$|This section {{examines}} {{the potential impact}} that the recession and the reset will have on different types of cities. The higher a city's exposure to the creative economy, the better it will do in the <b>great</b> <b>reset.</b> Cities like London and New York City, despite their exposure to the financial industry, have the diversity and global reach to prosper. Cities that are major or regional hubs will also thrive as they become the beneficiary of increased consolidation. Smaller cities heavy on particular aspects of the economy, for example those overly exposed to manufacturing or the FIRE economy (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) will need to adjust their economic model and demographics. Government and college towns will prosper because {{of their ability to}} attract and maintain members of the creative class.|$|E
40|$|Like the Great Depression and the Long Depression before it, {{experts have}} viewed {{prolonged}} economic downturns as crises. In The <b>Great</b> <b>Reset,</b> bestselling author Richard Florida argues {{that we should}} instead see the recent recession {{as an opportunity to}} create entirely new ways of working and living - and new economic practices that are more sustainable than current systems. Studying successful examples from the past, Florida surmises that for a reset to work, it must move beyond the limited realm of companies, business models, innovations, even public policies. It must be a rethinking of our very way of life in which we recreate and redefine the geography of capitalism. Combining academic research, real life vignettes, and historical examples, Florida identifies the four major pillars of the reset, explaining how each will lead to transformation, opportunity, and new prosperity, including: flexible housing; new and faster public transportation; more affordable consumption bundles such as food and energy; and, new jobs, industries, and sources of innovation. Going beyond economics and social geography, The <b>Great</b> <b>Reset</b> provides a new framework for understanding the roots of new growth, details the essential actions for recovery; shows the often-overlooked importance of place; and, paints a picture of what our new lives could soon look like...|$|E
40|$|Although {{exhumation}} {{and surface}} uplift are important parameters in understanding orogenesis, {{the opportunity to}} measure both in close proximity is rare. In Timor-Leste (East Timor), deeply exhumed metamorphic rocks and piggyback deepwater synorogenic basins are only tens of kilometers apart, permitting direct relation of uplift and exhumation by comparing micropaleontology to thermochronology interpreted through one-dimensional thermal modeling. Foraminifera in two deepwater synorogenic basins suggest basin uplift from depths of 1 - 2 â€‰km to depths of 350 - 1000 â€‰m between 3. 35 and 1. 88 â€‰Ma. Thermochronologic sampling was conducted in the central mountain belt between these basins. Of four muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar samples, one provides a reset age of 7. 13 â€‰±â€‰ 0. 25 â€‰Ma in the Aileu high-grade belt that suggests ~ 9 - 16 â€‰km of exhumation since that time. Eighteen zircon (U-Th) /He samples contain a group of reset ages in the Aileu Complex ranging from 4. 4 to 1. 5 â€‰Ma, which suggest exhumation rates of 1. 0 - 3. 1 â€‰mm/yr with 2. 7 - 7. 8 â€‰km of exhumation since these ages. Thirteen apatite (U-Th) /He ages in the Gondwana Sequence range from 5. 5 to 1. 4 â€‰Ma, suggesting 1 - 2 â€‰km of exhumation and defining a pattern of exhumation rates (ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 3 â€‰mm/yr) that positively correlates with average annual rainfall. Seven apatite fission track samples display varying degrees of partial <b>resetting,</b> with <b>greatest</b> <b>resetting</b> where apatite (U-Th) /He ages are youngest. Together, these data demonstrate extreme variability in surface uplift and exhumation over small spatial scales. We propose ongoing subsurface duplexing driven by subduction and underplating of Australian continental crust as the predominant driver for surface uplift and uplift-induced exhumation. Key Points Timor shows large spatial and temporal heterogeneities in uplift and exhumation Exhumation patterns suggest subsurface duplexing below island of Timor. © 2014. American Geophysical Union.

40|$|In humans, {{experimental}} studies of circadian resetting typically have been limited to lengthy episodes of exposure to continuous bright light. To evaluate {{the time course of}} the human endogenous circadian pacemaker's resetting response to brief episodes of intermittent bright light, we studied 16 subjects assigned to one of two intermittent lighting conditions in which the subjects were presented with intermittent episodes of bright-light exposure at 25 - or 90 -min intervals. The effective duration of bright-light exposure was 31 % or 63 % compared with a continuous 5 -h bright-light stimulus. Exposure to intermittent bright light elicited almost as <b>great</b> a <b>resetting</b> response compared with 5 h of continuous bright light. We conclude that exposure to intermittent bright light produces robust phase shifts of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that humans, like other species, exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to the initial minutes of bright-light exposure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{response}} of the circadian system to light varies markedly depending on photic history. Under short day lengths, hamsters exhibit larger maximal light-induced phase shifts as compared with those under longer photoperiods. However, effects of photoperiod length on sensitivity to subsaturating light remain unknown. Here, Syrian hamsters were entrained to long or short photoperiods and subsequently exposed to a 15 -min light pulse {{across a range of}} irradiances (0 - 68. 03 mW/cm 2) to phase shift activity rhythms. Phase advances exhibited a dose response, with increasing irradiances eliciting <b>greater</b> phase <b>resetting</b> in both conditions. Photic sensitivity, as measured by the half-saturation constant, was increased 40 -fold in the short photoperiod condition. In addition, irradiances that generated similar phase advances under short and long days produced equivalent phase delays, and equal photon doses produced larger delays in the short photoperiod condition. Mechanistically, equivalent light exposure induced greater pERK, PER 1, and cFOS immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of animals under shorter days...|$|R
