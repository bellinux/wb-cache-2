500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

In September 2016, {{discussing}} the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, [...] "You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, {{we will continue to}} move forward." [...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly." [...] Jed Whedon continued, [...] "Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying".|$|E

[...] The band's {{influences}} include Joe Cocker, Andrew W.K., and Schuylar Croom, lead vocalist of the band He Is Legend. They have also been compared to others such as The Format, fun. and Panic! at the Disco. [...] Of the band's lyrics and music, Liebsch has said, [...] "A {{lot of the stuff}} is a mix of what sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head", and, [...] "Most of the songs are more cautionary tales than anything else. In the end we're trying to write exciting music that's catchy and throws you for a loop at the same time." ...|$|E

He was as brave as a lion, was Jack, but he was afraid o’ that little shrivelled-up Burmese. They’ll follow me to the ship to-night.

[...] "Moss may suit my cousin Sprite, but it doesn't suit me at all. Besides, I don't like those dark places where the moss grows on the trees. I build my nest of twigs and grass and weed-stalks and I line it with hair and {{rootlets}} and feathers. Sometimes I bind it together with spider silk, and {{if you really want to}} know, I like a little hemlock-tree to put it in. It isn't very far from here, but where it is I'm not going to tell you. Have you seen my cousin, Weechi?" ...|$|E

6000|$|He paused, then continued: [...] "As it began, so it {{has gone}} on. It is always like that, is it not? The {{beginning}} is everything, the end must follow. And now it has come out, as I was fully determined {{that it should not}} do half an hour ago, when suddenly you developed eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head, and--oh! dearest, I love you. No, please be quiet; I have not done. I have told you what I am, and really there isn't much more to say about me, for I have no particular vices except the worst of them all, idleness, and not the slightest trace of any virtue that I can discover. But I have a certain knowledge of the world acquired in a long course of shooting parties, and as a man of the world I will venture to give you a bit of advice. It is possible that to you my life and death affair is a mere matter of board-ship amusement. Yet it is possible also that you might take another view of the matter. In that case, as a friend and a man of the world, I entreat you--don't. Have nothing to do with me. Send me about my business; you will never regret it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{said the}} guide, leading him up-stairs and opening a door, [...] "is a {{specimen}} of the apartments reserved for these princes of the blood." [...] There were four empty beds on iron legs, and, {{with the air}} of a showman, the Frenchman twitched away a dingy quilt. [...] "They go out in the mornings, earn enough to make them drunk, sleep it off, and then begin again. That's their life. There are people who think they ought to be reformed. 'Mon cher monsieur', one must face reality a little, even in this country. It would be a hundred times better for these people to spend their time reforming high Society. Your high Society makes all these creatures; there's no harvest without cutting stalks. 'Selon moi'," [...] he continued, putting back the quilt, and dribbling cigarette smoke through his nose, [...] "there's no grand difference between your high Society and these individuals here; both want pleasure, both think only of themselves, which is very natural. One lot have had the luck, the other--well, you see." [...] He shrugged. [...] "A common set! I've been robbed here half a dozen times. If you have new shoes, a good waistcoat, an overcoat, you want eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head. And they are populated! Change your bed, and you'll run all the dangers of not sleeping alone. 'V'la ma clientele'! The half of them don't pay me!" [...] He, snapped his yellow sticks of fingers. [...] "A penny for a shave, twopence a cut! 'Quelle vie'! Here," [...] he continued, standing by a bed, [...] "is a gentleman who owes me fivepence. Here's one who was a soldier; he's done for! All brutalised; not one with any courage left! But, believe me, monsieur," [...] he went on, opening another door, [...] "when you come down to houses of this sort you must have a vice; it's as necessary as breath is to the lungs. No matter what, you must have a vice to give you a little solace--'un peu de soulagement'. Ah, yes! before you judge these swine, reflect on life! I've been through it. Monsieur, it is not nice never to know where to get your next meal. Gentlemen who have food in their stomachs, money in their pockets, and know where to get more, they never think. Why should they--'pas de danger'! All these cages are the same. Come down, and you shall see the pantry." [...] He took Shelton through the kitchen, which seemed the only sitting-room of the establishment, to an inner room furnished with dirty cups and saucers, plates, and knives. Another fire was burning there. [...] "We always have hot water," [...] said the Frenchman, [...] "and three times a week they make a fire down there"--he pointed to a cellar--"for our clients to boil their vermin. Oh, yes, we have all the luxuries." ...|$|E
