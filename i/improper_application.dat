25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with <b>improper</b> <b>application</b> and heavy {{reliance}} throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. Jetting, dipping, and backlining are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing withholding periods by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off.

500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an <b>improper</b> <b>application</b> of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some {{results from a}} recent study on a {{variation}} of a new nonequilibrium continuum traffic flow model, where “traffic sound speed ” is constant. (We hence call this model “frozen-wave ” model.) This model resembles the Payne-Whitham model but avoids “back-traveling ” of the latter. For this “frozen-wave” model, we analyze the Riemann problem for its homogeneous system, develop two numerical solution methods to solve it, and carry out numerical simulations under both stable and unstable traffic conditions. These results show that, under stable conditions, the model behaves similarly to the Payne-Whitham model. However, under unstable traffic conditions, it has non-physical solutions or no solutions when a “vacuum problem ” occurs. This study, on one hand, provides a more complete picture of the properties of this “frozen-wave ” model and {{reduces the risk of}} <b>improper</b> <b>applications</b> of this model.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{note the}} {{imitation}} of apparently successful advertising {{as a replacement for}} thought by too many advertisers, misapplying the tactics of what seem to be past successes by other companies to current situations, sometimes not even attempting to find insight relevant to the current advertising situation. Imitation of what may be lucky accidents has become a tool for <b>improper</b> <b>applications</b> of old tactics to new problems. Design/methodology/approach – Noting the frequent pronouncements by business journalists that many businesses do things because they know they “work, ” the reality is that even among marketing professionals, conventional wisdom is often, at best, an oxymoron. Findings – The pragmatic business need is to analyze new situations and consumer interests. Originality/value – The paper shows that, since advertising decisions are often the recommendations from outside suppliers, business managers who pay for this advice must realize that past success by others does not mean that an imitative effort will enjoy similar success. Without data on how or why the other effort might have been successful means that imitation could be borrowing the worst parts of the earlier ideas...|$|R

Unfortunately, misconceptions such as lower cognitive load always being beneficial to learning and the continued use of dated concepts and methods can result in <b>improper</b> <b>applications</b> of CLT principles in medical education design and research. This review outlines how CLT has evolved and presents a synthesis of current-day CLT principles in a holistic model for medical education design. This model distinguishes three dimensions: task fidelity: from literature (lowest) through simulated patients to real patients (highest); task complexity: the number of information elements; and instructional support: from worked examples (highest) through completion tasks to autonomous task performance (lowest). These three dimensions together constitute three steps to proficient learning: (I) start with high support on low-fidelity low-complexity tasks and gradually fade that support as learners become more proficient; (II) repeat I for low-fidelity but higher-complexity tasks; and (III) repeat I and II in that order at subsequent levels of fidelity.
