40|$|AbstractAn {{association}} between {{low levels of}} <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and violent or suicidal behaviour has frequently been reported. However the role of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in {{the cycle of violence}} (Widom, 1989) has not been studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate {{association between}} exposure to violence during childhood and used adult violence in suicide attempters with low and high <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels. 81 suicide attempters were assessed with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS) measuring exposure to violence and expressed violent behaviour in childhood (between 6 and 14 years of age) and during adult life (15 years or older). We used median split to dichotomise groups below and above median <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> In patients with <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> below median, the correlation between exposure to violence as a child and used adult violence was significant (rho= 0. 52, p= 0. 002), while in patients with <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> above median, the correlation between exposure to violence as a child and expressed violent behaviour as an adult was not significant (rho= 0. 25, p= 0. 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT Information about anthropometric, dietary {{variables}} and <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> was {{collected in the}} Zutphen Study in 1960, 1965, and 1970.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether low <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration or changing <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration {{is associated with}} risk of suicide in men. DESIGN: Cohort study with annual repeat measurements of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration (for up to four years). SETTING: Paris, France. SUBJECTS: 6393 working men, aged 43 - 52 in 1967 - 72, who had at least three measurements of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individual change over time in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration (estimated using within person linear regression method); death from suicide during average of 17 years' follow up after last examination. RESULTS: 32 men committed suicide during follow up. After adjustment for age and other factors, relative risk of suicide for men with low average <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration (< 4. 78 mmol/l) compared with those with average <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration of 4. 78 - 6. 21 mmol/l was 3. 16 (95 % confidence interval 1. 38 to 7. 22, P = 0. 007). Men whose <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration decreased by more than 0. 13 mmol/l a year had multivariate adjusted relative risk of 2. 17 (0. 97 to 4. 84, P = 0. 056) compared with those whose cholesterol remained stable (change of < or = 0. 13 mmol/l a year). CONCLUSION: Both low <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration and declining cholesterol concentration were associated with increased risk of death from suicide in men. Although {{there is some evidence}} in favour of a concomitant rather than a causal effect for interpreting these associations, long term surveillance of subjects included in trials of lipid lowering treatments seems warranted...|$|R
40|$|Objective Although {{a concern}} exists that 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A reductase inhibitors (statins) might {{increase the risk}} of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the contribution of these agents to the relationship between <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and disease occurrence has been poorly investigated. Methods We compared consecutive patients having ICH with age and sex-matched stroke-free control subjects in a case-control analysis, as part of the Multicenter Study on Cerebral Haemorrhage in Italy (MUCH-Italy), and tested the presence of interaction effects between total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and statins on the risk of ICH. Results A total of 3492 cases (mean age, 73. 012. 7 years; males, 56. 6 %) and 3492 control subjects were enrolled. Increasing total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels were confirmed to be inversely associated with ICH. We observed a statistical interaction between total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and statin use for the risk of haemorrhage (Interaction OR (IOR), 1. 09; 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 12). Increasing levels of total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> were associated with a decreased risk of ICH within statin strata (average OR, 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 86 to 0. 88 for every increase of 0. 26 mmol/l of total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations), while statin use was associated with an increased risk (OR, 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 31 to 1. 81 of the average level of total <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol).</b> The protective effect of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> against ICH was reduced by statins in strictly lobar brain regions more than in non-lobar ones.

40|$|Diabetics {{often have}} {{elevated}} levels of <b>serum</b> lipids and <b>cholesterol</b> and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes {{was used to determine}} whether elevated <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels in diabetics are due to loss of control of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the committed step in cholesterol synthesis. Strain A/ST female mice were fed 10 % corn oil diets, half with 2 % cholesterol. Experimental groups were injected with 9. 0 mg streptozotocin / 100 g body weight. Diabetes was confirmed by weight loss, elevated blood sugars, and enlarged spleens. Reductase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically. <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Both diabetic and control mice fed <b>cholesterol</b> had elevated <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and decreased reductase activities. These observations suggest that HMG CoA reductase is not the primary control point in the control of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels in diabetic mice. The increase in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in the SI mice was not more than in the control group, suggesting that increased <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> is not a key factor in the control of coronary heart disease and related diseases in diabetics. The HMG CoA reductase activity was reduced in both SI and control mice fed 2 % cholesterol, but not significantly, possibly due to a small sample size.

In order to determine which factors are related to this increase, the authors investigated 99 men and 70 women whose <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> habitual food intake, and body mass index were measured between 1974 and 1979 when they were students (baseline values) and again in 1985 (follow-up measurement). <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> had increased by 0. 59 mmol/l (14 %) in men, and by 0. 34 mmol/l (7 %) in women. The effect of changes in habitual food intake on <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> was quantified as the Keys score. The mean increase of the Keys score corresponded {{to a change in}} cholesterol of 0. 12 mmol/l for both men and women.

40|$|There {{has been}} much concern and {{discussion}} whether reduction of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by diet or drugs, while preventing coronary heart disease, might cause {{an increase in the}} risk of dying from noncardiovascular disorders, in particular cancer. A review of the evidence from ecological, cross-cultural comparisons, prospective epidemiological cohort studies and intervention trials provides no indication for a cause-and-effect association between low <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> or <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> lowering and the risk of cancer, except possibly at very low levels. An inverse relationship between noncardiovascular-noncancer mortality and <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> level does exist but the link is unlikely to be causal; for better understanding, {{there is a need for}} studying the biological, lifestyle and social correlates of this association.

This study was performed to investigate whether abnormalities in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> efflux potential were related to endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: 95 type 2 diabetic patients and 19 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDVD) of the brachial artery were measured by high-resolution vascular ultrasound. <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> efflux potential was determined by measuring the transfer of [3 H] cholesterol from SR-BI rich Fu 5 AH cells to the medium induced by the test serum. Results: Type 2 diabetic patients had significantly lower HDL than controls. <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> efflux potential was reduced in diabetic patients (15. 0 ± 2. 0 vs. 18. 5 ± 2. 6 %, P< 0. 001), and both EDVD (5. 2 ± 2. 5 vs. 7. 4 ± 3. 3 %, P= 0. 001) and EIDVD (13. 4 ± 4. 5 vs. 15. 7 ± 4. 2 %, P= 0. 045) were also impaired compared with controls. <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> efflux potential correlated with both EDVD (r= 0. 23, P= 0. 02) and EIDVD (r= 0. 24, P= 0. 02) in diabetic patients.

The third purpose was to determine whether the changes in marital status described above were related to increases in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> or in cigarette smoking behavior. The rationale for the study was to determine whether previously reported associations between marital status categories and cardiovascular mortality may be mediated through higher values of risk correlates for cardiovascular disease among unmarried individuals. ^ The study group selected for this dissertation was a sample from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) population. The HDFP population was aged 30 - 69 years at the initial visit and included blacks and whites, males and females. The population was followed five years after the initial visit and periodic measurements of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> blood pressure and cigarette smoking behavior were obtained. ^ <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> was not associated with stable marital status category or with marital status prior to change. Changes in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> were associated with marital status categories after change but the <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> values deceased rather than increased. Married individuals were shown to have higher <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> values compared with unmarried. Selection of the HDFP population may have influenced an ability to detect a significant association between marital status and <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> but it is doubtful that use of a general population would alter the direction of the association. ^ Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher at the initial visit among unmarried white males and females compared with their married counterparts. No association between systolic blood pressure was found among black males or females.

40|$|Determination of <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> {{values in}} three populations of {{children}} and adolescents, totalling 4013 subjects aged 1 month to 20 years, revealed 16 cases of primary hyperbetalipoproteinemia (overall frequency, 1 : 251) {{and led to the}} detection of the disorder in 12 asymptomatic siblings. The upper limit of normal for <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> concentration was approximately 200 mg/dl at all ages studied. Dietary treatment was instituted in patients whose <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> value exceeded this limit and in whom a primary lipid defect was confirmed; the <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> value decreased in all patients who adhered to the diet. However, since the potential hazards and long-term results of dietary treatment, with or without drug therapy, in growing children are not known, such treatment should be reserved for affected children with a family history of premature atherosclerosis, and follow-up is essential...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between status incongruence and <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> was examined in a case-control study {{carried out in}} an English general practice population. Patients (n = 54) with elevated <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterols</b> ([greater-or-equal, slanted] 7. 0 mmol/l) were compared to age and sex matched controls (n = 54). A specific type of status incongruence [...] lifestyle incongruity [...] was measured as {{the degree to which}} style of life (material consumption and status-enhancing behaviors) exceeded occupational status. Lifestyle incongruity was associated with higher <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and an increased odds of being a case. This association was independent of age, sex, the body mass index, family history of cardiovascular disease, alcohol use, and, for women, menopausal status. Implications of these results for research on social inequality and the risk of cardiovascular disease are discussed. status incongruence <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> general practice...|$|R
40|$|AREPORT by Avigan et al. (1960) {{shows that}} {{triparanol}} 2 lowered <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> of male rats. The reduction in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> varied {{according to the}} concentration of triparanol fed {{and the length of}} time it was fed. Growth was re-duced as dosage was increased. Steinberg and Avigan (1960) postulated that tripar-anol blocks cholesterol synthesis at the desmosterol to cholesterol step. With in vitro liver homogenates, triparanol treat-ment inhibited the conversion of des-mosterol to cholesterol. Because of the work of Steinberg and Avigan, it was thought that triparanol might also lower <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in the chick and possibly even lower egg yolk cholesterol values...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{neomycin}} {{were studied}} on <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and fecal steroids in hypercholesterolemic patients during a short treatment period (4 wk) {{and a long}} treatment period (16 mo), using small (1. 5 g/d) and large (up to 6 g/d) doses alone and in combination with cholestyramine. In the short-term low-dose study the decrease in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by 21 % {{was associated with a}} proportionate increase in fecal cholesterol elimination as neutral sterols through impaired <b>cholesterol</b> absorption. <b>Serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> remained low and fecal steroid excretion remained elevated in the long-term neomycin study. Increasing the dosage from 1. 5 to 6 g/d {{at the end of the}} 16 -mo period brought about a further slight decrease in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and a small further increase in fecal neutral and acidic steroids. The increases in fecal bile acids and fat but not in neutral sterols were positively correlated with the increases in the neomycin dosage. Thus, large neomycin doses can also cause bile acid malabsorption. In another series of patients, a decrease (25 %) in <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by cholestyramine was associated with a proportional increase in the fecal elimination of cholesterol (2. 5 -fold) as bile acids. The inclusion of neomycin in cholestyramine therapy further increased fecal steroid output (solely as neutral sterols) by only about one-fifth of that due to cholestyramine, but further decreased <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> almost to the same extent (- 17 %) as cholestyramine alone. The overall decrease was 38 %, no side effects occurred, and the patients found combination therapy convenient. Neomycin decreased <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in different studies by 10 ± 2, 17 ± 4, and 12 ± 4 % per 100 mg/d of the increment in fecal steroids, the respective decrease for cholestyramine being only 2. 2 ± 0. 5 %. Thus, neomycin effectively reduced <b>serum</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by a relatively small increase in cholesterol elimination (via cholesterol malabsorption) compared with cholestyramine-induced bile acid malabsorption...|$|R
