40|$|<b>Ingredient</b> <b>and</b> {{nutritional}} {{information are}} currently mandatory {{in many countries}} for food labeling. Although wine is generally exempt from this requirement, regulatory changes are being actively considered by authorities across the globe. In this paper, {{a review of the}} current international requirements for the presentation of <b>ingredient</b> <b>and</b> nutritional information is undertaken. A literature review of studies into consumer's requirements and understanding of such information is undertaken and the potential costs to producers analysed. The study makes a number of conclusions on whether <b>ingredient</b> <b>and</b> nutritional labeling is appropriate for wine and investigates the effectiveness, usefulness and impact of such a labeling regime...|$|R

5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E

5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through {{the importation of}} <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> ideas from North America, China, and India {{during the time of}} the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.|$|E
5|$|Filipino cuisine {{has evolved}} over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic, Chinese, American, and other Asian {{influences}} that have been adapted to local <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes.

5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct <b>ingredients,</b> <b>and</b> it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E

5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> {{influence}} from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E

5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today. Although the English had an inherent disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native <b>ingredients</b> <b>and</b> dishes.|$|E
