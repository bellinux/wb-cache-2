He told Einstein that he had discovered a [...] "specific biologically <b>effective</b> <b>energy</b> which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy." [...] He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon [...] "in the fight against the Fascist pestilence". (Einstein had signed a letter to President Roosevelt in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich was suggesting, it would be [...] "a bomb." ...|$|E

40|$|We derive the <b>effective</b> low <b>energy</b> Hamiltonian for the tight-binding {{model with}} the hopping {{integral}} slowly varying along the chain. The effective Hamiltonian contains the kinetic energy with position dependent mass, which is inverse to the hopping integral, and <b>effective</b> potential <b>energy.</b> Changing of ordering in the kinetic energy leads to {{change of the}} <b>effective</b> potential <b>energy</b> and leaves the Hamiltonian the same one. Therefore, we can choose arbitrary von Roos ordering parameters in the kinetic energy without changing the Hamiltonian. Moreover, we propose a more general form for the kinetic energy than that of von Roos, which nevertheless together with the <b>effective</b> potential <b>energy</b> represent the same Hamiltonian...|$|R
40|$|The {{derivation}} of integral fluxes from instrument coincidence rates requires accurate {{knowledge of}} their <b>effective</b> <b>energies.</b> Recent cross calibrations of GOES with the high-energy-resolution Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8 Goddard Medium Energy Experiment (GME) (Sandberg et al., Geophys. Res. Lett, 41, 4435, 2014 a) gave significantly lower <b>effective</b> <b>energies</b> than those currently used by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center to calculate solar proton integral fluxes from GOES rates. This implies systematically lower integral fluxes than currently produced. This paper quantifies {{the differences between the}} current and the cross-calibrated GOES integral fluxes and validates the latter. Care is taken to rule out the spectral resolution of the measurements or different integration algorithms as major contributors to differences in the magnitudes of the derived integral fluxes. The lower <b>effective</b> <b>energies</b> are validated by comparison with the independent, high-resolution observations by the STEREO Low-Energy Telescope (LET) and High-Energy Telescope (HET) during the December 2006 solar proton events. The current GOES product is similar to the > 10 [*]MeV integral fluxes recalculated by using the Sandberg et al. [2014 a] <b>effective</b> <b>energies</b> but is substantially greater at higher energies. (The median ratios of the current to the recalculated fluxes are 1. 1 at > 10 [*]MeV, 1. 7 at > 30 [*]MeV, 2. 1 at > 60 [*]MeV, and 2. 9 at > 100 [*]MeV.) By virtue of this validation, the cross-calibrated GOES integral fluxes should be considered more accurate than the current NOAA product. The results of this study also demonstrate good consistency between the two long-term IMP 8 GME and STEREO LET and HET solar proton data sets...|$|R
2500|$|Tylor cited a [...] "minimum definition" [...] of {{religion}} as [...] "the belief in Spiritual Beings". Noting that no savage societies lack religion {{and that the}} initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution {{of religion}}: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of Primitive Culture, Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits. He used the word [...] "animism" [...] in two different senses. The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an <b>effective</b> <b>energy,</b> shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which comparative religion attempts to reconstruct.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The X-ray dose {{absorbed in}} soft tissue located near plane bone {{interfaces}} and in parallel-slab bone cavities was measured experimentally with a polyethylene-film dosimeter. The dose absorbed in soft tissue adjacent to plane bone interfaces {{was measured by}} placing a 12. 7 micron film of polyethylene, upon which were deposited graphite electrodes, in contact with bone-equivalent disks of Shonka plastic. The dose was measured both {{as a function of}} X-ray quality and distance of the tissue-equivalent polyethylene away from the bone interface. The dose in finite soft tissue layers next to bone was also measured as a function of X-ray quality. The results indicated that the soft tissue dose in finite layers next to the bone was greater than that remote from the bone. At the lower <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies</b> the dose very close to the bone was considerably higher than for the higher <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies.</b> At higher <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies,</b> however, the increased dose effect extended to a greater depth in the soft tissue. At <b>effective</b> <b>energies</b> greater than 177 keV electronic equilibrium was obtained, and the dose was the same for the adjacent and distant soft tissue. Comparisons were made of the experimentally measured doses in soft tissue near plane bone interfaces with calculated doses for monoenergetic photons. It was observed that at <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies</b> below approximately 60 keV the experimental results gave higher dose values than the theoretical values. However, at higher <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies</b> there was good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results. It was concluded that X-ray spectral considerations were mainly responsible for the deviations at lower <b>effective</b> <b>energies.</b> The results of this study indicated that when one wishes to calculate the dose absorbed in soft tissue adjacent to plane bone interfaces at low <b>effective</b> X-ray <b>energies,</b> the theory cannot be relied upon and experimentally determined doses such as those shown herein should be used instead. The X-ray dose in soft tissue elements interposed between parallel slabs of bone was measured {{in the same manner as}} the dose in soft tissue adjacent to plane bone interfaces. However, due to experimental difficulties in simulating this bone-tissue orientation, it was not possible to make reasonable dose measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{release and}} {{migration}} of soil chemicals from agricultural lands {{is both an}} economic loss and {{a threat to the}} quality of surface water and groundwater. Kinetic energy from rainfall {{is one of the most}} active factors affecting soil solute transport in runoff. To determine the influence of <b>effective</b> raindrop kinetic <b>energy</b> on soil potassium transfer into runoff, a series of laboratory experiments with different raindrop falling heights and rain intensities was performed. The experimental results indicate that <b>effective</b> raindrop kinetic <b>energy</b> affects soil surface properties and infiltration processes, including infiltration volume and wetting front advance.
