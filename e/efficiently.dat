5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that <b>efficiently</b> interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo <b>efficiently.</b> To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more <b>efficiently</b> through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|Calculating a {{greatest}} common divisor is {{an essential}} step in several integer factorization algorithms, such as Pollard's rho algorithm, Shor's algorithm, Dixon's factorization method and the Lenstra elliptic curve factorization. The Euclidean algorithm {{may be used to}} find this GCD <b>efficiently.</b> Continued fraction factorization uses continued fractions, which are determined using Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
5|$|Colt's {{manufacturing}} methods {{were at the}} forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the first to use the assembly line <b>efficiently.</b> Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.|$|E
5|$|During {{his career}} in Wisconsin, Kindt was {{considered}} to be the team's best all-around player, a person who could run, throw, and kick <b>efficiently,</b> as well as playing defense. He also punted and played safety for Wisconsin. Kindt was named to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E
5|$|For artillery, wooden cannons, {{only able}} to fire 3 or 4 shots before bursting, coexisted with {{state-of-the-art}} Armstrong guns using explosive shells. Armstrong guns were <b>efficiently</b> used by the troops of Satsuma and Saga throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an infectious agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio <b>efficiently</b> blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, <b>efficiently</b> protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that <b>efficiently</b> reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do <b>efficiently.</b> A major factor in the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E
5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to <b>efficiently</b> use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Packaging: SiC chips {{may have}} a higher power density than silicon power devices {{and are able to}} handle higher {{temperatures}} exceeding the silicon limit of 150°C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to <b>efficiently</b> get the heat out of the devices and ensure a reliable interconnection.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of Magic Lantern {{argue the}} {{technology}} would allow {{law enforcement to}} <b>efficiently</b> and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Unlike a predecessor, Carnivore, implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, which would necessitate a court order.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} <b>efficiently</b> and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after {{dispersal}} of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very <b>efficiently</b> in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate <b>efficiently</b> within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Texas modernized and {{expanded}} its system {{of higher education}} through the 1960s. The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education, funded {{in large part by}} oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more <b>efficiently.</b> These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Dwarfs made rare {{appearances}} in shorts, despite their popularity; they simply were {{too numerous to}} animate <b>efficiently.</b> Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade (1939), The Seven Wise Dwarfs (1941, using mostly recycled footage), All Together (1942) and The Winged Scourge (1943) all include appearances.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very <b>efficiently</b> in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate <b>efficiently</b> within nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary {{searches for the}} same value in multiple arrays, <b>efficiently</b> solving a series of search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more <b>efficiently</b> than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least <b>efficiently</b> on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} about the capability of ASC to handle {{the maintenance of the}} submarines. Defence officials believe that the full cycle docking (which was intended to take a year per submarine, but as of 2009 was averaging three years) could be handled more <b>efficiently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} vaccine are used {{throughout}} the world to combat polio. Both types induce immunity to polio, <b>efficiently</b> blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community (so-called herd immunity).|$|E
5|$|UN forces, {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} {{troops from the}} Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States (US), and United Kingdom (UK), enjoyed overwhelming air and sea superiority during the battle. The UN <b>efficiently</b> procured and transported supplies from a large stockpile of materiel in nearby Japan.|$|E
