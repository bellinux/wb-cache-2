50|$|The PL-4A is a sport {{airplane}} {{intended to}} answer {{the need for a}} well designed, all-metal airplane which is easy to build, easy to fly, with low initial and operating costs, and folding wings so that it may be towed behind an automobile and stored at home. It is a low-wing airplane, VW-powered, with a closed or open cockpit large enough to accommodate even very large persons, and a generous baggage compartment. A “T” tail configuration improves rudder effectiveness and prevents the stabilator from interfering with the folded wings.Wing: In order to favor takeoff and climb performance, a high aspect ratio of 8 is used, which in combination with a large diameter, slow turning prop should provide good performance even at high altitude airports. The airfoil is the NACA 633418, which has a mild stall and a good overall performance even at “standard roughness.” The 18% thickness provides a deep spar, high torsional rigidity, and makes possible the simple, compact fittings at the wing <b>folding</b> <b>joint,</b> which are band-sawed from aluminum plate. The chord is constant at 40 in., and there is no washout.The ailerons have differential travel to minimize, adverse yaw. They are hinged at the bottom skin with standard piano hinges, as in the PL-1 and 2, providing smooth airflow {{over the top of the}} “down” aileron, and a good gap seal. The mass balance is concentrated in a lead weight attached to an arm extending into the wing box.|$|E

50|$|Everyday manual wheelchairs come in {{two major}} varieties, folding or rigid. Folding chairs are {{generally}} low-end designs, whose predominant advantage {{is being able to}} fold, generally by bringing the two sides together. However this is largely an advantage for part-time users who may need to store the wheelchair more often than use it. Rigid wheelchairs, which are increasingly preferred by full-time and active users, have permanently welded joints and many fewer moving parts. This reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex and absorb energy as it moves. Welded rather than <b>folding</b> <b>joints</b> also reduce the overall weight of the chair. Rigid chairs typically feature instant-release rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat, allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car. A few wheelchairs attempt to combine the features of both designs by providing a fold-to-rigid mechanism in which the joints are mechanically locked when the wheelchair is in use.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} polymorphism in {{the structure}} of the tail among first-stage larvae of Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei (Protostrongylidae). Two distinct larvae, both with a characteristic dorsal spine, include (1) a morphotype with a kinked conical tail marked by three distinct transverse <b>folds</b> or <b>joints</b> and a symmetrical terminal tail spike and (2) a morphotype with a digitate terminal region lacking <b>folds</b> or <b>joints</b> and with an asymmetrical, subterminal tail spike. These divergent larval forms had been postulated as perhaps representing distinct species of elaphostrongyline nematodes. Application of a multilocus approach using ITS- 2 sequences from the nuclear genome and COX-II sequences from the mitochondrial genome confirmed the identity of these larvae as P. odocoilei. Additionally, based on scanning electron microscopy (low-temperature field emission), the cephalic region of these larvae consisted of a cuticular triradiate stoma surrounded by six single circumoral papillae of the inner circle, ten papillae of the outer circle (four paired and two single), and two lateral amphids. Ours is the first demonstration of structural polymorphism among larval conspecifics in the Metastrongyloidea and Strongylida. The basis for this polymorphism remains undetermined, but such phenomena, if discovered to be more widespread, may contribute to continued confusion in discriminating among first-stage larvae for species, genera, and subfamilies within Protostrongylidae...|$|R

In this work, the effect of these factors on seam strength was studied using both Taguchi's design of experiment (TDOE) as well as an artificial neural network (ANN).

The contribution of each factor to seam strength was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal to noise ratio methods. From the analysis {{it was found that the}} fabric width, <b>folding</b> length of <b>joint</b> and interaction between the <b>folding</b> length of <b>joint</b> and the seam design affected seam strength significantly. Further, using TDOE, an optimal configuration of levels of factors was found. In order to contrast and compare the results from TDOE, an ANN was also used to predict seam strength using the above mentioned factors as inputs. The prediction from TDOE and ANN methodologies were compared with physical seam strength.

40|$|Purpose: Behçet’s {{disease is}} a multisystem disease char-acterized by {{recurrent}} oral and genital ulcers, relaps-ing uveitis, mucocutaneous, articular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and vascular manifestations. Paraoxonase is believed {{to play an important}} role in protection of LDL and HDL particles from oxidation, in antioxidant effect against lipid peroxidation on cellular membranes, and in anti-inflammatory process. Lipid peroxidation and free oxygen radicals have been thought to play a role in pathogenesis of BD. The association of paraoxonase gene polymorphisms with Behçet’s Disease in a group of Turkish patients with clinical manifestations and healthy controls has been investigated. Patients and Methods: Paraoxonase (PON- 1 -L 55 M) gene polymorphism was investigated in 50 Behcet patients and 50 healthy in-dividuals with a PCR/RFLP method. Results: There were significant differences between patients and the control group in allele frequencies of the PON 1 L 55 M polymor-phism (p= 0. 04). Also, when patients were compared with the control group according to clinical manifestations, this statistical significance was getting sharper.

40|$|Numerous {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} are hosted within the Meso to Neo-Archean banded iron formations (BIFs) extending across the Singhbhum-Orissa Craton, eastern India. Despite the widespread distribution of BIFs, which forms {{part of the}} iron ore group (IOG), heterogeneity in their grade and mineral composition is occasionally observed even within a single ore deposit. Kiriburu-Meghahatuburu iron ore deposit (KMIOD), west Singhbhum district, Jharkhand, eastern India {{is characterized by a}} dominant hematite (often martitized) occurrence with a total resource of > 150 million tonnes (MT) at 62. 85 wt % Fe. Very high-grade blue dust ore (friable and powdery hematitewith~ 67 % Fe), high-grade massive, hard laminated hematitic ores (~ 66 % Fe) and medium to low grade goethitic/lateritic ores (50 %– 60 % Fe) are the common iron-ore lithologies in KMIOD. These ores can be distinguished in the field from their physical appearance, meso-scale texture and spatial occurrences with the host rocks along with the variation in chemical composition. The high-grade ores are characterized by high Fe (> 62 wt %), low Al 2 O 3 (1. 5 – 2. 5 wt %), low SiO 2 (2. 0 – 4. 5 wt %) and low P (< 0. 06 wt %). Detailed field studies and laboratory investigations on the ore mineral assemblages suggest that the mineralization of high-grade iron ores at KMIOD is controlled by three major parameters, i. e., lithological, paleoclimatic and structural controls. High-grade iron ores such as blue dust seem to be formed during leaching processes through inter-bedded ferruginous shale and banded hematite jasper (BHJ) occurring within BIFs. Structural elements such as <b>folds,</b> <b>joint</b> network, fracture arrays, local faults and steeply dipping bedding planes are surmised as strong controls for the evolution of different iron ore types from the BHJ. Most of the high-grade ores are concentrated at the hinge portions of second generation folds (F 2) owing to the easy access for circulation of meteoric solution along the fractures developed due to release of stresses at the hinge portions aided by supergene ore enrichment processes. The BHJ and interbedded ferruginous shale seem to have been given a significant contribution for the formation of different grades of iron ores over the area. Lithologically, the BIFs are governed by rheological features providing channel ways in the ore enrichment process. The variation in the iron ore mineralogy is caused by the variation in depositional and paleoclimatic environment, structural setting and lithological attributes. Hence, these parameters could be used for future exploration and grade recovery of iron ore resources in the region and in the adjoining areas...|$|R

Substance P immunofiuorescent nerves are demonstrated in the inferior joint recess capsule and its synovial folds in human lumbosacral zygapophyseal joints. This may have clinical significance in spinal pain. KEY WORDS: LOW back pain, lumbar spine, synovial folds, nociceptors, immunohistochemistry, substance P. ZYGAPOPHYSEAL joint capsules consist of (i) an outer layer of strong dense fibro-elastic con-nective tissue which is continuous with the periosteum of bone, (ii) a middle vascular fatty layer of subsynovial loose connective tissue, and (iii) a synovial membrane forming the innermost layer [1]. The joint capsule contains nonmyelinated and myelinated nerves [2 - 4]. The synovial folds con-tain small diameter (0. 2 urn) paravascular myeli-nated nerves [5], and small diameter (0. 6 - 12 |im) myelinated nerves which are remote from blood vessels [3]. The presence of intra-articular synovial <b>folds</b> in zygapophyseal <b>joints</b> has been well docu-mented [2, 6 - 24].
