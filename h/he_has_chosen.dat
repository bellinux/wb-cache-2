5|$|At Jason's behest, the demigods {{travel to}} Split {{to visit the}} tomb of Diocletian, {{retrieve}} his powerful scepter, and leave a note for Reyna (who has been asked by Annabeth to find the Greek demigods). The god Cupid, guardian of the scepter, refuses to relinquish it until Nico admits that he once {{had a crush on}} Percy Jackson. Sailing through the Adriatic Sea, the ship is attacked by Khione and the Boreads and is only narrowly defended by Piper's newly powerful charmspeaking skills; Piper is still disappointed in her performance and resolves to train in swordsmanship. During the attack, Leo is transported to Ogygia, where he falls in love with Calypso. Although he leaves the island, Leo promises to return for her. While Leo is detained, {{the rest of the crew}} meets with Notus, who helps Jason to realize that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>chosen</b> to be a Greek rather than a Roman demigod, thus settling an internal conflict within himself.

5|$|They fly to Spain {{separately}} and meet in Barcelona. They decide their schedule, where {{they plan to}} visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>chosen</b> deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. Imran spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E
