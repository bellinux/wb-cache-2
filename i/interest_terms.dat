Yield curve is a plot of interest rate yields on bill or bond with differing terms to maturity but with the same risk. The relationship between short and long interest rates and shape of yield curve are both explained by the following theories: expectations hypothesis and market segmentation hypothesis. The expectation hypothesis is not a homogenous theory and has several types. The expectations hypothesis can be divided into the pure expectations theory and weight expectations theory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our research}} on the feasibility of extracting Twitter users' interests for suggesting serendipitous connections using natural language processing (NLP) technology. Defined by Andel [1] as the art of making an unsought finding, serendipity has a positive role in scientific research and people's daily lives. Applications that facilitate serendipity would bring various benefits to us. In this work, {{we focus on the}} mining of users' interests from Twitter messages (tweets hereafter) to support the detection of serendipitous connections. To address the challenge, we explore a set of NLP tools to develop a real-time system for automatically extracting the users' interests in the form of named entities and core terms. We also examine the different contributions of three different information sources with regard to the user's interests. Furthermore, we examine the issue of determining the additional attribute of surprisingness/ unexpectedness of the terms and entities of interest which we deem critical for detecting serendipitous connections. Our prototype system was tested with a group of Twitter users involving approximately 2, 300 tweets. Our algorithm achieved varying degrees of success on each of the users, demonstrating feasibility of identifying serendipitous <b>interest</b> <b>terms</b> and entities. For example, 27. 5 % of terms extracted for one of the users were judged to be serendipitous...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify, based on the {{portfolio}} balance exchange rate determination theory, the impact of the foreign exchange swaps offered by the Central Bank of Brazil on the attributes of the local foreign exchange <b>interest</b> rate <b>term</b> structure. For this, it is used the Principal Component Regression. As a complementary analysis the volatility of the local foreign exchange <b>interest</b> rate <b>term</b> structure and the volatility of the foreign exchange spot were studied. The results concerning the foreign exchange swaps were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local foreign exchange <b>interest</b> rate <b>term</b> structure. On the other hand, the swaps known as reversal foreign exchange swaps showed results that point out that the offer of this product by the Central Bank had no impact on the level of the local foreign exchange interest rate market.

40|$|This article explores {{a series}} of paradoxes exposed by {{specialization}} within the legal profession. It will argue that while the existing literature rightly identifies specialization as posing potential challenges to coherence, legitimacy, and professional ethics, it fails {{to grapple with the}} relationship between professional competence and specialization. In exploring this relationship, three paradoxes are articulated. The first is that specialization is both a necessary element in the development of professionalism and a threat to it. The second is the normative ambiguity of specialization: specialization is capable of giving rise to both benefits and detriments. The third paradox is the profession's response to this ambiguity. It will be argued that the profession's approach is incoherent in public <b>interest</b> <b>terms</b> and can be best explained as part of a desire to protect its members' interests and its collective identity over the public interest in competence. These arguments are made in the context of {{a series of}} three empirical studies of specialists and nonspecialists in legal aid practice in England and Wales. The evidence is worrying enough to suggest significant concerns about the quality and indeed legitimacy of the professional qualification as a general warrant of competence. The implications for institutionalizing specialization within the legal profession are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Gene Ontology (GO) {{is used to}} {{describe}} genes and gene products from many organisms. When used for functional annotation of microarray data, GO is often slimmed by editing so that only higher level terms remain. This practice is designed to improve the summarizing of experimental results by grouping high level terms and the statistical power of GO term enrichment analysis. Here, we propose {{a new approach to}} editing the gene ontology, clipping, which is the editing of GO according to biological relevance. Creation of a GO subset by clipping is achieved by removing terms (from all hierarchal levels) if they are not functionally relevant to a given domain of <b>interest.</b> <b>Terms</b> that are located in levels higher to relevant terms are kept, thus, biologically irrelevant terms are only removed if they are not parental to terms that are relevant. Results: Using this approach, we have created the Neural-Immune Gene Ontology (NIGO) subset of GO directed for neurological and immunological systems. We tested the performance of NIGO in extracting knowledge from microarray experiments by conducting functional analysis and comparing the results to those obtained using the full GO and a generic GO slim.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of improving companies ́ ratings used {{for the evaluation of}} the probability of default of the credits granted by banks. There are two general views mentioned in the article. The view of banks, which can refine their conditions, and, above all, adapt themselves to potential risks, which leads to an improvement of their own risk management and their refinancing conditions. The view of companies, whose good ratings, no matter whether arranged by banks or by external rating agencies, imply appropriate <b>interest</b> <b>terms.</b> The influencing factors for the rating are known by many companies. Hence, in practice it is often a target to influence these factors and key figures positively. A successful implementation of the findings of the conducted survey would help companies to improve their rating. The main part of the article describes the results extracted for this purpose from the survey which was carried out between 28 November. 2008 and 28 February 2009. The analysis of the survey identified contemporary allocation of documents, completeness of documents, actual financial + profit planning, disclosure of accounting policy and extensive company documentation as the five best possibilities for companies to improve their ratings. Also we can see a strong weighting of the banks on measures within the ranges of do- cumentation and balance relations. Of course, the conclusion concerning the best possibility for the rating improvement cannot be seen as unambiguous, since it depends on too many variables...|$|E

40|$|Exchange rate-based {{inflation}} stabilization (ERBS) {{policies are}} associated with a boom-recession cycle in economic activity and sustained real exchange rate appreciation. A class of models in the literature has explained these empirical regularities with the lack of credibility of the stabilization plans. The lack-of-credibility models typically assume perfectly forward-looking pricing behavior without inflation stickiness and attribute the slow decline in inflation to the consumption boom that occurs due to the perceived temporariness of the ERBS policy. This paper tests the empirical validity of forward-looking pricing behavior in Mexico and Turkey, two countries which have experienced ERBS. It finds that the forward- and backward-looking components of inflation weigh approximately equally in pricing behavior, and therefore, that inflation is partially sticky. The paper then develops the theoretical implications of partial inflation stickiness in a lack of credibility model of ERBS and concludes that the presence of stickiness significantly reduces the persistence of the consumption boom predicted by the model, but helps to explain the recession in the late phase of the stabilization.

40|$|BANKADVISER is a multicriteria {{industrial}} evaluation system. It provides {{evaluations of}} individual {{items such as}} firms, industries, companies, industrial clients, within a set of similar ones. The evaluations take into account not only the own scores of the item but also {{those of the other}} ones in the set (positioning). The evaluation procedure is based on financial data from the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement of each item. BANKADVISER is particularly useful for decision-makers, financial analysts, banks, insurance companies, when they have to make decisions about their industrial clients. The system allows one to manage the data about the clients, to analyse their economic profile, to detect their strong and weak features, to evaluate any risk associated with them. Decisions such as whether or not to provide a loan, fix the loan modalities (<b>interest,</b> <b>terms,),</b> offer guarantee for foreign activities, cover some deficits, can easily be finalized after the BANKADVISER evaluation. BANKADVISER is a visual interactive modelling system. It is interactive because for each item, the user has the opportunity to run through one part of the information to another, because he can ask for additional information on the strong or the weak features of the profile, because comparison with similar items can be given on request. It is a modelling system because an intricate multicriteria situation is modelled by using the extended PROMETHEE MCDM methodology. BANKADVISER has been implemented on a microcomputer. For the sake of an effective presentation the paper has been written according to the structure of the microcomputer software. It is illustrated by data of a Real-World application. © 1991.

Nevertheless, such variations in interest rates cannot be attributed solely to monetary policy decisions. This occurs since interest rates respond to various factors and events. Thus, it is important to decompose the effect of a change in monetary policy in two, a “reaction” (feedback) and an “active” (exogenous) component. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to analyze whether the increase in interest rates following a monetary restriction is due exclusively to changes in monetary policy (“active” monetary policy) or to events previously discounted by markets (“reaction” monetary policy). Using a vector autoregression technique, evidence is presented to support the fact that Mexican monetary policy has had an “active” component in the last years. monetary policy, <b>interest</b> rate <b>term</b> structure, “short”, vector autoregression, impulse-response function...|$|R
