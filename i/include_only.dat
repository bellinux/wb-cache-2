5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains <b>include</b> <b>only</b> one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E

However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should <b>include</b> <b>only</b> those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E

5|$|Aves and {{a sister}} group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most {{commonly}} defined phylogenetically as all descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|In the 1910s, 2100 South in Salt Lake County {{became an}} {{unnumbered}} state highway. In 1919, {{when the state}} legislature redefined the state road system to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> a short list given in the law and any federal aid projects, 2100 South east of State Street remained as {{a portion of the}} Lincoln Highway. In 1926, 2100 South became part of US-40, following the creation of the United States Numbered Highway system. By 1937, 2100 South west of 9180 West was assigned to US-50, US-40 now turning northward toward Downtown Salt Lake City. This created two signed highways over 2100 South: US-40 east of US-91 and US-50 east of 9200 West (US-50 traveled west on 3500 South through Salt Lake City from US-91 to 2100 South in Magna, whereas US-40 turned from eastbound 2100 South to northbound State Street to connect to North Temple).|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{spent the}} rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise {{financing}} for the American Graffiti script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end American Graffiti showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.|$|E
5|$|Regulations for the {{performance}} of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may <b>include</b> <b>only</b> music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo.|$|E
5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, {{reviews for}} the album were mixed, with {{criticism}} directed towards both the new {{material and the}} decision to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> Carey's number one hits in the United States. While receiving tepid reviews from music critics, the album became a large commercial success throughout the world. It debuted at number four on Billboard 200, number one in Japan, and in the top-ten throughout almost every major music market around the globe. #1's was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of five million copies throughout the United States. Aside from the US, the album experienced its strongest sales in Japan, where the album sold 3,250,000 copies {{in the first three}} months after its release. The album was certified the triple-million award, and currently remains the best-selling album of all-time in Japan by a non-Asian artist. In Europe, #1's was certified double-platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting shipments of two million copies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its initial}} release, Wolfenstein 3D has been ported to {{numerous}} other platforms. These include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994), Mac OS (1994), Atari Jaguar (1994), Acorn Archimedes (1994), 3DO (1995), Apple IIGS (1998), and PC-98 (1998). The Super NES and Jaguar ports {{were developed by}} id, while the rest were produced by other companies. Later releases include the Game Boy Advance (2002), Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and an iOS version programmed by Carmack himself (2009). These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the originalâ€”the Super NES version notably replaced the blood with sweat, dogs with rats, and removed all Nazi references, although the core gameplay and aesthetic are retained. Many of the ports <b>include</b> <b>only</b> the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes Spear of Destiny, and a 2007 Steam release for PC, OS X, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes. Bethesda Softworks, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3Ds release by producing a free-to-play browser-based version {{of the game in}} 2012.|$|E
5|$|The second boom in Death Valley was tourism, {{started in}} the 1920s by Herman Eichbaum. After several {{failures}} in getting a toll road approved from Lida, Nevada or over Towne Pass, he scaled back plans to <b>include</b> <b>only</b> {{the part of the}} latter route between southeast of Darwin and his resort at Stovepipe Wells. The new Eichbaum Toll Road was certified complete on May 4, 1926, and toll rates were set: $2 per motor vehicle and 50Â¢ per person. In 1933, the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system, including a new (unsigned) Route 127, connecting Tipton with Baker via Lone Pine and Death Valley Junction. The Death Valley National Monument was created on February 11, 1933, and in December 1934 the Division of Highways paid $25,000 for the 30.35-mile (48.84km) road, giving the 17 miles (27km) east of the park boundary at the pass to the National Park Service. The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon paved the route from Lone Pine (on US 395) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to Baker (on US 91). The work was completed in October 1937, including the 17.5-mile (18km) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of Panamint Springs. The National Park Service, using Civilian Conservation Corps labor, maintained the road through the park until August 1942, when an 11-mile (18km) stretch east of the valley was washed out by a storm. At that time, maintenance was given back to the state, which rebuilt the destroyed segment.|$|E
