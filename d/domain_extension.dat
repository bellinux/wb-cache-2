2500|$|A special {{extension}} to the C-terminal kinase domain core, the so-called [...] "Domain for Versatile Docking" [...] (DVD) is a region found in MKK7 {{as in most}} known MAP2Ks,. The DVD region is a stable, mostly helical fold of roughly 20 amino acids, that adds onto {{the back side of}} the catalytic core of the MAP2K kinase domains. This <b>domain</b> <b>extension</b> is both required for the specific binding to, and activation of MKK7 by respective upstream MAPKKKs. Other mitogen activated protein kinase kinases also require the DVD region (in addition to various other non-canonical elements of their kinase domains, like the [...] "MKK1/2-loop") to be able to discriminate against the various MAPKKK upstream. These special MAPKK:MAPKKK kinase-domain/kinase-domain interactions facilitate the phosphorylation of MKK7. [...] In addition to the activation of MKK7, binding to the DVD region may also affect the MKK7 activation loop in such a way that the Ser and Thr of the S-K-A-K-T motif become accessible for phosphorylation.|$|E
