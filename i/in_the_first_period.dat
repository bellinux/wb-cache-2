5|$|Entering the 2002 playoffs as {{the eighth}} seed {{for the second}} {{consecutive}} year, the Canucks faced the Presidents' Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings in the opening round. With 32- and 34-save performances from Cloutier, Vancouver won the first two games of the series. In game three, the Canucks and Red Wings were tied with a minute remaining in the second period when Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström scored on Cloutier with a slapshot from centre ice. The goal was observed by the media as {{a turning point in the}} series for both Cloutier and the Canucks as a team.

Ruslan Fedotenko, with an assist from Evgeni Malkin, tied the game before the conclusion of the first period. Detroit went on to score a goal in each of the final two periods to win Game 1, 3–1.

Facing elimination in Game 5, Henrik scored a power play goal late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> to give Vancouver the early lead, though Canucks were unable to add another goal and eventually lost 2–1 in overtime.

5|$|The {{salary for}} Soviet {{citizens}} increased abruptly by almost 2.5 {{times during the}} plan. Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eight-Five Year Plan. The first period, 1960–1964, was characterised by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated {{the success of the}} Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>period</b> and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981–1985). Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.|$|E
