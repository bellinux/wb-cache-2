30|$|As {{a result}} of the {{interactions}} of wildfires with each other, landscapes with assorted patterns of juxtaposed and <b>interspersed</b> <b>vegetation</b> species, age classes, and structures exist in each of the wilderness areas. These components must lead to variability in fire behavior and fire effects in the future as the landscape ages. Because the interactions of landscape patterns and process are continuous through time, the net effect is a dynamic, perhaps self-regulating landscape, whose components are created and influenced by fire, and have an effect on future fires (Falk et al. 2007, McKenzie et al. 2011). Thus, part of the role of large wildfires in these wilderness areas—including the episodes of multiple large wildfires and the interludes with few large wildfires—is to create and maintain an assortment of patches and edges across the landscape that preserve ecological diversity and function.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{selection}} by {{directional growth}} of plants {{has previously been}} investigated but field evidence for this phenomenon is extremely scarce. In this study we demonstrate directional clonal growth in Aechmea nudicaulis, a monocarpic, perennial bromeliad native to spatially heterogeneous sandy coastal plains (restinga) in Brazil. This habitat {{is characterized by a}} matrix of bare sand with <b>interspersed</b> <b>vegetation</b> islands. Due to very high soil surface temperatures and other stress factors such as drought, A. nudicauliscan only germinate inside vegetation islands. Nevertheless, this species is very common on bare sand. In this study we tested the hypothesis that clonal fragments occurring at the border and inside vegetation islands show habitat selection by growing preferentially towards the bare sand habitat (i. e. away from the center of vegetation islands). We randomly chose 116 clonal fragments in two distinct micro-environments (inside vegetation islands, and in the border area between bare sand and vegetation islands) in the natural habitat of A. nudicaulisand measured their growth direction in relation to the island center. We measured the growth directions of entire clonal fragments (defined as the line that connects the oldest and the youngest ramets of a clonal fragment) as well as the growth direction of the youngest internode on each fragment (the growth direction of the youngest ramet in relation to its parent ramet). We used Monte Carlo simulations to test for deviations from randomness in the growth direction of clonal fragments and individual internodes. The clonal fragments of A. nudicaulis showed a significant tendency to grow away from the center of vegetation islands. In other words, the main growth direction of clonal fragments growing inside vegetation islands or at the border between bare sand and vegetation islands was preferentially directed towards bare sand environments. Individual internodes at the border of vegetation islands also exhibited this tendency to grow towards the outside of vegetation islands, but internodes growing inside vegetation islands did not show directional growth. These results provide the first field evidence for habitat selection through directional growth of a clonal plant species...|$|E

30|$|In most cases, {{we found}} a matrix of {{surviving}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>interspersed</b> with patches of high burn severity on the landscape. Similarly, following a large fire (∼ 34, 000 ha) in Pinus ponderosa forests of the South Dakota Black Hills, large patches were often more heterogeneous in fire effects and less severely burned. Low and moderate severity patches averaged 10 ha and 24 ha, respectively, in size and were within 10 m of a green edge, while high severity patches were small, averaging 8 ha in size, and 55 % of the area that burned under high severity was within 30 m of a potential tree seed source in adjacent low or moderate severity patches (Lentile et al. 2005). In AK, even the largest patches of high burn severity included small islands of less severely burned or unburned vegetation. Odion et al. (2004) documented similarly variable mosaics of burn severities for large fires (> 1500 ha) burning from 1977 to 2002 on the Klamath National Forest, including 20 % to 82 % low, 5 % to 50 % moderate and 5 % to 45 %.|$|R

Results show that the environmental variation observed along the undisturbed-impacted gradient considered influences on fish assemblage structure. Both richness and diversity differences between fish assemblages are partially influenced by stream stretch orthonian order and anthropogenic impacts. ABC curves classified six stream stretches located in preserved or impacted areas as undisturbed while four stretches were classified as disturbed. This is attributed to the influence of the undisturbed habitat within the conservation unit and the presence of K- or r- strategist species.

It was radiocarbon dated to ca. 18, 500 14 C yr BP (ca. 22, 500 cal yr BP). Dung from the lower intestine was subjected to a multiproxy array of microscopic, chemical, and molecular techniques to reconstruct the diet, the season of death, and the paleoenvironment.

We characterised the bacterial communities of BSCs (0 ? 1 cm depth) and the subsurface soil (1 ? 2 cm depth) in an area typical of lightly grazed Kalahari rangelands, composed of grasses, shrubs, and trees. Our data add substantially to the limited amount of existing knowledge concerning BSC microbial community structure, by providing the first bacterial community analyses of both BSCs and subsurface soils of the Kalahari region based on a high throughput 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing approach. BSC bacterial communities were distinct with respect to vegetation type and soil depth, and varied in relation to soil carbon, nitrogen, and surface temperature. Cyanobacteria were predominant in the grass interspaces at the soil surface (0 ? 1 cm) but rare in subsurface soils (1 ? 2 cm depth) and under the shrubs and trees. Bacteroidetes were significantly more abundant in surface soils of all areas {{even in the absence}} of a consolidated crust, whilst subsurface soils yielded more sequences affiliated to Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. The common detection of vertical stratification, even in disturbed sites, suggests a strong potential for BSC recovery after physical disruption, however severe depletion of Cyanobacteria near trees and shrubs may limit the potential for natural BSC regeneration in heavily shrub-encroached areas. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|The climate {{regime of}} the study area is {{characterized}} by single long dry season followed by a shorter wet season. In the Sahel, mean annual rainfall is less than 500  mm and may fall to 250  mm (Ayoade 1988). In the Sudan savanna, it is 800  mm to 1000  mm. The number of wet months is about 4  months in the northern guinea savanna zone to less than 2  months in the Sahel savanna zone (Folland et al., 1986; Anyadike, 1993). Mean annual temperature is 26 oC increasing towards the Sahel zone. Potential evapo-transpiration exceeds rainfall except for the few months. Vegetation {{of the study}} area is divided into the Wooded Tropical savanna, Mixed combrataceous woodland and wooded savannah. The Wooded tropical savanna also known as Sahel savanna is found {{in the northern part of}} the state, where rainfall is less than 500  mm per annum. The vegetation consists of thorn bushes and small trees which grow under dry conditions. Mixed combrataceous woodland covers the central part {{of the study area}}. It has more rainfall than the wooded tropical savanna and it consists of scrub <b>vegetation</b> <b>interspersed</b> with tall trees (Nwaka, 1991). The wooded savanna covers most of the southern part of the state, with a higher grass growth. It is also known as northern guinea savanna. The main trees are the isoberlina species. Administratively, there are seventeen Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Yobe State. The semi-arid zone in the study comprises of the Sudan and the Sahel regions, which by its nature and characteristics are susceptible to drought and desertification. These zones are most vulnerable to drought and desertification because the predominant economic activity of the people in the communities is farming (Musa and Shaib 2010).|$|R
40|$|Semi-arid woodlands, {{which are}} characterised by patchy <b>vegetation</b> <b>interspersed</b> with bare, open areas, are {{frequently}} exposed to wild fire. During summer, long dry periods are occasionally interrupted by rainfall events. It is well-known that rewetting of dry soil induces a flush of respiration. However, {{the magnitude of}} the flush may differ between vegetation patches and open areas because of different organic matter content which could be further modulated by wild fire. Soils were collected from under trees, under shrubs or in open areas in unburnt and burnt sandy Mallee woodland, where part of the woodland experienced a wild fire which destroyed or damaged most of the aboveground plant parts four months before sampling. In an incubation experiment, the soils were exposed to two moisture treatments: constantly moist (CM) and drying and rewetting (DRW). In CM, soils were incubated at 80 % of maximum water holding capacity for 19 days; In DRW, soils were dried for four days, kept dry for another five days, then rewet to 80 % WHC and maintained at this water content until day 19. Soil respiration decreased during drying and was very low in the dry period; rewetting induced a respiration flush. Compared to soil under shrubs and in open areas, cumulative respiration per g soil in CM and DRW was greater under trees, but lower when expressed per g TOC. Organic matter content, available P, and microbial biomass C, but not available N were greater under trees than in open areas. Wild fire decreased the flush of respiration per g TOC in the open areas and under shrubs, and reduced TOC and MBC concentrations only under trees, but had little effect on available N and P concentrations. We conclude that of the impact wild fire and DRW events on nutrient cycling differ among vegetation patches of a native semiarid woodland which is related to organic matter amount and availability...|$|R
30|$|Comparing burn {{severity}} conditions across large wildfires {{burning in}} different vegetation types {{allows us to}} describe important general patterns. First, vegetation responds quickly regardless of burn severity and ecosystem. Many plants are well adapted to regrow and establish following fires, even when those fires create large patches burned with high severity. Second, vegetation species richness and percent canopy cover are highly variable among patches burned with low, moderate and high severity. While this is likely {{the result of the}} wide variation in pre-fire vegetation and other site conditions, it also reflects the fine-scale heterogeneity in fire effects within patches that are mapped using dNBR and satellite imagery. Thus, areas mapped as having low and moderate severity encompass microsites that vary from unburned to low, moderate and high severity effects. Third, for this and other reasons, dNBR is a reasonable but imperfect indicator of post-fire fire effects, particularly if it is used primarily to identify high severity fire effects on vegetation and soils, and if the interpretation of what that means is made in the context of each ecosystem. A stand-replacing fire may not be uncharacteristic and outside the evolutionary environment of a particular ecosystem, such as boreal forest. Although one year post-fire vegetation response was so highly variable that {{there were no significant differences}} among burn severity classes, the immediate post-fire effects on the soil surface did differ among burn severity classes. While it is possible percent surface char (Hudak et al. 2007) could be more useful as an ecological indicator of long-term fire effects, we will not know until we can resample these areas over time. Fourth, extensive areas within even large wildfires that burned intensely have sufficient organic material covering the soil and vegetation that responds quickly to reduce the risks to soil erosion. Further, large wildfires leave a mosaic of unburned <b>vegetation</b> <b>interspersed</b> with areas of low, moderate, and high burn severity. Our data support the approach used by many BAER teams to strategically target post-fire rehabilitation treatments on large, severely burned patches while considering other factors, such as vegetation response, slope, soil texture and resources at risk.|$|R

40|$|Carbon (C) {{biogeochemical}} cycling {{studies in}} northern peatlands, {{in particular the}} production, consumption, storage and emission of C gases (CO 2 and CH 4) over space and time between different peatland landforms can help in understanding their current and future role in the global C cycle. In some peatlands, a distinct surface patterning of <b>vegetation,</b> <b>interspersed</b> with open water pools, controls the spatial and temporal variability in CO 2 and CH 4 exchange to atmosphere. These open water pools initially develop from shallow, flooded hollows to deeper water bodies {{and at some point}} reach a limit in their depth. Observations link pool size to age and spatial location on the peatland surface and over time the proportional cover of pools increases, playing {{an important role in the}} long-term peatland C balance. The processes responsible for the production of CO 2 and CH 4 in pools remain unexplored. In particular, the contribution of pools to the peatland C balance over the timeframe of the development of a pool complex is not explained and pools are not incorporated into current peatland models. A field study was carried out to examine the exchange of CO 2 and CH 4 from pools to atmosphere and to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics in CO 2, CH 4 and DOC storage in pools of different size and spatial location. This was undertaken to improve the understanding of the processes responsible for the generation of CO 2 and CH 4 over the timescale of pool development. The empirical study was carried out during spring, summer and fall over two years in an ombrotrophic, raised bog, Quebec, Canada. A modelling component was carried out to examine the contribution of pools to the long-term peatland C balance. Measurements of dissolved concentrations and emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 from pool surfaces to atmosphere were different among pools of different sizes and spatial location. Shallow pools had consistently higher emissions of both CO 2 and CH 4 and higher water column dissolved CO 2 and DOC concentrations. Deeper pools had greater concentrations of sediment CH 4. Dissolved organic carbon in pools was allochthonous, with a greater concentrations and proportion from higher plant materials in shallow pools, likely contributing to the observed water column CO 2 concentrations and greater CO 2 emissions. All pools were supersaturated with dissolved CO 2 and CH 4 at the time of sampling, with shallow pools up to eight times atmospheric equilibrium concentrations for CO 2 and concentrations were up to one hundred times greater than CH 4, comparable to findings in other global freshwater systems. Results suggest that greater decomposition is occurring in shallow pools due to warmer water and basal sediment temperatures and increased light penetration and dissolved oxygen (00) and that greater CH 4 production and oxidation accounts for some of the differences reaching a limit at 0. 7 m deep. Even though this range of pools are not as deep as pools found on other northern peatlands, the results provide evidence for the potential processes responsible for the generation of CO 2 and CH 4 emissions to atmosphere and demonstrate that pools have a significant role in the short and long-term peatland C balance. Modelling the hypothesised processes responsible for the generation of CO 2 and CH 4 shows that if sediment decomposition is the major source of these gases then the dynamical link between pool sediments, C gas production and pool growth has been demonstrated. Ultimately their role as source or sink is largely determined by their size (depth), the proportional cover on the landscape and their rates of C storage in sediments versus rates of C uptake and exchange...|$|R
