40|$|A {{data set}} {{acquired}} {{to establish an}} <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in salt marsh sediments has been evaluated using two numerical techniques, principal component analysis and discriminant analysis. Results indicate that sites proximate to the River Thames exhibit {{a greater degree of}} contamination, and numerical analysis supports the hypothesis that the river has been the major source of contaminants to the region. The presence of the contaminants within salt marsh sediments may be of concern due to changes in flood defense techniques. The use of managed realignment, where the line of flood defense is moved back to higher ground which requires only a low, minimal cost, sea-wall protected by newly created salt marsh from former farmland, is not free from problems of historical pollution. Mature salt marsh, laid down during previous decades, may be eroded and reworked within the new coastal geomorphology created by breaching existing seawalls and what were previously considered to be sinks of pollutants may have become sources. However, evaluation of the sediment burden of PCB within the salt marshes of the U. K. Essex coast indicates that they {{are not likely to be}} a major source of pollutants should sediments be remobilized during managed realignment programs...|$|E

The gas sampling system (mini-constant volume sampling) as well as the analyzers are carried on-board the vehicle. Around 55 tests were conducted during 3 months covering more than 480 km under various real driving conditions. The mean speed downtown is about 16. 1 km/hr with a rather low acceleration, an average of 0. 60 m/sec 2. For each test, kinematics are recorded as well as the analysis of the four emitted pollutants carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and total hydrocarbons. Emission factors were evaluated according to speed for each category of gasoline and diesel engines. The influence of some parameters such as cold/hot start, age of vehicle and its state of maintenance are discussed. Results are compared with the European database ARTEMIS for comparable vehicles. These measurements {{contribute to the development of}} unit emission of the vehicles used in Algeria, which are necessary for the calculation of emission <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and greenhouse gases from the road transportation sector.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} the results of the systematic analysis of heavy metals in surficial sediments and marine molluscs from Oualidia and Sidi Moussa lagoons. The present field investigation determines baseline heavy metal conditions in two Atlantic lagoons for the purpose of prioritizing future lagoon remediation efforts. Heavy metal levels in the two lagoons were exceedingly high, but varied widely among sampling stations. PEC (probable effects concentrations) concentrations were often exceeded for heavy metals in the lagoon sediments, especially for Pb, Cd, As and Hg, and some stations had multiple metals at presumptively toxic levels. These comparisons suggest that sediment metal levels in the lagoons are clearly high and probably pose an environmental risk at some stations. Although a complete <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> inputs has not been completed, major pollutant sources have been identified and they should be given first attention in remediation efforts. Therefore, a two-tiered remediation strategy is suggested: one tier aimed at source reduction by installing wastewater purification station at Oualidia lagoon and a second tier aimed at minimizing metal re-mobilization impacts, possibly via finer-sediment dredging, as water quality improves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The European Pollutant Emission Register in Spain (EPER-Spain) is {{a public}} <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{industries}} created by decision of the European Union. The location of these industries is geocoded and the first published data correspond to 2001. Publication of these data will allow for quantification {{of the effect of}} proximity to one or more such plant on cancer and all-cause mortality observed in nearby towns. However, as errors have been detected in the geocoding of many <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> foci shown in the EPER, it was decided that a validation study should be conducted into the accuracy of these co-ordinates. EPER-Spain geographic co-ordinates were drawn from the European Environment Agency (EEA) server and the Spanish Ministry of the Environment (MOE). The Farm Plot Geographic Information System (Sistema de Información Geográfica de Parcelas Agrícolas) (SIGPAC) enables orthophotos (digitalized aerial images) of any territorial point across Spain to be obtained. Through a search of co-ordinates in the SIGPAC, all the industrial foci (except farms) were located. The quality criteria used to ascertain possible errors in industrial location were high, medium and low quality, where industries were situated at a distance of less than 500 metres, more than 500 metres but less than 1 kilometre, and more than 1 kilometre from their real locations, respectively. Results Insofar as initial registry quality was concerned, 84 % of industrial complexes were inaccurately positioned (low quality) according to EEA data versus 60 % for Spanish MOE data. The distribution of the distances between the original and corrected co-ordinates for each of the industries on the registry revealed that the median error was 2. 55 kilometres for Spain overall (according to EEA data). The Autonomous Regions that displayed most errors in industrial geocoding were Murcia, Canary Islands, Andalusia and Madrid. Correct co-ordinates were successfully allocated to 100 % of EPER-Spain industries. Conclusion Knowing the exact location <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> foci is vital to obtain reliable and valid conclusions in any study where distance to the focus is a decisive factor, {{as in the case of}} the consequences of industrial pollution on the health of neighbouring populations. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{total number}} of {{synthetic}} organic chemicals introduced to the environment by humans has never been quantified, {{but it is not}} lower than thousands. A fraction of these chemicals have toxic effects to coastal organisms and presumably affect ecosystems structure and function. During the last decades, some of the processes affecting the transport, degradation, and fate of a limited number of chemicals have been studied, and the rising concern for environmental risk of organic chemical has lead to the regulation of a few of them by national and international organisms. However, the environmental <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> is far from being quantified, and current methodologies used in most toxicological tests only allow to determine effects of individual chemicals to organisms. There are major limitations on appropriate methodologies to assess the effects <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> at population and ecosystem levels and the effects induced by complex mixtures <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> present in natural environments.

The objective {{of this study was}} to review the extent to which UK land management is accounted for as a source of emission of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), organic nitrogen (Norg), methane (CH 4), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), particulate matter (PM) and heavy metals (HM), in comparison with the current state of scientific knowledge; to ascertain whether there is evidence for significant gaps or that key emission sources have been overlooked. The processes leading to emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 are largely understood and all major sources are thought to be captured in the current <b>inventory.</b> Quantification <b>of</b> uncertainties in the estimates for some of these sources is still required, as is an assessment of the potential improvement in accuracy of estimates through the development of country-specific emission factors for N 2 O and CH 4 in particular.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a mega-city on the atmospheric boundary layer and surface conditions was examined in the complex-terrain, semi-arid Tehran region using the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM 5) during a high pollution period. In addition, model sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate {{the performance of the}} urban canopy and urban soil model "SM 2 -U (3 D) " parameterization on the meteorological fields and ground level air pollutant concentrations in this area. The topographic flows and urban effects were found to play important roles in modulating the wind and temperature fields, and the urbanized areas exerted important local effects on the boundary layer meteorology. An emission <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> and an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> heat generation were developed and updated for 2005 in this work. Emissions from on-road motor vehicles constitute a major portion <b>of</b> the emission <b>inventory</b> and play the most important role in terms of contributions <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> to the atmosphere in Tehran. By using a detailed methodology, we calculated spatial and temporal distributions of the anthropogenic heat flux (Qf) for Tehran during 2005. Wintertime Qf is larger than summertime Qf, which reflects the importance of heating emissions from buildings and traffic during cold and warm period respectively. Different urban parameterizations were used as a tool to investigate the modifications induced by the presence of an urban area in the area of interest. It was found that, for local meteorological simulations, the drag-force approach coupled with an urban soil model (DA-SM 2 -U) is preferable to the roughness approach (RA-SLAB). The comparisons indicated that the most important features of the wind, temperature and turbulent fields in urban areas are well reproduced by the DA-SM 2 -U configuration with the anthropogenic heat flux being taken into account (i. e., "DA-SM 2 -U Qf: On" option). This modeling option showed that the suburban part of the city is dominated by topographic flows whereas the center and south of Tehran are more affected by urban heat island (UHI) forcing especially during the night. The chemical transport modeling, including a model sensitivity study, was used to investigate the impact of the different urban parameterization on the dispersion and formation <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> over the Tehran region.

The inventory is established for the reference year 2000 and it has 10 km spatial resolution. Annual anthropogenic emission data obtained from official national emission inventories and from international emission databases were spatially disaggregated and allocated to a gridded domain using the top-down methodology. Source specific temporal profiles were used in order monthly and hourly emission data to be estimated. In the study area, the highest NOx amounts are emitted by the maritime and road transport sectors. Road transport has a prominent role in anthropogenic NMVOCs emissions followed by the solvent and other product use sector. The main CO emission sources are represented by the road transport sector and the non-industrial combustion plants. In the present study, the contribution of the transport sector to the total emissions <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> over urban and non-urban areas of Greece is investigated. Over almost all Greek urban areas, road transport is the major NMVOCs and CO emission source. Road transport contribution to NOx emissions is greater than 50 % at the large urban centres of Greece.

Most {{of this is}} applied to agricultural land, {{which can lead to}} considerable inputs <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants,</b> such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to soil. This paper presents an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> situation in source-separated composts, digestates and presswater in Switzerland by a detailed analysis of over 70 samples. PCB concentrations (PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) were significantly higher in urban (median: 30 µg kg– 1 dw, n = 52) than in rural samples (median: 14 µg kg– 1 dw, n = 16). Together with low concentrations in general, this points to aerial deposition on compost input material as the major contamination pathway. Enantiomeric fractions of atropisometric PCB were close to racemic. Median PAH concentration was 3010 µg kg– 1 dw (15 PAH, n = 69), and one quarter of the samples exhibited concentrations above the relevant Swiss guide value for compost (4000 µg kg– 1 dw). The levels were influenced by the treatment process (digestate > compost), the season of input material collection (spring–summer > winter > autumn), the particle size (coarse-grained > fine-grained), and maturity (mature > less mature). The main source of PAH in compost was pyrogenic, probably influenced mainly by liquid fossil fuel combustion and some asphalt abrasion, as suggested by multiple linear regression. This study, together with a companion paper reporting on other organic contaminates including emerging compound classes, provides a starting point for a better risk-benefit estimation of the application of compost and digestate to agricultural soil in Switzerland...|$|R

The 188 federally listed HAPs present a 30 -fold {{increase in the number}} of HAPs that must be tracked as compared to the Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs). Few additional resources are available for HAP inventories, so air agencies need to focus on the HAPs that contribute significant risk. Typically, modeling is necessary to understand which HAPs present the greatest health risks, and accurate modeling is depends on a high quality inventory. To resolve this conundrum, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) has successfully used a Toxicity-Weighting tool to focus inventory resources towards those HAPs that are likely to be of greatest concern. The risk posed by a HAP depends upon exposure concentration (the amount of HAP in the air that is breathed), the amount breathed, and the toxicity of the HAP. Toxicity Factors for HAPs are based on the toxicity of each HAP and constants that help determine HAP intake. HAP emissions are a significant factor in determining exposure concentration. Therefore, the toxicity-factor is multiplied by HAP emissions, to derive a relative ranking of HAPs. Emissio...|$|R

Emissions are estimated for all major anthropogenic sources, including biomass burning, in 64 regions of Asia. We estimate total Asian emissions as follows: 34. 3 Tg SO 2, 26. 8 Tg NOx, 9870 Tg CO 2, 279 Tg CO, 107 Tg CH 4, 52. 2 Tg NMVOC, 2. 54 Tg black carbon (BC), 10. 4 Tg organic carbon (OC), and 27. 5 Tg NH 3. In addition, NMVOC are speciated into 19 subcategories according to functional groups and reactivity. Thus {{we are able to}} identify the major source regions and types for many of the significant gaseous and particle emissions that influence pollutant concentrations {{in the vicinity of the}} TRACE-P and ACE-Asia field measurements. Emissions in China dominate the signature <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations in this region, so special emphasis has been placed on the development of emission estimates for China. China's emissions are determined to be as follows: 20. 4 Tg SO 2, 11. 4 Tg NOx, 3820 Tg CO 2, 116 Tg CO, 38. 4 Tg CH 4, 17. 4 Tg NMVOC, 1. 05 Tg BC, 3. 4 Tg OC, and 13. 6 Tg NH 3. Emissions are gridded at a variety of spatial resolutions from 1 ° ⨯ 1 ° to 30 s ⨯ 30 s, using the exact locations of large point sources and surrogate GIS distributions of urban and rural population, road networks, landcover, ship lanes, etc. The gridded emission estimates have been used as inputs to atmospheric simulation models and have proven to be generally robust in comparison with field observations, though there is reason to think that emissions of CO and possibly BC may be underestimated. Monthly emission estimates for China are developed for each species to aid TRACE-P and ACE-Asia data interpretation. During the observation period of March/April, emissions are roughly at their average values (one twelfth of annual).

40|$|One {{part of this}} {{research}} project is to compile an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen and phosphorous emissions deriving from direct industrial disposal in the Federal Republic <b>of</b> Germany; the <b>inventory</b> shall contain categories according to the single trades and to the different river areas. The main aim was to record the status of these emissions {{in order to be}} able to check the emission of those companies which an conspicuous for their production and direct disposal of nitrogen and phosphorous, and thus to comply with the demand for a reduction by 50 % of nutrient emission which was required by the International North Sea Protection Conference. In order to achieve the protection of both North Sea and Baltic Sea, the countries bordering these oceans have for several years been bound by international European contracts to report such emissions; these contracts aim at detailed <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> all <b>pollutants.</b> These <b>inventories</b> in turn serve to formulate purposeful measures for the reduction of these emissions. For the FRG, the report presents the demands on the compilation <b>of</b> emission <b>inventories</b> and the current state of data compilation and processing. In spite of the clean defined demands, it became apparent that the amount of available data is insufficient, in particular in regard to direct industrial diposal. The situation is due on the one hand to the inadequate data compilation by the authorities, in particular in regard to gathering reports from those companies, who do direct industrial disposal, and on the other hand to the generally insufficient willingness to publish data which are relevant to the protection of the environment, especially those which touch on direct industrial disposal. Previous data about the nutrient discharges of companies who do direct industrial disposal have often been culled mainly from estimations, the basis of which was not at all obvious. In contrast, the present research project has yielded an initial approach to achieve the recording of the actual induction of nitrogen and phosphorous of direct industrial disposal. Initial estimations of the nitrogen and phosphorous emission of companies who do direct industrial disposal is possible. In regard to the data made available in this report and to the deficits of data having been published by the auhtorities, the next step should be to try for the completion of the data material by another in-depth questioning of the relevant authorities.

40|$|For {{some years}} now, {{problems}} relating to gas emissions that affect climate and result from human activities have assumed a global dimension of large importance. The climate is, indeed, {{influenced by the}} concentrations <b>of</b> some <b>pollutants</b> in the atmosphere; these pollutants trap the long wave radiation emitted by the Earth and alter the energy balance, causing an accentuation of the natural greenhouse effect. In this view an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gases can become the benchmark against which to measure the achievement of quantitative targets set at the political level {{in the fight against}} climate change. Contrary to a general <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> emissions related with air quality objectives and local effects <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> a greenhouse gas inventory does not set objectives purely local, but it directs efforts towards the quantification of the liability of an area compared to a global problem as climate change, also in view of possible improvements. The inventory is thus the reference for the evaluation of pre-and post-operam actions aimed at reducing the greenhouse effect as well as for their monitoring over time. The article in an overview of the main issues of air pollution associated with airport operations and a review of the airport sources and components contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. After an brief description of the most recent international and national standard and recommendations on this topic, the article focuses on reasons for developing a greenhouse gas emission inventories and traces the essential elements in the methodology to be followed by airport operators for preparing an airport-specific <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas emissions. Methods for calculating emissions are also summarized and reviewed. Finally, the new references to the environmental sustainability at airports, as well as the main measures to be taken to reduce emissions are also identified and commented on. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: On-road traffic {{represents}} the {{largest source of}} pollutants’ emissions in urban areas. In southern Mediterranean countries exceedances of the NO 2 and PM 10 European air quality targets are observed in urban environments. Moreover the budget of urban emissions contributes to the emissions of O 3 precursors (mainly NOx) {{in a region where}} the concentration <b>of</b> photochemical <b>pollutants</b> still remains a problem especially during summertime. Air quality modeling, used as a management tool, permits to test abatement emissions strategies in advance. Nowadays, the substitution of vehicles by introducing new technologies (e. g. cleaner fuels, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells) or alternative fuels (e. g. biofuels, natural gas or hydrogen) is a common practice in conurbations around Europe. This work focuses on the assessment of the impacts on air quality due to the introduction of hybrid cars in the largest urban areas of Spain: Madrid (within a more continental environment), and the urban coastal city of Barcelona. The WRFARW/ HERMES/CMAQ modeling system has been implemented and validated with a high resolution (1 km 2 and 1 hr) thanks to the calculation power of the MareNostrum supercomputer (94. 21 TFlops peak). Due to the complex topography and climatic particularities of the study areas it becomes necessary to use high spatial and temporal resolution and to have a highly-disaggregated emission <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> gaseous <b>pollutants</b> and particulate matter (HERMES model developed specifically for Spain). The model was applied during a representative summertime polluted episode. The introduction of a 10 % or a 30 % of hybrid cars in substitution of the oldest petrol and diesel cars of both cities proved to be effective to reduce NO 2, SO 2 and PM 10 concentrations in the conurbations (i. e. a 37 % reduction in NO 2 24 -hr average concentration occurs in Madrid and a 18 % in Barcelona when introducing a 30 % of hybrid vehicles; moreover 24 -hr average PM 10 decreases up to 12 % and 14 % in Madrid and Barcelona, respectively). Nevertheless the O 3 concentrations slightly arise (being the 8 -hr average concentration a 3 % higher in Madrid and a 24 % in Barcelona respect to the base case). The selected domains present a similar behavior with respect to their impacts, with a noticeable reduction of ground-level NOx in downtown areas and an increase in the tropospheric ozone concentration in the VOC-limited areas. In downwind locations the precursors’ emissions control causes a reduction of O 3 levels. The air quality modeling system proves to be a suitable and useful tool to manage urban air quality, especially when applied with this high resolution...|$|R
