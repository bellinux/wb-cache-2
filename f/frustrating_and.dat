5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and <b>frustrating,</b> <b>and</b> the story trite.|$|E
5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that}} they were unfit to bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> {{impractical}} since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E

5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

She described the experience as <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> said she ended up praying to God that she never be put in a position of authority over others.|$|E

25|$|Off Beat is {{hand-drawn}} by Quick on Bristol {{paper with}} mechanical pencil, micron pens, India ink and brush. Initially, toning {{was done by}} hand, but issues with moiré led Quick to screentone using Adobe Photoshop, with each page checked by her editor in light of persistent problems. While freelancing for Central Park Media, she found lettering with Adobe Illustrator <b>frustrating,</b> <b>and</b> opted to have Tokyopop's Vanessa Satone oversee the process for Off Beat instead.|$|E
25|$|Abe's {{encounter}} with the geisha world {{proved to be a}} <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted syphilis. Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.|$|E
25|$|This affair instigated public {{discussion}} and was {{often referred to}} as 'scandalous'. Whether Lokhvitskaya and Balmont had ever been physically close, remained unclear. Some suggested they might have had a short affair in the early days; in the later years even in the geographical terms both were wide apart, with Balmont spending much of his time abroad. In his autobiography At the Dawn (На заре) he described their relationship as 'poetic friendship'. Modern literary historians consider their relationship to have been truly platonic affair, albeit violently passionate, <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> psychologically detrimental for both.|$|E

25|$|MDK2 {{received}} generally positive reviews {{across all}} systems, with critics praising the graphics, variety of gameplay styles, level design, boss fights, the game's sense of humor, and its {{fidelity to the}} original MDK. The most commonly criticized aspects of the game were the difficulty level, which was felt to be too high, and the platforming sections, which many critics found <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> too exacting. Hawkins' levels in general were seen as inferior to Kurt's and Max's. In 2007, Interplay announced plans for a third game, {{but it was never}} made.|$|E
25|$|Burns {{taught at}} Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the {{educational}} field, she generally found {{the experience to}} be <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns {{was fortunate enough to}} have a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.|$|E
500|$|Brad Steirn from MuuMuse {{named it}} [...] "dud", while Michael Cragg from musicOMH called it [...] "dated". Omar Kholeif of PopMatters wrote a {{negative}} review, stating [...] "Christina isn't afraid to shake, thrust, and hustle, as she professes on 'Glam', an obvious homage to 'Vogue' that isn't nearly as catchy or sultry as it thinks it is." [...] Jordan Richardson from Blogcritics agreed, writing that [...] "The track is a <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> uncomfortable ode to Madonna's 'Vogue,' but Aguilera fails in recreating {{any of the}} slinkiness of the track she's trying to emulate".|$|E

500|$|Criticism {{about the}} {{gameplay}} was mixed. Many reviews {{complained that the}} camera was at times <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> the Gummi Ship portions were out of place. GameSpot cited [...] "tedious" [...] gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as [...] "pale imitations of the Star Fox series", but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights. Dengeki Online commented on the camera controls, saying that the camera would often run into objects while being rotated by the player. GamePro compared the battle system to [...] "old N64 Zelda games" [...] and had positive comments about Donald and Goofy's artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|After {{designing}} the [...] (2007), which intentionally replicated {{elements of the}} first installment, Climax Studios wanted to try {{a different approach to}} creating a title in the series. Among the changes made was the removal of combat and the constant presence of monsters. Akira Yamaoka composed the soundtrack of the game, which was the first in the series to prominently feature dynamic music. The game received generally positive reviews, and its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote were praised by reviewers. Some reviewers criticized Shattered Memories chase sequences and duration, which they deemed potentially <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> short.|$|E
500|$|Christmas Lemmings, {{also known}} as Holiday Lemmings, was also {{released}} {{as a series of}} short games released between 1991 and 1994. The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game, which is not required. First released as Xmas Lemmings as two four-level demos in 1991 and 1992, there were two later full retail releases on the Amiga and Atari ST in 1993 and 1994, both with an additional 32 levels. The games were well-received; Rob Mead of Amiga Format described it as [...] "funny, <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> incredibly addictive", despite being disappointed by the number of levels, and Will Greenwald of PC Magazine ranked it among the best Christmas video games in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} {{traditional}} balancing, soft balancing is undertaken not to physically shift {{the balance of}} power but to undermine, <b>frustrate,</b> <b>and</b> increase the cost of unilateral action for the stronger state. Soft balancing is not undertaken via military effort, but via a combination of economic, diplomatic and institutional methods. In other words, soft balancing uses [...] "non-military tools to delay, <b>frustrate</b> <b>and</b> undermine aggressive unilateral U.S. military policies". Being non-military, soft balancing is regarded as ineffective: “Soft” balancing is “balancing that does not balance at all.” ...|$|R

Other gay cast members included Dennis Price and Hilton Edwards.|$|R
500|$|Under this {{arrangement}} Etty {{did not receive}} formal tuition from Lawrence. Instead, Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures, and agreed to answer Etty's questions {{when he was in}} a position to do so. Etty found the experience of trying to copy Lawrence's work extremely <b>frustrating,</b> <b>and</b> in his own words [...] "was ready to run away", but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence's work very closely. Although Etty found his year with Lawrence a frustrating experience, his development of the ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from the Old Masters.|$|E
500|$|When {{returning}} to the fundamental and original game concept—pairing tiles as multiples of three—the developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions. The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version, as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired. For example, the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch. Wohlwend {{has said that the}} number tiles grow in character with their size. The idea for character faces beneath the cards remained from previous theme iterations, and the character voices were provided by indie game developers. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it [...] "tough and <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> sometimes hard {{to see if it was}} worth it". Vollmer credited thatgamecompany for teaching him applicable lessons of restraint during his time there.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} {{selling points}} of Bloodmoon was its {{reintegration}} of werewolves, a feature that had been included in Daggerfall, but was absent in Morrowind, despite being a feature prominently advertised in previews prior to the game's release. [...] Morrowind instead included vampirism, which was almost an [...] "Easter egg" [...] {{in terms of how}} many players remained unfamiliar with the feature. Players become werewolves by catching the lycanthropic disease [...] "Sanies Lupinus" [...] and letting three days pass without getting it cured. Once the disease has been fully integrated, the player transforms every night, regardless of the lunar cycle. Being a werewolf provides ability increases, though their strength was reduced relative to the major bonuses offered by lycanthropy in Daggerfall. Some reviewers found the addition a welcome challenge, but others thought it <b>frustrating</b> <b>and</b> poorly implemented.|$|E
