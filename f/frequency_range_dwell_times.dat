With nitrogen background gas the plume expansion will be slowed down due to collisions between vapor species and the gas atoms [15]. Moreover, condensation of vapor present in the plasma leads to nanoparticles generation [5, 16]. The temperature of these nanoparticles is high enough to attach with the fibers. Hence, condensation is not playing a significant role in nanofiber generation. Since the repetition rate is in MHz <b>range,</b> laser <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> (interaction time) also plays a role in nanofiber growth.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) synthesis that remains {{an obstacle to}} realize industrial mass production is the growth efficiency. Many approaches {{have been reported to}} improve the efficiency, either by lengthening the catalyst lifetime or by increasing the growth rate. We investigated the applicability of <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> and carbon flux control to optimize yield, growth rate, and catalyst lifetime of water-assisted chemical vapor deposition of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) forests using acetylene as a carbon feedstock.

Through a systematic study spanning a wide <b>range</b> of <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> and carbon flux levels, the relationship of the height, growth rate, and catalyst lifetime is found. Further, for the optimum conditions for 10 min growth, SWCNT forests with ~ 2500 μm height, ~ 350 μm/min initial growth rates and extended lifetimes could be achieved by increasing the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> to ~ 5 s, demonstrating the generality of <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> control to highly reactive gases...|$|R

However, there are still unsolved issues in the volume productions using ACFs. The main {{reason is that the}} effects of many factors on the interconnects are not well understood. This work focuses on the performance of ACF-bonded chip-on-flex assemblies subjected to a range of thermal cycling test conditions.

30|$|A first remark {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the travel demand (in terms of arrival rate) in a station and the related <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> Indeed, although Eq. (1) shows the direct dependence of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on travel demand (i.e. the higher the travel demand, the higher the <b>dwell</b> <b>time),</b> Eq. (3) (or, equivalently, Eq.  4) shows the direct dependence of travel demand on headway which, by means of Eq. (2), in turn depends on <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in previous stations. Hence, the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> in a station {{is a function of the}} arrival rate in that station, the arrival rates in the previous stations and the framework of the travel demand (in terms of alighting flows).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the factors that determine the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in a visual search task, that is, the duration the gaze remains fixated on an object. It {{has been suggested that}} an item’s similarity to the search target should be an important determiner of <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> because <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are taken to reflect the time needed to reject the item as a distractor, and such discriminations are supposed to be harder the more similar an item is to the search target. In line with this similarity view, a previous study shows that, in search for a target ring of thin line-width, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin linewidth Landolt C’s distractors were longer than <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on Landolt C’s with thick or medium linewidth. However, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> may have been longer on thin Landolt C’s because the thin line-width made it harder to detect whether the stimuli had a gap or not. Thus, it is an open question whether <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin line-width distractors were longer because they were similar to the target or because the perceptual decision was more difficult. The present study de-coupled similarity from perceptual difficulty, by measuring <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> on thin, medium and thick line-width distractors when the target had thin, medium or thick line-width. The results showed that <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were longer on target-similar than target-dissimilar stimuli across all target conditions and regardless of the line-width.

40|$|Purpose: Dose plans {{generated}} with optimization models hitherto used in HDR brachytherapy {{have shown}} a tendency to yield longer <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> than manually optimized plans. Concern has been raised for the corresponding undesired hot spots and various methods to mitigate these have been developed. The hypotheses of this work are a) that one cause for the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> {{is the use of}} objective functions comprising simple linear penalties and b) that alternative penalties, being piecewise linear, would lead to reduced length of individual <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> Methods: The characteristics of the linear penalties and the piecewise linear penalties are analysed mathematically. Experimental comparisons between the two types of penalties are carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients. Results: While most dose-volume parameters do not differ significantly between the two types of penalties significant changes {{can be seen in the}} <b>dwell</b> <b>times.</b> On the average, total <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> were reduced by 4. 2 %, with a reduction of maximum <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> by 30 %, using the alternative penalties.

By introducing alternative penalties significant reduction in <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> can be achieved for HDR brachytherapy dose plans. Although various constraints as to reduce the long <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> have been developed our finding is of fundamental interest in showing the shape of the objective function to be one reason for their appearance...|$|R
40|$|Train <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unpredictable}} components of railway operations mainly due to the varying volumes of alighting and boarding passengers. For reliable estimations of train running times and route conflicts on main lines it is however necessary to obtain accurate estimations of <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at the intermediate stops on the main line, the so-called short stops. This is a big challenge for a more reliable, efficient and robust train operation. Previous research has shown that <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> is highly dependent on the number of boarding and alighting passengers. However, the latter numbers are usually not available in real time. This paper discusses the possibility of a <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> estimation model at short stops without passenger demand information, by means of a statistical analysis of track occupation data from the Netherlands. The analysis showed that the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are best estimated for peak and off-peak hour separately. The peak hour <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are estimated using a linear regression model of train length, <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> at previous stops and <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> of the previous trains. The off-peak hour <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> are estimated using a non-parametric regression model. There are two major advantages of the proposed estimation model. The model does not need passenger flow data which is usually impossible to know in real time in practice.
