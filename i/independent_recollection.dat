S. laws regarding {{the age at which}} minors may consent to confidential treatment for abuse of illegal substances was highlighted. This article reports the results of an investigation of the information used by legislators to determine the age at which minors may consent to treatment. Evidence indicates that in four states lawmakers considered the advice of mental health professionals before making age determinations. In six states “consistency with other state laws ” or “precedence ” was the lawmakers ’ major consideration. In five states, the main concern was removing legal barriers to treatment access. Lawmakers from several states had no <b>independent</b> <b>recollection</b> regarding the motives behind age selection. When deciding on the age at which minors would be allowed to consent to substance abuse treatment, some state legislators based their decisions on clinical data or legal facts. Some, however, appear to have made decisions without a clear foundation. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 35 : 317 – 22, 2007 In a recent publication, the lack of consensus among U. S. laws as to the age at which a minor may consent to confidential treatment for alcohol and drug abuse was underscored. 1 Several states ’ statutes indicate that confidential treatment should be available t...|$|E
40|$|Gender {{differences}} {{in the content of}} preschool children’s recollections: A longitudinal study Pirko Tõugu, 1 Tiia Tulviste, 1 and Kristi Suits 1 Personal recollections constitute autobiographical memory that develops intensively during the preschool years. The two-wave longitu-dinal study focuses on gender {{differences in}} preschool children’s <b>independent</b> <b>recollections.</b> The same children (N 275; 140 boys, 135 girls) were asked to talk about their previous birthday and the past weekend at the ages of 4 and 6. Interactions were coded for con-tent. Boys talked more about themselves and about different nonsocial aspects of the events. Girls talked more about the other people with whom they had jointly experienced the past event. It seems that gender differences in children’s recollections appear early and increase during the preschool period. Keywords autobiographical memory, gender differences, preschool children, recounting *This article accepted during Marcel van Aken’s term as Editor-in-Chief. Personal recollections constitute autobiographical memory and are important for one’s self. Autobiographical memory develops during the preschool years when children learn to provide accounts of them-selves and their experience. During the preschool years, the ability to narrate one’s past experience undergoes refinement and the stories providedbecomemoredetailed, elaborate, andprecise (Haden,Haine...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{debate in the}} adult literature on whether recognition memory can better be explained by a single- or a dual-process account. Single-process accounts assume that a single memory strength signal underlies recognition. Dual-process accounts propose two <b>independent</b> processes, namely <b>recollection</b> (slow and associated with contextual details) and familiarity (fast and automatic). The aim of this dissertation was to advance this debate using a cognitive developmental approach. By investigating age-related changes of recognition memory across childhood {{as a function of}} theoretically motivated experimental manipulations, predictions drawn from single- and dual-process models of recognition memory were tested. We adapted the Process Dissociation Paradigm (PDP; Jacoby, 1991) to disentangle processes underlying recognition memory in 5 -, 7 -, and 11 -year-olds and adults using a Dual-Process Signal Detection cognitive modelling approach (DPSD; Yonelinas, 1996). Experiments 1 – 6 demonstrated that 5 -year-olds are able to recollect items based on perceptual details. Consistent with dual-process theory, across all age groups a response time limit decreased recollection while leaving familiarity unaffected (Chapter 2). Converging evidence consistent with dissociations during childhood was found after repeated item presentation (Chapter 3). Finally, after a thorough empirical validation of our approach, the new paradigm was used to investigate the developmental perceptual to semantic shift (Chapter 4). These findings, using a double dissociation logic, have advanced the theoretical debate on the nature of recognition memory by showing that one process is insufficient to account for the developmental and experimental findings reported here. Recollection and familiarity follow different developmental trajectories and are affected by encoding and retrieval manipulations (i. e., repetition and time limits). This provides a challenge for existing theories of recognition memory...|$|R
40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) is {{a complex}} neurological condition associated {{with a variety of}} memory problems. This thesis attempted to elucidate {{the nature and extent of}} memory impairments further in this clinical group by drawing on dual-process theory of memory (Tulving, 1985; Jacoby, 1991; Yonelinas, 1994). This theory asserts that memory is subserved by two interrelated but <b>independent</b> memory processes. <b>Recollection</b> involves the vivid retrieval of contextual and associative information from memory. Conversely, familiarity involves recognition in the absence of this contextual information. The novel approach taken in this work was to compare paradigms that assess participants’ objective and strategic use of these two processes with measures of people’s subjective experience of their memory. Chapter 2 set the scene by presenting the extent of objective memory impairment in the current patient sample by means of standardised neuropsychological testing. Chapter 3 – 5 assessed subjective and objective recollection in anterograde recognition memory tasks. Chapter 3 showed that patients’ subjective experience of remembering may be driven by qualitatively different types of information to healthy adults. Chapter 4 demonstrated that patients were impaired in their strategic use of recollection and concurrently showed reduced levels of subjective remembering. This demonstrated that patients can be consciously aware of deficits in underlying cognitive processes contributing to memory performance. Chapter 5 specifically examined a metacognitive account of this recollection deficit. Patients were found to have impairments in a number of measures that index relational binding ability. However, their subjective confidence was assigned appropriately; they were lesser confident in their recognition judgments overall and adjusted this confidence in line with the difficulty of materials and task demands comparably to controls. Chapter 6 took a more naturalistic approach and assessed self-reported memory complaint as well as retrograde memory for salient public news events. As expected, people with TLE subjectively complained of dissatisfaction with their day-to-day to memory. The public events task revealed that although patients had reductions in subjective measures associated with recollecting the events, they were just as able as controls to accurately date the news items and monitor their memory for these. Chapter 7 found correlations between a variety of the subjective and objective recollection scores derived in the various tasks. This thesis provides confirmatory evidence that memory impairment in TLE is characterised by disordered recollection and recollective experience. Several important theoretical and clinical applications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
