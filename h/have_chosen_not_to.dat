5|$|Local {{forecast}} {{offices of}} the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential severe weather threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> outline marginal risk areas.|$|E

In response, the MTO put {{the operation of the}} full network of service centres out for tender, resulting in a 50-year lease with Host Kilmer Service Centres, a joint venture between hospitality company HMSHost (a subsidiary of Autogrill) and Larry Tanenbaum's investment company Kilmer van Nostrand, which operates the rest areas under the ONroute brand.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, {{and they may have}} considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

25|$|Metro Transit is {{the primary}} public {{transportation}} operator in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area of the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest operator in the state. The system is {{a division of the}} Metropolitan Council, the region’s metropolitan planning organization (MPO), averaging 267,700 riders each weekday, carrying 90% to 95% of the transit riders in the region on a combined network of regular-route buses, light rail and commuter rail. The remainder of transit ridership is generally split among suburban “opt-out” carriers operating out of cities that <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Metro Transit network. The biggest opt-out providers are Minnesota Valley Transit Authority (MVTA), Maple Grove Transit and Southwest Transit (SW Transit). The University of Minnesota also operates a campus shuttle system of its own, which ranks second in the state, measured by ridership.|$|E
25|$|The Heritage Cup with Seattle Sounders FC {{was begun}} in the 2009 MLS season by the {{respective}} supporters' groups. Any present or future MLS teams that carry on {{the names of their}} NASL predecessors are eligible for the Cup, but supporters of the other eligible MLS teams (Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps) <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate. San Jose and Seattle have had a rivalry since the NASL. However, it did not completely resurface during the 2009 season with fans of both teams viewing other clubs as bigger rivals. That season, the first MLS meeting of the teams was not considered for the competition due to the schedule consisting of two games in Seattle and only one in San Jose. Seattle won the initial meeting at home 2–0 and the second 2–1. The Earthquakes won the inaugural cup on goals scored after a 4–0 home victory on August 2, 2009.|$|E

25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might help explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker is {{required}} to perform his or her office impartially, but does not resign {{from his or her}} party membership upon taking office, as is done in the United Kingdom. Speaker Lucien Lamoureux decided to follow the custom of the Speaker of the British House of Commons and ran in the 1968 election as an independent. Both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party agreed not to run candidates against him. The New Democratic Party, however, declined to withdraw their candidate. Lamoureux was re-elected and continued to serve as Speaker. However, in the 1972 election, the opposition parties did not come to an agreement and ran candidates against him. Lamoureux was again returned but no subsequent Speakers have repeated his attempt to run as an independent. The opposition parties may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> follow the 1968 precedent because of how close the election was: it produced a Liberal minority government with just two more seats than the Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|No {{information}} about harbours or other landing-places {{was available to}} the Romans before Caesar's expeditions, so Caesar {{was able to make}} discoveries of benefit to Roman military and trading interests. Volusenus's reconnaissance voyage before the first expedition apparently identified the natural harbour at Dubris (Dover), although Caesar was prevented from landing there and forced to land on an open beach, as he did again the following year, perhaps because Dover was too small for his much larger forces. The great natural harbours further up the coast at Rutupiae (Richborough), which were used by Claudius for his invasion 100 years later, were not used on either occasion. Caesar may have been unaware of them, may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use them, or they may not have existed in a form suitable for sheltering and landing such a large force at that time. Present knowledge of the period geomorphology of the Wantsum Channel that created that haven is limited.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the emperor}} Vespasian, the Roman {{constitution}} began a slide toward outright monarchy. Vespasian appointed citizens throughout the empire to the senate, and granted many more citizenship. Before Vespasian, one usually {{had to be}} elected to a magisterial office before they could become a senator. Since the senate elected individuals to magisterial offices, the senate controlled its own membership, but under Vespasian, the senate lost this power. This act alone weakened the prestige, and thus the power, of both {{the senate and the}} magisterial offices. Under Vespasian, the senate returned to its original role as an advisory council. Vespasian's reforms, however, did a great deal to strengthen the empire. The honors which the emperor now bestowed upon citizens were highly sought after. Individuals who had received such honors were proud of them, and as a consequence became more loyal to the emperor, while individuals who had not yet received such honors sought to earn them. Several future emperors (such as Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius) emerged as a consequence of these reforms. Despite the success that Vespasian had in strengthening the empire, he failed {{to address the issue of}} succession, although he may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> address this issue because, with two sons, he was easily able to secure the accession of his own successor. He had made his son, Titus, his colleague in both the Consulship and the Censorship, granted him the tribunician powers, and following his successes in Judea, granted him the honorary title of imperator. Vespasian died in 79.|$|E
500|$|Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{published}} anonymously with the credit granted to [...] "a Bostonian". His name, typically listed as [...] "Edgar A.

Poe may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give his name so that his foster father, John Allan, would not know where he was; moreover, his choice to embrace his Bostonian heritage {{may have been an}} attempt to distance himself from the Allan family in Richmond.

500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{described}} the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic, [...] while others have described it as both [...] "outright commercialism" [...] and an infomercial. The Federal Communications Commission has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the First Amendment and stating that [...] "sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium" [...] were not broadcast. [...] In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie. [...] This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve the TV-14 rating. [...] In 2002, the National Organization for Women protested the show calling it a [...] "soft-core porn infomercial." [...] They were joined in protest by the Parents Television Council and other watchdog organizations. [...] CBS has given past shows TV-14 ratings, which is a warning that the show may contain material unsuitable for children age 14 and under. [...] Nonetheless some affiliates <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> air the show in past years including Fisher Broadcasting affiliates in Idaho. [...] In 2009, the American Decency Association organized email letters of protests to sponsors of the show including AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Netflix, Nikon, and Reebok.
