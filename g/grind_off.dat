50|$|For {{somewhat}} more distressed roads, a chip seal or similar surface treatment may be applied. As the number, width {{and length of}} cracks increases, more intensive repairs are needed.

If the ruts are formed due to deformation of the subbase below the pavement, the only long-term repair is usually full-depth reconstruction of the road.|$|R
6000|$|The Microscope, {{which for}} the most part I made use of, was shap'd [...] much like that in the sixth Figure of the first Scheme, the Tube [...] being {{for the most part}} not above six or seven inches long, though, by [...] reason it had four Drawers, it could very much be lengthened, as [...] {{occasion}} required; this was contriv'd with three Glasses; a small [...] Object Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one [...] about C: this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an [...] Object at once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of [...] radiating Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon [...] the deep Eye Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small [...] parts of a Body more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only [...] made use of one Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer [...] the Refractions are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And [...] therefore 'tis not to be doubted, but could we make a Microscope to [...] have one only refraction, it would, cæteris paribus, far excel any [...] other that had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a [...] very clear piece of a broken Venice Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out [...] into very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these [...] threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul, [...] or drop, which will hang {{at the end of the}} thread; and if further you [...] stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing [...] Wax, so as that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone [...] first <b>grind</b> <b>off</b> a good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal [...] plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very [...] smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft Wax against a small [...] needle hole, prick'd through a thin Plate of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or [...] any other Metal, and an Object, plac'd very near, be look'd at through [...] it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more distinct then any [...] of the great Microscopes. But because these, though exceeding easily [...] made, are yet very troublesome to be us'd, because of their smallness, [...] and the nearness of the Object; therefore to prevent both these, and [...] yet have only two Refractions, I provided me a Tube of Brass, shap'd [...] much like that in the fourth Figure of the first Scheme; into the [...] smaller end of this I fixt with Wax a good plano convex Object Glass, [...] with the convex side towards the Object, and into the bigger end I fixt [...] also with wax a pretty large plano Convex Glass, with the convex [...] side towards my eye, then by means of the small hole by the side, I [...] fill'd the intermediate space between these two Glasses with very clear [...] Water, and with a Screw stopp'd it in; then putting on a Cell for the [...] Eye, I could perceive an Object more bright then I could when the [...] intermediate space was only fill'd with Air, but this, for other [...] inconveniences, I made but little use of.|$|E

40|$|LITHUANIAN-LATVIAN ETYMOLOGIES Summary Latv. buôzt “bristle” {{seems to}} be derived from the noun Latv. buõze “stiek, club with a thick end”. Latv. buõze and Lith. búožė “knob, stick, club with a thick end; flail etc. ” are {{apparently}} connected with Latv. bâzt “put, set, stick, fix”, Lith. božóti “slice”, Latv. bêzt 2 “shoot, scratch, shuffle” (concerning their meaning cf. Lith. bèsti “stick” and Latv. best “dig, spade”). Some pa­rallels, cf. Lith. žiáunos “branchia, gills”, Latv. žaũnas “gills; jaw; mouth” and OCS žują “I chew, masticate”; Goth, munþs, OE mūth “mouth” and Lat. mando “I chew, masticate, eat, bite”, show that Lith. burnà “mouth” (Latv. pur̂ns “muzzle; snout” is supposed to be from *burn -) goes back to the Baltic root *b-H- “rub, grate, grind; chew, masticate” attested in Latv. bur̂nît,”squeeze, pinch, crumple, rub”, bur̂zît, bur̂zêt “rub, crumble, crease”, Lith. bir̃žti “to make a sign in a soil with the foot so that a sower could see how wide to sow”, Latv. bêrzt “rub, scrub, wash, chafe”. Lith. čáižyti and čiáužyti “lash, switch, whip” are derivatives of Lith. číežti “lash, whip”, čéižti “to litter” and respectively čiaũžti “slide, glide”. Latv. drīzs “fast, quick, swift; soon” can be identified with Lith. drỹžti “tear”, dríežti “tear”. For their semantical connection some evidence is furnished by Lith. dréngti “wear, tear; rub, <b>grind</b> <b>off,</b> file off; hurry, make haste”; Lith. griẽti “snatch, seize, grasp, grab, tear; skim the milk, take the cream off; drive etc. ” Lith. greĩtas “quick, rapid, fast; prompt, speedy; near”, Latv. griets “quick, fast, swift; rapid, prompt”; OHG rase, OE rash “quick, fast, rapid”: Ir. rethim “Irun. ” Lith. gubyti “toss, beat, flog” wich corresponds to Latv. gubît “rob, steal, plunder etc. ” provides an internal connection with Lith. gùbti “become hollow, sunken”, gaũbti “bend, turn outwards; rob, plunder”. Lith. kam̃pas “handle, grip; shaft-bow”, Latv. kam̃ps “a bow of a basket” are most likely derived from the verb Lith. kam̃pti, Latv. kàmpt “seize, catch, grasp” (cf. Lat. capulus and capio and others). Lith. šẽškas, Latv. sȩsks “fitchew” are considered to be derivations with suffix -(s) k- from the verbal root šeš- which lurks in Lith. šešti “to be angry, to cavil, to carp”, šešus “angry, captious, fault-finding, carping”, šãšas “scab; abscess, boil, sore”, Latv. sass “scab; itch etc. ”. In view of OCS gnĕv ъ “anger, malice, wrath”, Russ Ch gnĕv ъ “rotten stuff”, OCS gniti “rot, putrefy” and other evidence in the Indo-European languages it is possible to reconstruct for the root šeš- its primary meaning “to rot, to putrefy, to become dirty, putrid, to stink”. To denominate a fitchew after its stench is a well-known fenomenon in the Indo-European languages (cf. e. g. the etymologies of ORuss dъchоrъ, OHG wisula, OFr voison and to some extent E fitchew). The same root šeš- “to rot, to putrefy, to become dirty, putrid, to stink” could be reflected in such Lithuanian and Latvian river names as Šešùpė, Šešuvà, Sesava and others...|$|E

40|$|Non-destructive {{testing of}} welded metal {{components}} {{is an area}} where significant cost savings can be made if preparation costs can be minimised.

40|$|A new clasp to fix small saddle {{prostheses}} {{was designed}} {{to improve the quality}} of prosthetic unilateral free-end saddle restoration. Unlike the known ones, the clasp can be adapted for clinical crowns of any height (particularly useful for low crowns) as no standard elements are required to be fixed on prosthesis. Prosthesis retention is independent of the height of coronal part and the evidence of its survey line. Gentle preparation of abutment teeth allows <b>grinding</b> <b>off</b> hard tooth issues minimally. The combination of fixing elements of a single clasp provides sufficient fixation to achieve high masticatory efficiency and prosthesis spatial stabilization but at the same time only partially limits its lability in mastication.

50|$|Even before NASA did {{flight testing}} on winglets, Burt Rutan {{incorporated}} {{them in his}} innovative Rutan VariEze homebuilt aircraft design, which made its first flight with winglets on May 21, 1975. The VariEze pioneered glass-reinforced plastic composite construction in homebuilt aircraft, which simplified fabrication of the winglets. He reduced the resulting drag penalty by assigning double duty to the winglets; they also serve as vertical stabilizers and rudders in his canard, pusher configuration aircraft. They were also used similarly on the derivative Rutan Long-EZ and reappeared on his Beechcraft Starship business aircraft design that first flew in 1986. Conventional winglets were fitted to Rutan's Rutan Voyager, the first aircraft to circumnavigate the world without refueling in 1986. The aircraft's wingtips were damaged, however, when they dragged along the runway during takeoff, <b>grinding</b> <b>off</b> about 1 ft of each wingtip, so the flight was made without benefit of winglets.|$|R

50|$|In particular, he {{conducted}} detailed anatomical {{studies of the}} cranium of Eusthenopteron foordi using a serial-section technique introduced by William Johnson Sollas and applied to fossil fishes by Erik Stensiö. A fossil of limited external quality was sectioned by <b>grinding</b> <b>off</b> a thin section, photographing the grind-off end and repeat the process until the whole fossil was worked through. The internal structures would then show up on long series of photographs. Working in the day before computer simulations, models was made by projecting reversal film on a board, and cut thin wax plates to match. The sticky wax plates could then be assembled to a three-dimensional scaled-up model of the skull, complete with internal structures such as nerve channels and other internal hollows rarely seen in fossils. Further section to the cranium could easily be made by cutting the wax model at the desired angle. Due to the sticky nature of the wax used, a sectioned skull was put back together by simply pressing the two sections back together. This technique was also applied to the cranium of the porolepiform Glyptolepis groenlandica.|$|R

40|$|THE {{observation}} of certain irregularities in the exposed bifurcation of the l lower first molars {{has led to}} an investigation of these features. A study of the bifurcation of 328 extracted lower molars, divided into 3 groups, was undertaken. In 107 of these teeth (Group 1), buccolingual specimens were prepared by <b>grinding</b> <b>off</b> the mesial half of the tooth, preserving the distal half up to the height of the bifurcation. In 112 other of these teeth (Group 2), the distal half of the tooth was sacrificed, preserving the mesial half of the tooth up to the height of the bifurcation. In 109 teeth (Group 3), both roots were amputated at right angles at a line about 2 mm. from the height of the bifurcation. All these specimens were studied under a dissecting microscope (x 18). Buccolingual ground sections ground {{at the height of the}} bifurcation were then prepared of 35 molars from Group 3. An additional 20 teeth from Group 3 were decalcified and embedded in celloidin. Ten of them were sectioned serially in a buccolingual direction through the bifurcation, the other 10 were sectioned serially in mesiodistal direction. All decalcified sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Every effort was made to observe, as closely as possible, a correct buccolingual plane in cutting and sectioning of gross speci-mens, ground sections, and serial decalcified sections, in order to avoid possible tangential views of the roots. RESULTS The most striking feature found in a majority of specimens was the presence of a distinct ridge, running across the bifurcation in a mesiodistal direction. We called this the intermediate bifurcational ridge (Figs. 1 - 4, 6 - 11). This ridge, where present, originates on the mesial surface of the distal root about 2 mm. from the height of the bifurcation, runs across the bifurcation, and ends high up on the mesial root, there blending into the concavity characteristic for the distal surface of the mesial root of this tooth (Fig. 4). This intermediate ridge was found pronounced (Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 6) in 44 pe...|$|R
