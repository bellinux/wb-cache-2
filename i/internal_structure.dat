5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the <b>internal</b> <b>structure</b> of words are called morphology. The rules of the <b>internal</b> <b>structure</b> of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by the {{developments}} of biomimetic design and layer manufacturing, {{we present a}} microstructure design method which uses complex <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> to achieve an optimal design. Similar to 2 D texture mapping, our approach is based on mapping a 3 D microstructure into a design space to generate <b>internal</b> <b>structures.</b> We develop a texture mapping design system which enables a designer to select a microstructure from a library. Accordingly the system automatically generates a CAD model of <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> based on given design requirements. The system then combines <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> with a given CAD model. The combined CAD model can be fabricated using a layer manufacturing system. The ability to design microstructures within a part creates tremendous potential for lightweight and high performance components and devices...|$|R
40|$|As fine {{templates}} {{to prepare}} microcapsules, multiple emulsions with complex <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> have been generated through microfluidics. To study effects of layers, inner droplets and asymmetry of <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> on rheology of multiple emulsions, a generalized boundary integral method is developed to investigate multiple emulsions with orderly structures up to n layers {{and up to}} mi droplets in the i-th layer. Under a modest extensional flow, the complication of <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> and the collision among inner droplets will subject the particle to stronger shears. However, the particle will ease the added tension through the simplification of <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> (destabilization) such as coalescence or release of inner droplets. Since the rheology of multiple emulsions is sensitive to <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> and their change, modelling them as the core-shell droplets to obtain viscosity equation should be modified by introducing the variable "time". Asymmetric <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> will induce oriented contact and merging of the outer and inner interface. The start time of the interface merging can be controlled by adjusting the viscosity ratio and enhancing the asymmetry, which is promising in the controlled release of inner droplets for targeted drug delivery.

5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same <b>internal</b> <b>structure.</b> There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> inside {{atmospheric}} dust particles, making them inherently inhomogeneous. Such structures may have a large effect on ground-level and atmospheric radiation. So far, dust particle <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> and their effect on the light scattering properties {{have proved to be}} hard to quantify, in part due to challenges in obtaining information about these <b>structures.</b> Recently, <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> of individual dust particles were revealed through focused ion beam milling and analyzed. Here, we perform a sensitivity study to evaluate the optical impacts of some of the typical <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> revealed. To obtain suitable model particles, {{the first step is to}} generate inhomogeneous particles with varying <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> by using an algorithm that is based on three-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. The parameters for the particle generation are obtained from studies of real-world Asian dust particles. The second step is to generate homogeneous versions of the generated particles by using an effective-medium approximation, for comparison. Third, light scattering by both versions of these particles is simulated with discrete dipole approximation code. This allows us to see how different <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> affect light scattering, and how important it is to account for these structures explicitly. Further, this allows us to estimate the potential inaccuracies caused by using only homogeneous model particles for atmospheric studies and remote-sensing measurements. The results show that the effects vary greatly between different kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> and single-scattering quantity considered, but for most structure types the effects are overall notable. Most significantly, hematite inclusions in particles impact light scattering heavily. Furthermore, internal pores and hematite-rich coating both affect some form of light scattering noticeably. Based on this work, it seems that it is exceedingly important that the effects of dust particle <b>internal</b> <b>structures</b> on light scattering are accounted for in a wide variety of applications...|$|R

5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions.

The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs.

Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
