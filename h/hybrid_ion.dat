40|$|The {{aim of the}} helicon plasma generator-assisted {{negative}} {{ion source}} development at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is to use high-density helicon plasmas for producing intense beams of H- ions. Our work consists of two development paths, construction of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>ion</b> source (long-term goal) and replacement of the LANSCE surface converter ion source filaments by a helicon plasma generator (short-term goal). The <b>hybrid</b> <b>ion</b> source {{is a combination of}} a long-life plasma cathode, sustained by a helicon plasma generator, with a stationary, pulsed main discharge (multi-cusp H- production chamber) directly coupled to each other. The electrons are transferred from the helicon plasma to the cusp-chamber by thermal flow process to ignite and sustain the main discharge. Replacing the filaments of the ion source based on surface conversion process by a helicon plasma generator is a low-cost solution, building upon the well-proven converter-type ion sources. Both development paths are aimed at meeting the beam production goals of the LANSCE 800 MeV linear accelerator refurbishment project.
