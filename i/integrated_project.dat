According to the project fact sheet, their mission is “to establish effective routes to foster the adoption of grid computing across the EU and to stimulate research into innovative business models using Grid technologies”. To extract best practice and common themes from the experimental implementations, two groups of consultants are analyzing a series of pilots, one technical, one business.

30|$|We {{sought to}} examine changes in the pedagogical beliefs of {{instructors}} {{participating in a}} national curriculum development program that featured many {{of the elements of}} effective professional development discussed above. This study focuses on the degree to which participation in creating resources for the Interdisciplinary Teaching about the Earth for a Sustainable Future (<b>InTeGrate)</b> <b>project</b> ([URL] contributed to changes in the way instructors thought about and described their teaching. The <b>InTeGrate</b> <b>project</b> is a multi-disciplinary effort to promote geoscience literacy in the context of societal issues, and to increase the numbers of geoscience-related undergraduate majors. While the overall <b>InTeGrate</b> <b>project</b> is multi-faceted, this study focuses on college faculty involved {{in the development of a}} series of introductory geoscience modules. Each module was designed around a topic by teams of three geoscience faculty from a variety of institution types. The curriculum development aspects of the <b>InTeGrate</b> <b>project</b> were designed around the theory of participatory design where participants are a central component of the development process (Mao et al. 2005; Schuler and Namioka 1993). While certain aspects of the <b>InTeGrate</b> <b>project</b> mirror formal professional development (e.g., workshops for participants), other aspects more closely resemble those of informal professional development. For example, participants are required to pilot developed materials in their own classrooms. Additionally, participants spent a significant amount of time discussing pedagogy and instructional strategies with peers within their development teams. InTeGrate material development lasted approximately four semesters (sufficient duration) which included the design of original materials, pilot testing of those materials in classes, and subsequent modifications based on participant’s reflections and feedback from other team members and trained observers. Authors worked as a development team (collaborative) but also interacted with a larger project team that included material reviewers, classroom observers, assessment experts, and leadership and evaluation personnel. Activities designed by the teams were rooted in their own experiences and applicable to students in the courses they taught (authentic). Finally, module authors were provided multiple opportunities (e.g., workshops, webinars, technical reviews) to formally and informally place their work in context of discipline-based education research (Singer et al. 2012) and reflect on their experiences under the guidance of an extensive multi-part materials development rubric and expert reviews (rigorous). Workshops, webinars, and technical reviews were conducted under the direction and guidance of the project’s leadership and covered a variety of topics such as how to design measurable learning objectives, metacognition, and creating student-centered classroom activities.|$|R
