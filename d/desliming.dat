50|$|Wolframite and {{cassiterite}} {{are heavy}} minerals, making them very suitable for recovery by gravity separation. The gravity separation {{process at the}} Drakelands processing plant starts two steps of <b>desliming</b> using Multotec deslime cyclones, designed to cut at 63 and 45 micron respectively. The underflow from these spirals goes to 3 banks of 11 3-start MG6.3 Mineral Technologies spirals (99 spirals in total), producing a rougher concentrate that reports to the cleaner spirals, a middlings product that goes to a bank of 33 middlings spirals and tailings that go to the 25m diameter thickener. The middlings spirals (also MG6.3) tailings go to the thickener, and the concentrate {{is sent to the}} cleaner spirals. The cleaner spirals (4x MG6.3) tailings are recycled to the rougher spirals and the concentrate is sent to Holmans tables for further refining.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of slimes is {{harmful to the}} flotation process: the performance and consumption of reagents are negatively affected. Traditionally, the <b>desliming</b> stage {{has been responsible for}} removing slimes. However, depending on the porosity of the mineral particles, <b>desliming</b> may not be sufficient to maximize the concentration results. An attrition process before the <b>desliming</b> operation can improve the removal of slime, especially when slimes cover the surface and/or are confined to the cavities/pores of the mineral particles. Attrition is present in the flowcharts of the beneficiation process of phosphate and industrial sand (silica sand). Research has been undertaken for its application to produce pre-concentrates of zircon and iron ore. However, there is still little knowledge of the influence of the attrition variables on the beneficiation process of iron ore. This study presents a factorial design and analysis of the effects of these variables on the reverse flotation of iron ore. The standard of the experimental procedures for all tests included the attrition of pulp, under the conditions of dispersion, <b>desliming</b> and flotation. The parameter analysed (variable response) was the metallurgical recovery in reverse flotation tests. The planning and analysis of the full factorial experiment indicated that with 95 % reliability, the rotation speed of the attrition cell impeller was the main variable in the attrition process of the iron ore. The percentage of solid variables in the pulp and the time of the attrition, as well as their interactions, were not indicated to be significant...|$|E
50|$|Mucilage removal {{has been}} done through a fermenting process, which takes between 14 and 18 hours, until the {{mucilage}} is degraded and can easily be removed with water. Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0 L/kg of DPC. Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called <b>Deslim</b> (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7 L/kg of DPC. The resulting highly concentrated mixture of water, mucilage and impurities is viscous and {{is added to the}} separated fruit skin in a screw conveyor. In the screw conveyor the retention is greater than 60%, which means a 20% additional control of potential contamination.|$|R
40|$|Low pulp {{density and}} low grade {{slurries}} {{in the coal}} and minerals industry are discharged as waste to tailings dams, with significant losses of valuable particles. This paper investigates two-stage processing of low pulp density coal slurry using two Reflux Flotation Cells. The Reflux Flotation Cell incorporates a novel arrangement of inclined channels to enhance bubble segregation, enabling significantly higher gas and liquid fluxes. Hence, in the first stage, fast flotation is employed to rapidly recover fine coal using feed fluxes up to {{an order of magnitude}} higher than typical of conventional flotation systems. First stage product is then <b>deslimed</b> in a second stage using fluidization wash water for effective counter-current washing, to produce a low ash coal product.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out on six {{different}} ore types from the Salitre Alkaline Complex aiming to determine their mineralogical composition and the major features that are relevant in the mineral processing. The P(2) O(5) grades vary from 9 to 25 %. The slime content (- 0, 020 mm) varies between 20 and 34 % (w/w) and carries 17 - 22 % of the P(2) O(5) content. The samples essentially consist of apatite, iron oxi-hydroxides, ilmenite, clay minerals, carbonate, quartz, pyroxene, perovskite, secondary phosphates and other minor accessory minerals. Below 0. 21 mm, apatite essentially occurs in free particles showing a clean surface or a weak coating of it-on oxi-hydroxides; the highly covered apatite (not recoverable by flotation) varies from 6 to 9 %. In the <b>deslimed</b> fraction (above 0. 020 mm) more than 97 % of the total phosphor content occurs as apatite; the estimated P 2 0 5 potential recovery in flotation concentration is over 90 % (71 - 76 % overall recovery) ...|$|R

Minerals coming from Sijes, Salta Province, Argentina, mainly identified as colemanite and hydroboracite, with 50. 84 % and 50. 54 % B 2 O 3 respectively, are potentially interesting from an industrial point of view. The <b>desliming</b> purification technique in hydrocyclones used to upgrade B 2 O 3 and downgrade undesirable impurities to the borate market (Rietveld method) mainly iron oxides, chlorides and sulphates) not only eliminates slimes but it also generates pores, through a decrease of the specific surface of the particles. Two samples under different purification steps were analyzed: deslimed and without <b>desliming.</b> The chemical and mineralogical analyses of both samples indicate a decreasing percentage of colemanite, smectite and illite in the deslimed sample with a small increase of hibroracite. The parameters of surface electric charge (PZC and IEP) match the observations made with the electronic microscopy, reveal mineral associations only in the sample without <b>desliming...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper applies Drift Flux {{theory for}} the first time to explore the {{relationship}} between the liquid and solids flow through fluidized beds in the context of <b>desliming</b> of dense minerals. At low solids fluxes the process is not flux curve constrained. Here continuity considerations indicate the net liquid flux through the lower bed is upwards, ideal for the removal of slimes from the underflow product. Moreover, the liquid split to the underflow is also lower, further reducing the slimes content of the underflow. At higher solids fluxes the net liquid flux becomes downwards and eventually the system becomes flux curve constrained. Under these circumstances slimes entrainment to the underflow increases significantly. In order to operate at these higher solids fluxes, and achieve efficient <b>desliming,</b> Split Fluidization should be used. Here additional fluidization liquid is added at a higher elevation, producing a net liquid flux in the upwards direction through the zone above the Split Fluidization entrance level. <b>Desliming</b> experiments covering a range of solids fluxes were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing solids flux and Split Fluidization. This study shows that a system of parallel inclined channels, a key feature of the Reflux Classifier, permits the introduction of this additional liquid while preventing the ultra fine product from being entrained to the overflow reject stream, thus permitting the efficient removal of slimes. Experiments were conducted using an iron ore feed with particles smaller than 0. 50 mm in diameter. Efficient <b>desliming</b> at a relatively high solids feed flux of 20 t/m²h was achieved, but to efficiently deslime at 40 t/m²h significant Split Fluidization was found to be essential...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of {{publications}} concerned with a novel system that transforms the hydrodynamics of flotation. This system, referred to as a Reflux Flotation Cell, consists of a vertical flotation zone, with a system of parallel inclined channels below. The system is enclosed at the top by a fluidization distributor, while a central port is used to discharge the overflow product. The inclined channels located below the vertical section enhance the segregation of the bubbles from the tailings flow, permitting separations to be conducted at bubble surface fluxes well beyond the normal flooding condition, while also permitting extreme wash water fluxes. The system hydrodynamics produces spherical bubbly-foam, with a bubble volume fraction of order 0. 5, ideal for counter-current washing, and hence <b>desliming.</b> This paper addresses two objectives. The first concerns the fluidization boundary condition at the top of the device. We identify for the first time a conundrum that arises when Drift Flux theory and fluidization theory are used to describe the effect of wash water addition in flotation. A subtle but nevertheless significant change in the predicted bias flux arises when the system is formally fluidized, resulting in the wash water reporting with the overflow, and hence failing to provide the desired <b>desliming.</b> Our experimental work, however, demonstrated that the applied fluidization leads to strong positive bias, with a downwards liquid flux and in turn powerful <b>desliming</b> of hydrophilic particles. Indeed the system behaved as though the wash water was introduced below rather than at the upper boundary. The second, and most important objective was to assess the system hydrodynamics with respect to extreme gas and wash water fluxes using firstly a particle-free system, and secondly assess the <b>desliming</b> achievable using a system containing hydrophilic particles. Thus in Part I the system was free of hydrophobic particles. The enhanced bubble–liquid segregation arising from the system of inclined channels permitted very high gas fluxes, sufficient to achieve a bubble surface flux of 144 m 2 /m 2 s, well beyond the theoretical flooding limit of ~ 100 m 2 /m 2 s (Wace et al., 1968). This high bubble surface flux was especially significant given this occurred during the application of extreme bias fluxes, as high as 2. 5 cm/s passing downwards. Experiments involving a silica feed were used to quantify the performance of the <b>desliming,</b> covering extreme gas and fluidization (wash) water fluxes. Silica rejection from the product exceeded 99 %...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{spate of}} catastrophic fill {{barricade}} failures in underground hydraulic fill mines in Australia and overseas, {{have resulted in}} significant economic loss and loss of life. The term 'hydraulic fill' refers to the coarser fraction of a <b>deslimed</b> mine tailings slurry, which is placed in underground voids to improve mine efficiency and operation. A substantial body of research and consulting work has been conducted at the School of Engineering, James Cook University, on studying the drainage characteristics of several different hydraulic fills and barricade bricks from various Australian mines. A new permeability cell was developed for measuring permeability and drainage characteristics of barricade bricks in the laboratory, and JCU has developed and modified laboratory test procedures to assess the permeability of the various hydraulic fills under in-situ conditions. This paper describes some simple techniques used to quantify the flow characteristics of hydraulic fill and barricade bricks in simulated underground conditions. Several findings from this testing, pertinent to the current direction of the Australian mining industry are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Low pulp {{density and}} low grade {{slurries}} {{in the coal}} and minerals industries are discharged as waste to tailings dams, incurring significant losses of valuable particles. This paper investigates the rapid processing and cleaning of hydrocyclone overflow coal slurry using two laboratory scale Reflux Flotation Cells in series {{as a means to}} economically beneficiate low quality tailings streams. The Reflux Flotation Cell incorporates a novel arrangement of inclined channels to enhance bubble-liquid segregation, enabling extremely high gas rates and liquid rates per unit of vessel area. Hence, in the first stage, fast flotation is employed to rapidly recover fine coal particles using a feed flux of 11. 4 ± 0. 5 cm/s, up to an order of magnitude increase in the throughput rate over conventional flotation systems. First stage product was then sent to a second stage for counter-current washing using fluidisation wash water to produce a fully <b>deslimed</b> product, having ash percent in agreement with the minimum ash attainable using flotation as determined through tree flotation analysis. The results demonstrate the potential for two-stage Reflux Flotation to deliver high throughput at a high separation efficiency from low quality slurry, with a fivefold reduction in the required vessel footprint, thus overcoming the principal economic deterrent of having to install banks of large-scale flotation cells...|$|R

40|$|Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia. When the ore is removed from the ground voids are backfilled. Hydraulic backfill and paste fill are most common backfills. These backfills provide safe working conditions and increase the strength of the ground. Hydraulic backfills consist of classified mine tailings with not more than 10 % by weight of size less than 10 μm and approximately 70 % by solid weight. These are prepared on the surface by dewatering the mine tailings and transported to the stope transported by gravity through boreholes and pipelines. The solid particles of hydraulic fills settle rapidly after entering the stopes. Excess water initially tends to pond on the surface building up from the lowest corners of a stope and then commences a vertical path of drainage due to gravity. Several miners and equipment had been trapped in mines due to barricade failures and the resulting in rush of mine fills into the drives. An extensive study of drainage and settlement characteristics of hydraulic fills is required to improve design of drainage and barricades. Most permeability measurements reported in the literature are from undisturbed or reconstituted samples in the laboratory under no surcharge. However, in the mine stopes the hydraulic fill is subjected to significant surcharge due to the overburden. In this research, extensive laboratory tests have been performed to measure permeability of hydraulic fill samples subjected to vertical stress. An analytical solution has been developed to estimate vertical stress development in a vertical and inclined mine stope using continuous compression arch of principal stresses. It has been verified with different analytical model discussed in literature. Degree of saturation of hydraulic fills within mine stopes decreases with continuous drainage of water through barricades. Laboratory tests have been performed to study the moisture content variation in a mine stope with depth and time. Soil-water characteristic curves have been developed using Filter Paper Method for hydraulic fills. Permeability of hydraulic fill has been computed using vertical stress and moisture content variation in a stope. It has been shown graphically. The anecdotal evidence suggests that the consolidation of the <b>deslimed</b> hydraulic fill is instantaneous. In this dissertation, laboratory tests have been conducted using conventional oedometer and modified triaxial cell to measure the settlement of hydraulic fills. It has been found that the immediate settlement and time dependent settlement contributes equally to the total settlement. Pore water pressure dissipation has observed using modified triaxial cell. Time of consolidation and coefficient of consolidation have been estimated and reported. Settlement- effective stress- time plot has been used to investigate the variation of coefficient of secondary compression (Cα) and it has been observed that Cα of hydraulic fill increases with effective stresses and is independent of time. Concept of equivalent permeability has been used to estimate drainage and maximum pore water pressure in a stope using method of fragments. Empirical equation has been proposed to estimate water level in stope at any time after filling. Reliability analysis has been carried out using First Order-Second Moment Analysis Method to measure the effect of parameter and modeling errors in drainage and settlement analysis.

In the iron ore industry, reverse quartz flotation has been successfully employed for particle sizes below ISOfim after the <b>desliming</b> process. The high demand for iron ore products has made flotation the main process for concentration in this industry, thus a better understanding of its mechanisms and the effect of the particle sizes in the process has become imperative.

40|$|The Reflux Flotation Cell (RFC) {{consists}} of an inverted fluidized bubbly bed, located above a system of parallel inclined channels. This novel arrangement enhances the hydrodynamics of flotation {{in a number of}} ways. Firstly, the free-surface of the flotation cell is enclosed via a fluidized bed distributor, ensuring uniform application of wash water to promote <b>desliming.</b> Secondly, foams can be variable in their stability and lack permeability. Hence this system is preferably operated in the absence of foam, instead opting for a bubbly zone of high bubble volume fraction {{through the use of a}} very high gas flux and/or wash water flux. Discharge of the product proceeds upwards through a central port of narrow cross-sectional area. Thirdly, the system of inclined channels increases the segregation between the bubbles and the water, ensuring the bubbly zone remains contained within the upper vertical zone, and the liquid flux reporting to the overflow is low. The expanded operating regime of the RFC was investigated by covering a very broad range of gas fluxes, up to 5. 5 cm/s, and wash water fluxes, over 2 cm/s. Both laboratory and pilot plant performances were quantified by the recovery of hydrophobic particles and rejection of the hydrophilic particles, using model and industrial coal feeds. The new system hydrodynamics was found to offer significant advantages in flotation kinetics, <b>desliming,</b> and particle recovery across a broad particle size range. Bubble interfacial flux reached as high as 600 m 2 /m- 2 s- 1. The upper system consists entirely of a high volume fraction of bubbles, which provides a “safety-net” to protect against the detachment of coarse particles, and a highly permeable zone for counter-current washing of the flotation product.

By using the enzyme preparations Vinozym Process, the speed of <b>desliming</b> was threefold faster, {{and in the case}} of Trenolin Mash and Rohavin LX twofold faster compared to the control sample. These enzyme treatments resulted in clarified the white grape juice, degraded the grape mash, reduced juice viscosity and elicited an improvement in the visual aspect of the wine...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{research on the}} flocculation of various minerals with insoluble cross-linked starch xanthate (ISX) to determine its potential as a beneficiation technique for low-grade, highly dissem-inated ores and for selective <b>desliming.</b> Covellite, chalcocite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, bornite, sphalerite, galena, and molybdenite fines flocculate with ISX. Floc formation, floc size, and settling rate are dependent on pH, with the pH dependence differing for each mineral. Quartz is not flocculated by ISX. Experiments to obtain selective flocculation of sulfides from quartz were attempted. Good selectivity was only obtained for the bornite-quartz system. postflocculation separations resulted in flocculated bornite in grades as high as 92 pet. Evidence is presented that the flocculation {{of many of the}} sulfide minerals with ISX may involve covalent bonding of the xanthate group to lattice metal site(s) ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrocyclones are devices {{worldwide}} used in {{mineral processing}} for <b>desliming,</b> classification, selective classification, thickening and pre-concentration. A hydrocyclone is composed by one cylindrical and one conical section joint together, without any moving parts {{and it is}} capable of perform granular material separation in pulp. The mineral particles separation mechanism acting in a hydrocyclone is complex and its mathematical modelling is usually empirical. The most used model for hydrocyclone corrected cut size is proposed by Plitt. Over the years many revisions and corrections to Plitt´s model were proposed. The present paper shows a modification in the Plitt´s model constant, obtained by exponential regression of simulated data for three different hydrocyclones geometry: Rietema, Bradley and Krebs. To validate the proposed model literature data obtained from phosphate ore using fifteen different hydrocyclones geometry are used. The proposed model shows a correlation equals to 88. 2...|$|E
