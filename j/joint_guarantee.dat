40|$|Reconfigurable or {{flexible}} fixtures, {{an important}} element in automotive body-welding assembly lines, can be designed as mechanisms with lockable joints. This paper proposes a new flexible fixture using stepless lockable joints allowing infinitely many configurations, and hence a broad application range and potential. Several conceptual designs of the key component, the lockable joint, are presented. Unlike existing mechanisms, which can lock the joint in a finite number of positions, the proposed solution is a stepless device. Once locked, the joint can resist high torque in both directions. These characteristics of the lockable <b>joint</b> <b>guarantee</b> the performance of the reconfigurable fixture that employs it. The load testing has been performed on the prototype of a revolute joint that can sustain 800 Nm, and the stiffness of a lockable arm which employs two lockable joints is detected...|$|E

40|$|It is the {{contention}} of this thesis that the Tripartite Alliance {{came at the}} end of a period during which Britain and Turkey attempted to reconcile their often conflicting interests in order to ensure common security in the Near East. Between 1934 - 1939, contrary to the usual belief, the dynamics of Anglo-Turkish relations most often led Turkey to seek a formal relationship, which Britain, for reasons of its own, was reluctant to grant. Once conceded, in May 1939, with the proclamation of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Guarantee,</b> the fledgling Anglo-Turkish condominium promptly began to sicken, and by June 1940, had failed altogether. The primary reasons for this collapse were four. Firstly, the political under-pinnings of the alliance never seemed sufficient to permit either partner to consider advantageous the activation of the alliance once made. Secondly, the Alliance was afflicted by certain powerful dilemmas within Britain's global strategy which prevented British planners from coming to any lasting consensus regarding Turkey's role in imperial defence. Thirdly, if the alliance were to be made effective, sufficient and timely assistance [...] chiefly, material and economic assistance [...] would have to be provided the Turkish partner. During this early period, both Britain and France remained unable or unwilling to provide anything like the level of assistance required. Finally, the numerous inter-allied Staff conversations, which were a principle feature of the Alliance's early years, failed to produce a single viable option for the fruitful deployment of common forces against any possible enemy. Without such a plan, the entry of Turkey to the war would have been worse than ill-advised; it would have been pointless. Once the Alliance had definitely foundered on these rocks, in the infinitely more menacing conditions existing after June 1940, it was entirely unlikely that Turkey would permit the activation of an alliance no longer consistent, by any reading, with its essential interests.

40|$|This paper {{elucidates}} {{the plans}} for Korea's neutralization by Russia between 1900 - 1903 and evaluates its connection with Count Witte's Manchurian policy It deals {{with a series of}} three attempts to realize Korea's neutrality under the auspices of a "joint guarantee by the Powers," which was invented by the Russian government. In most of the literature reviewed, discussions about Russia's Korean neutralization plans have failed to view them as policies initiated by the government as a whole, and tended to interpret them only as impromptu, unauthoritative proposals by Russian Ministers on the spot. Witte, as the Russian Minister of Finance who had the greatest influence in Russian East Asian affairs, sought to strike separate under-the-table deals with Japan concerning Korea's neutrality. Japan in fact wanted a free hand for itself in the Korean peninsula, however, which seemed to Russia absolutely unacceptable in view of Korea's paramount strategic significance. This study shows that Korea's neutralization was Russia's ultimate goal, and this goal conflicted with lapan's stance on the Korean and Manchurian issues. In the end, these tensions contributed to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The Korean neutralization policy was originated and conducted by Witte. This was due to Witte and his ministry's involvement in all aspects of Russian foreign affairs. Witte's solution to the Korean problem was always connected with the situation in Manchuria, where the Russians wanted to exercise their extraterritorial rights. He brought up the Korean neutralization policy as a temporary means to defend against the lapanese from "getting into Korea" while Russian troops were actively engaged against the Boxer Rebellion in Manchuria. Witte argued that Japan would be handicapped by the expenditures it was making in Korea {{and that it would be}} much more susceptible to Russian pressure, especially once the Transsiberian Railroad was completed. All of which would make it easier for Russia to take possession of Korea later, if circumstances required. In other words, Witte was simply searching for a modus vivendi until Russian preparations were complete. Henceforth Russian troops occupied Manchuria on 7 January 1901, Izvolskii, the Russian Minister to Japan, proposed Korea's neutralization under international guarantees, that is, by Japan and Russia, which in substance would divide the Korean peninsula according to each side's sphere of influence. The Japanese government, however, replied that they would not discuss Korea's neutrality until the Russians took steps to move their armies out of Manchuria. By replying through Chinda, the Japanese Minister to St. Petersburg, Japan by- passed lzvolskii who had been entrusted by the Czar with the authority to negotiate the neutralization issue. The two countries' relations continued to be very strained. The "war crisis" of Spring 1901, caused by the conflict and mutual distrust between Russia and lapan on the Manchurian and Korean questions, had a number of consequences. First, it tended to unite Japanese statesmen who had previously been undecided with the proponents of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Second, for Witte, Russia's primary concern was to avoid war with Japan, and the best means for solving the Manchurian problem was to renounce any political intentions in Manchuria and limit Russian interests there to the protection the Chinese Eastern Railway's interest as a private company With regards to Korea, he felt that if lapan demanded the country's annexation, the proper course would be to open the issue to international discussion. Even if Japan seized Korea, Russia should not consider it a casus belli. Following the "war crisis," a second neutrality scheme was attempted by Witte himself. In July 1901, when his ideas were accepted as the basis for a plan for the three-stepped e vacuation of Manchuria with some reservations, he approached the Japanese Minister in St. Petersburg and suggested, unofficially, a conditional arrangement regarding the crucial Korean problem. Russia, he said, would agree to a settlement making Korea a neutral area, but allow Japan the right to supply the Korean government with administrative and fmancial advisers as well as with a chief of police. In return, Iapan would officially recognize Russia's preponderance in Manchuria. Witte's practical proposals would have conceded Japan's demands in Korea with some reservations and normalized relations with China. The main concern of Wiitte's counterpart, however, was Korea, and for Japan it was seen as matter of life and death for Japan to keep Russia out of Korea. Japan could not question the actions of Russia in Manchuria merely on the basis of the London Times revelations of reported Russo-Chinese secret ne gotiations to consolidate Russia's occupation of Manchuria. By tying in the Manchurian question with Korea they hoped to ascertain Russia's intentions. The Russian proposal ended in failure because lapan would not enter into an agreement concerning Korea until the fate of Manchuria was decisively settled. Russia did not take this to mean a breakdown in negotiations. In Decernber 1901, while the question of a military retreat from Manchuria was a heated subject of discussion between Russia and China, Witte suggested more specific neutrality terms in St. Petersburg, in talks with Ito, Iapan's former Premier. It is evident that the Russians accepted the Japanese demands with respect to Korea only with the following qualifications: guarantees to maintain Korea's independence, not to use any part of Korean territory for strategic purposes, and not to hinder Russia's free passage through the Korea Strait. In return, Russia was to be left with a free hand in Manchuria. On the other hand, Ito brought with him an itemized plan setting forth Japan's desire for a free hand in Korea commercially, industrially, militarily and politically, as well as offering a guarantee that the country would not be used for military purposes against Russia. In the end, Russia's final plan was refused by the Japanese government. Japan felt compelled to conclude an alliance with England which would provide it with the guarantees it needed for primacy over Korea rather than negotiate an agreement with Russia which would have hindered it in attaining this goal. The last secret attempt by Russia to achieve Korea's neutrality was the proposal for the "Neutralization of Korea under the <b>joint</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the Three Powers, Russia, Japan, and America. " This plan was aborted almost as soon as Russia had begun proposing it, mainly because America had already made a decision not to interfere in a matter being pursued by the Japanese government. At the time lapan questioned Russia's approaches to America. It is evident that with the first scheduled evacuation in Manchuria coming soon, Witte probably considered the plan as a way of placating America and to encouraging them to develop a new understanding regarding Korea. To restrict Russia's activities in Manchuria and in support of the Anglo-Iapanese Alliance, the United States demanded the 'Open Door' policy in China. It should be also noted that the fmal neutralization scheme proposed in September 1902 was a more concrete version of the plan "under the <b>joint</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the Powers" which had been formally proposed in January 1901. The main feature of the negotiations on Korea's neutralization between Russia and Japan was that the Russian proposals were repeatedly rejected by the Japanese, who were always one step ahead of Russia. The pattern of Russia's abortive schemes for Korean neutrality did not change in official discussions on the Manchurian and Korean questions after August 1903, the period of so-called "w ar diplomacy. " From the Japanese point of view," the neutralization of Korea" meant the sacrifice of its position on the peninsula. In fact, Japan, not yet viewing itself as a fully independent actor, had the support of England and America behind it. Agreeing to anti-Russian common interests, the Western powers did not stint in their promises of diplomatic support to Japan. It can be surmised that the failure of Russia's schemes to neutralize Korea, aimed at putting lapan's imperialistic ambitions to rest, was a by-product of general trends in power politics in East Asia since the last decades of the nineteenth century...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Great attention and time is dedicated to the design phase, digital mock-upping and virtual comparative assessment of different solutions. Mechatronic interdisciplinary design methodology including mechanisms analysis, sensory actuation issues and functional materials characterization, control and communication integration has been adopted. Findings: The locomotion modules are revised and updated versions improving climbing ability of the socked locomotion module originally proposed by the authors. New steering modules with high orientation workspace, based on smart actuation, are introduced. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation of the findings on the field is planned but no experimental result is today available. Practical implications: Agile serpentine robots are requested for quick and safe rescue and special risky interventions in environments where dense vegetation, rubble and confined spaces prevent human presence. These robots offer invaluable potential help in such risky interventions mainly by being agile in exploring the environment, robust, low cost, reliable, and tele-operated.

Stewart {{platform}} is a six {{degree of freedom}} (DOF) parallel manipulatoractuated by six linear actuators. The position and orientation of the moving{{platform is}} controlled by the lengths of the six struts actuated by the linearactuators. Each actuator is connected to the base end by a two DOF universaljoint, and connected to the moving platform by a three DOF spherical joint. Using this kind of closed loop mechanism for designing a six DOF motion systemhas several advantages:(1) without error accumulation of each axis to make itwith higher precision; (2) the load force of each strut is only compressive,so it can bear larger load; and (3) due to its closed loop structure, it hashigher stiffness. In this thesis, we assume that the twelve multi-DOF <b>joints</b> <b>guarantee</b> guiding precision and lack of backlash, and that each strut is actuated by apiezoelectric actuator. The dynamics model of the Stewart platform is firstderived and a composite control strategy consisting of moving platform model-based feedback linearization and simple fuzzy logic control is proposedfor six-DOF micropositioning. By cinsidering the six internal axial forceson the six spherical joints at the moving end as the virtual actuating inputforces of the moving platform, feedback linearization can be easily used toderive the desired acting forces of the six struts to moving the end-effector. The corresponding desired linear displacement of each piezoelectric actuatorcan thus be computed based on the strut model, and then each piezoelectricactuator''s control voltage is generated by its simple SISO fuzzy logic controllaw.

After the negotiation of Swiss neutrality in 1815, Canning's role there became dull to him, but he stayed until 1819, when he was recalled and sent to Washington as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to the United States. Although he hoped for major accomplishments in Washington that would allow him to move up to a larger position, he was largely unsuccessful. The initiative of his cousin George, this time as Foreign Secretary, for a <b>joint</b> Anglo-American <b>guarantee</b> of Latin American independence, led to the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine. In 1820 Canning was made a member of the Privy Council.|$|R
40|$|The term “disintegrated tuberculous hip ” {{refers to}} a {{completely}} disorganised hip joint, in which the acetabulum and {{the head and neck}} of the femur have been destroyed by a tuberculous process-a hip in which conservative treatment offers no possibility of restoration of mobility and little hope of restoration of stability (Figs. I and 2). Experience has shown that only sound bony fusion of these <b>joints</b> <b>guarantees</b> a cure. The operation is done in two stages. The first stage may have to be subdivided into two procedures: drainage of the diseased joint (Girdlestone and Somerville 1952) : and FIG. I FIG. 2 Radiographs showing “disintegrated hips. ” Figure 1 -The pelvis of a boy of ten, showing extensive destruction of the right hip. The disease had been active for four years and an abscess was present. Figure 2 -The pelvis of a youth of nineteen, showing destruction of the right hip. The process {{had been going on for}} eleven years. excision of the joint, shaping the greater trochanter to fit into a reamed acetabulum, and holding the hip widely abducted in plaster until fusion occurs (Abbott and Fischer 1931). The second stage consists in high femoral osteotomy, with ischio-femoral graft (Brittain 1942). MATERIAL Over the past four years fifty-eight patients with disintegrated tuberculous hips have been operated upon without mortality. No radical operation was done in children under six years of age, because the fate of the epiphyses was unknown. The first twenty-five patients, who were operated on between June 1954 and October 1956, have been selected for review because all have been under observation for at least two years (Table I). Twenty-two of the patients were Chinese; the rest were Malayan. No patient had received any treatment in hospital during the first two years of the disease, and two had not even had any domiciliary treatment. The rest were treated intermittently for three to ten years before surgery was undertaken. Eighteen patients came to operation three to ten years from the onset of the disease; one after sixteen years. One patient had had no treatment whatever for fifteen years before operation...|$|R
