40|$|Abstract: Since a few years, {{scenario}} based {{requirements engineering}} approaches have gained in popularity. Textual scenarios are narrative descriptions of flows of actions between agents. They are often proposed to elicit, validate or document requirements. The CREWS experience {{has shown that}} the advantage of scenarios is their easiness of use, and that their disadvantage stands in the lack of <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>authoring.</b> In this article, we propose guidance <b>for</b> the <b>authoring</b> of scenarios. The guided scenario authoring process is divided into two main stages: the writing of scenarios, and the correcting of scenarios. To guide the writing of scenarios, we provide style and contents guidelines referring to a conceptual and a linguistic model of scenarios. To guide the correcting of scenarios, we propose a set of enactable rules. These rules aim at the clarification, completion and conceptualisation of scenarios, and help the scenario author to improve his scenarios until acceptable quality in the terms of the former scenario models. The paper presents both style / contents guidelines, and correction rules, and illustrates them with the London Ambulance Service example...|$|R

40|$|Welcome to {{the latest}} release of the SAE Style Guide. SAE is {{continues}} its initiative to move towards publishing content online, {{and in order to}} do so, the <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>authoring</b> technical papers must be updated. These guidelines will enable content to be stored electronically in a standard format (XML), thereby preserving the content for initial publication as well as for future special publications, journals, and products. All publications, including printed papers, PDF files, and hyperlinked web content will be produced from the XML. In addition to enabling new products, the updated process shifts many formatting tasks from the author to the publisher (SAE), eliminating for example the need <b>for</b> the <b>author</b> to manage whitespace, page breaks, and multiple columns. Migration to the new publishing system will not be accomplished overnight but SAE is committed to improving our processes, procedures and systems. Authors will benefit from the relaxed formatting specifications described in this Style Guide and the companion SAE Technical Paper Template. Both of these documents, along with the process itself, will evolve based on feedback from authors, publishers, and readers of SAE technical papers. We welcome your comments a...|$|R

50|$|EASE <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>Authors</b> and Translators of Scientific Articles to be Published in English (often {{shortened}} to EASE <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>Authors</b> and Translators or EASE Guidelines) {{were first}} {{published by the}} European Association of Science Editors (EASE) in 2010. Updated versions are periodically released at the EASE Guidelines page of the EASE website. EASE Guidelines summarize the most important editorial recommendations, aiming to make international scientific communication more efficient and to aid in preventing scientific misconduct. They also support the global initiative Healthcare Information For All by 2015 by advising authors to make abstracts of their papers highly informative, reliable, and easily understandable. The document has been translated into many languages (Arabic, Bangla, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese), to facilitate its popularization worldwide and help scientists from non-Anglophone countries.|$|E
50|$|Editors {{strive to}} ensure that the {{scientific}} research presented is correct, complete, accessible, retrievable and durable, i.e. to guarantee the physical integrity of the data. There is also a moral aspect to science communication, where editors have possibly a more difficult role to play, monitoring such aspects as conflict of interest, gender bias and guest authorship. The aim of the 2009 EASE Conference was to provide guidance to editors on ways in which they can monitor the physical and moral integrity of scientific communications passing through their hands, what to look out for and where they can turn for further advice. A draft version of the EASE <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>Authors</b> and Translators of Scientific Articles was presented and discussed in Pisa.|$|E

If no COI was reported, the websites of the respective journals {{as well as the}} <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>authors</b> were screened for requirements of COI disclosures {{at the time of the}} publication of the review.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss some {{important}} aspects involved while writing an article to publish in a scientific journal. This is a review article. I argue that writing an article is technical as well as creative art of an author which facilitates acceptance of article for publication in a scientific journal. Academicians are obliged to conduct research and publish articles to demonstrate their job efficiency. To publish an article in a scientific journal is the first necessary condition to meet standard norms i. e. journal's <b>guideline</b> <b>for</b> <b>authors</b> and the next is to follow the editing processes of the journal. Writing an article for printed version is becoming an old fashion. Therefore, authors need to learn how to submit a scholarly written article online and follow review processes. Writing and publishing of a scientific article is not only important for individuals and specific scientific community, it is also important to the wider society which helps to enhance stock of knowledge, and sharing and learning culture.

40|$|Since {{last two}} decades, {{some of the}} major urban policy, {{legislation}} and building regulation changes have been made in Chandigarh, which are having a major impact on the physical and the visual fabric of the city. This paper, which is a pre formative <b>guideline</b> <b>for</b> <b>author’s</b> further research is an attempt to understand these policies and urban regulation changes and how are these going to affect the future growth of the city? Some of the regulations may be required to keep the pace with time while others have been made as part of public demand or few of them may just be for speculative purposes but all of these are going to have some affect on the city character. This paper highlights {{some of the major}} changes in the original master plan of the city which could have some irreversible impact that could {{take a long time to}} restore the concept. It is an initial exploration by author in the field of city regulations. A change in land use or in building regulations is an attempt to make the city lively and growth oriented for citizens, but are these changes really helping or not is another important aspect to be understood...|$|R

A more detailed description on the homeopathic substances, for example, manufacture, dilution method, starting point of dilution is required. A further result of the Delphi process is to raise scientists' awareness of reporting blinding, allocation, replication, quality control and system performance controls. The part “Results” should provide the exact number of treated units per setting which were included in each analysis and state missing samples and drop outs. Results presented in tables and figures are as important as appropriate measures of effect size, uncertainty and probability. “Discussion” in a report should depict more than a general interpretation of results in the context of current evidence but also limitations and an appraisal of aptitude for the chosen experimental model. Authors of homeopathic basic research publications are encouraged to apply our checklist when preparing their manuscripts.

40|$|Principles of {{publishing}} Issues of authorship, duplicate publication and plagiarism in scientific journal papers can cause considerable conflict {{among members of}} research teams and embarrassment <b>for</b> both <b>authors</b> and editors. Accordingly, the British Psychological Society has produced the following set of <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> prospective <b>authors</b> who are also members of the Society. Five core issues are covered by the recommendations on the principles {{of publishing}} outlined below: authorship, duplicate publication, plagiarism, accuracy of reporting, and the role of reviewers. Authorship The overriding principle of the recommendations on authorship is that only those collaborators who have made a significant scientific contribution should be credited as authors. It is not only the writers of the paper who are entitled to authorship. Inclusion is merited if an individual has made a major scientific contribution to the research project as a whole and/or the writing of the paper. Specifically, significant contributions are: Origination and formulation of the research idea and hypothese...|$|R
