5000|$|Before Latvia could {{adopt the}} euro, {{it had to}} meet five {{convergence}} criteria set by the EU. An assessment by the European Central Bank (ECB) in April 2012 found that Latvia met {{three of the five}} criteria. The Latvian Finance Minister announced in December 2012 that since convergence checks were only conducted biennially, an extraordinary report would be requested in February 2013, but in January 2013 Prime Minister Dombrovskis stated that for [...] "technical reasons" [...] the request had been delayed until March. However, he was confident that Latvia was [...] "fulfilling the Maastricht euro adoption criteria with a considerable reserve, therefore I don't see any basis on which this convergence report would be negative." [...] The Latvian government formally applied for a convergence check at the beginning of March, and the resulting convergence report, published on 5 June 2013 by the European Commission, concluded that [...] "the Commission considers that Latvia fulfils the conditions for the adoption of the euro." [...] The ECB simultaneously published a report which noted that [...] "Latvia is within the reference values of the convergence criteria". Latvia's adoption of the euro, a legal obligation now that the convergence criteria have been met, was given final approval by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 9 July, and the lats was replaced with the euro on 1 January 2014. The <b>Euro</b> <b>switchover</b> ceremony took place at a site where Latvia’s crisis began - the former headquarters of the collapsed Parex bank, now headquarters of state-owned Citatele bank, which emerged from Parex’s ruins.|$|E

Our results indicate that the Eurozone inflation rate after the introduction of the euro is on average significantly higher than prior to the changeover. Additionally, we find no evidence of a further significant reduction in price dispersion since the <b>euro</b> <b>switchover</b> in comparison with the previous period during which progress towards a leveling of existing price differentials had been made.
