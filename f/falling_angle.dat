40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} {{is designed to}} the guidance of rocket-propelled missile with multiple object constraints. It allows the rocket-propelled missile to reach its target with a close to zero <b>falling</b> <b>angle</b> at a least time-of-flight (TOF). Instead of deriving the optimum guidance law {{by a series of}} linear quadratic optimization methods which results in guidance laws being complex, the new guidance law adopts a mixed framework composed of a modified PN guidance command and a TOF guidance command. The modified PN guidance is designed based on measured state information including missile position, flight-path angle and acceleration, which yields zero-miss-distance and zero-falling-angle. The TOF guidance command is determined in quadratic multinomial with respect to TOF error that is estimated with missile velocity reduction due to aerodynamic drag. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed guidance law performs favorably in multiple object constraints...|$|E

40|$|Applied Mechanics Reviews, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 62, 010802 The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] Navy’s mine impact burial prediction model creates a time {{history of a}} cylindrical or a noncylindrical mine as it falls through air, water, and sediment. The output of the model is the predicted mine trajectory in air and water columns, burial depth/orientation in sediment, as well as height, area, and volume protruding. Model inputs consist of parameters of environment, mine characteristics, and initial release. This paper reviews near three decades’ effort on model development from one to three dimensions: (1) onedimensional models predict the vertical position of the mine’s center of mass (COM) with the assumption of constant <b>falling</b> <b>angle,</b> (2) two-dimensional models predict the COM position in the x,z plane and the rotation around the y-axis, and (3) three-dimensional models predict the COM position in the x,y,z space and the rotation around the x-, y-, and z-axes. These models are verified using the data collected from mine impact burial experiments. The one-dimensional model only solves one momentum equation (in the z-direction). It cannot predict the mine trajectory and burial depth well. The twodimensional model restricts the mine motion in the x,z plane (which requires motionless for the environmental fluids) and uses incorrect drag coefficients and inaccurate sediment dynamics. The prediction errors are large in the mine trajectory and burial depth prediction (six to ten {{times larger than the}} observed depth in sand bottom of the Monterey Bay). The three-dimensional model predicts the trajectory and burial depth relatively well for cylindrical, near-cylindrical mines, and operational mines such as Manta and Rockan mines...|$|E
30|$|A {{side weir}} is {{installed}} on the side wall of the main channel in order to adjust the flow level. Also, flow within open channel along the side weir is considered as spatially varied flow (SVF) with decreasing discharge. Moreover, many experimental and analytical researches and {{studies have been conducted}} on the flow pattern of these types of structures. There are so many studies on the flow within rectangular channels along the side weir carried out by various researchers. For example, Ackers (1957), Nandesamoorthy and Thomson (1972), Yu-Tech (1972), RangaRaju et al. (1979), Hager (1982), Uyumaz and Smith (1991), Jalili and Borghei (1996), Borghei et al. (1999), Khorchani and Blanpain (2004), Vatankhah and Bijankhan (2009), Emiroglu et al. (2010, 2011), Bagheri and Heidarpour (2012), Novak et al. (2013), Mohammed (2013) studied the hydraulic behavior of the side weir flow. Additionally, various studies were carried out related to trapezoidal channels along the side weir. For instance, Cheong (1991) presented an equation in order to compute the discharge coefficient of side weirs located on trapezoidal conduit. Also, Vatankhah (2012 a) proposed an analytical solution to predict the variations of flow free surface along the side weir for subcritical and supercritical flow regimes. For U-shaped channels along the side weir, Uyumaz (1997) using the specific energy principles and the finite difference method provided an analytical solution for predicting variations of the flow free surface profile along the side weirs. Uyumaz, by conducting some experiments in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions, showed an acceptable agreement between the experimental and mentioned method results. Vatankhah (2013) introduced a semi-analytical solution for predicting variations of the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the side weirs located on U-shaped channels. The method was based on the energy principles obtained by integration solution. Additionally, for triangular channels along the side weirs, Uyumaz (1992) presented an analytical solution for calculating variations of the flow free surface along the side weirs in subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In addition, Vatankhah (2012 b) using integration and the principles of specific energy solved the governing dynamical equation on the passing flow over side weirs located on triangular channels. Vatankhah’s analytical method predicts the free surface flow profile along the side weir with an acceptable accuracy. Moreover, channels with circular cross section are used in urban sewage disposal networks and drainage systems. In association with circular channels along the side weirs, Allen (1957) conducted an experimental study on the hydraulic behavior of the passing flow over rectangular side weirs. Uyumaz and Muslu (1985) by assuming that the flow in the main channel is two dimensional and the pressure is hydrostatical predicted the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the side weir and the passing flow over it using the finite element method. Their analytical method for both supercritical and subcritical flow conditions was validated by experimental results. Ramamurthy et al. (1995) through the two-dimensional flow theory provided an analytical method for predicting the passing flow over a side weir located on a circular channel. They introduced the theoretical discharge coefficient of the side weir {{as a function of the}} geometric parameters of the side weir. Oliveto et al. (2001) investigated the characteristics of supercritical flow conditions along the side weirs located on circular channels. Their experiments have been focused on the local measurement of the flow output angle and the velocity along the side weir. In all experiments, the side weir upstream flow is subcritical and the flow along the side weir is supercritical. Vatankhah (2012 c) by the incomplete elliptic integrals method and the specific energy principle provided a semi-analytical solution for calculating the longitude profile of the flow free surface in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In practice, it is possible that the flow along the side weir be supercritical. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on supercritical flows passing through channels with side weir. Hager (1994) provided an analytical method for supercritical flows passing through circular channels with side weir. His method is used in both flow conditions: with hydraulic jumps and without hydraulic jumps. He validated the obtained results from his analytical method by the experimental results obtained by other researches. Ghodsian (2003) investigated the passing supercritical flow over the side weir located on a rectangular channel. He introduced the elementary discharge coefficient of the side weir in supercritical flow conditions as a function of the ratio of the head above the weir to the weir crest height and the Froude number. Mizumura et al. (2003) provided an analytical solution for calculating the main channel discharge in a rectangular channel with side weir in supercritical flow conditions. Their analytical method was based on the energy principles, and the main channel discharge was introduced as a function of the Froude number. Pathirana et al. (2006) conducted an experimental study including investigation of the upstream specific energy, the discharge coefficient and the passing flow over the side weir in supercritical flow conditions for a rectangular channel equipped with a side weir. Using the specific energy principles and the regression analysis, they provided a relationship for calculating the discharge coefficient of side weirs in supercritical flow conditions. Rao and Pillai (2008) investigated the discharge coefficient of the side weir, the velocity in the main channel, the flow <b>falling</b> <b>angle</b> from the side weir and measured the flow depth along the weir by conducting an experimental study on a rectangular channel with side weir in supercritical flow conditions. Coonrod et al. (2009) investigated the effect of guide vanes on increasing the diversion flow rate over side weirs located on rectangular channels in supercritical flow conditions. In recent years, computational fluids dynamics (CFD) has been introduced as a powerful tool for understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of fluids and the interaction between the fluid and the structure. Also, many studies were carried out in order to simulate the flow field of main channels along the side weir. For example, Qu (2005) modeled three-dimensional (3 D) changes of the flow in rectangular channels along the side weir using the k - ω turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) scheme. Tadayon (2009) developed a numerical model to simulate the flow field within rectangular conduits along the side weir. The numerical model simulated the flow turbulence and variations of the flow free surface with the RSM turbulence model and the VOF method, respectively. Aydin (2012) using the FLUENT software simulated the flow free surface within a rectangular channel along the triangular labyrinth side weir by the VOF scheme. Aydin and Emiroglu (2013) using the ANSYS FLUENT software simulated the discharge capacity of labyrinth side weirs. They modeled the free surface changes by the VOF method and the flow turbulence by different turbulence models. Furthermore, they showed that the discharge coefficient increased by increasing the Froude number. Azimi et al. (2014) simulated the velocity field along the side weir in circular channels using RNG k - ε and VOF scheme. Also, Azimi and Shabanlou (2015) modeled the flow pattern in triangular channels along the side weir. The effect of the Froude number was examined on the characteristics of the flow field.|$|E

40|$|More {{than thirty}} percent of persons over 65 years fall {{at least once a}} year and are often not able to get up again unaided [1][2]. The lack of timely aid can lead to severe {{complications}} such as dehydration, pressure ulcers and death. A camera-based fall detection system can provide a solution. For this, several new algorithms have been proposed in the literature recently [3 - 6]. However, these algorithms are evaluated almost exclusively on data captured in controlled environments, under optimal conditions (simple scenes, perfect illumination and setup of cameras), and with falls simulated by actors. In contrast, we collected a dataset based on real life data, recorded at the place of residence of three older persons over several months. We showed that this poses a significantly harder challenge than the “artificial” datasets used in previous studies. The image quality is typically low. Falls are rare and vary a lot both in speed and nature. We investigated the variation in environment parameters and context during the fall incidents. We found that various complicating factors, such as moving furniture or the use of walking aids, are very common yet almost unaddressed in the literature. Under such circumstances and given the large variability of the data in combination with the limited number of examples available to train the system, we posit that simple yet robust methods incorporating, where available, domain knowledge (e. g. the fact that the background is static or that a fall usually involves a downward motion) seem to be most promising. Based on these observations, we propose a new fall detection system. It is based on background subtraction and simple measures extracted from the dominant foreground object such as aspect ratio, <b>fall</b> <b>angle</b> and head speed. All tests are executed using real life data, which has been recorded at the home of 3 elderly, containing 24 falls. Experiments indicate that a fall detector based on a combination of aspect ratio, head speed and <b>fall</b> <b>angle</b> is preferred.

Different voltage boost circuit configurations are compared.

5000|$|Since {{their first}} {{application}} prior to World War I, bombsights have gone though several major revisions. The earliest systems were iron sights that were pre-set {{to an estimated}} <b>fall</b> <b>angle.</b> In some cases these consisted of {{nothing more than a}} series of nails hammered into a convenient spar, lines drawn on the aircraft, or visual alignments of certain parts of the structure. These were replaced by the earliest custom-designed systems, normally iron sights that could be set based on the aircraft's airspeed and altitude. These early systems were replaced by the vector bombsights, which added the ability to measure and adjust for winds. Vector bombsights were useful for altitudes up to about 3,000 m and speeds up to about 300 km/h. Starting in the 1930s, mechanical computers with the performance needed to [...] "solve" [...] the equations of motion were incorporated into the new tachometric bombsights, the most famous being the Norden. Later in World War II, tachometric bombsights were often combined with radar systems to allow accurate bombing through clouds or at night. When post-war studies demonstrated that bomb accuracy was roughly equal when optically or radar guided, optical bombsights were generally removed and the role passed to dedicated radar bombsights. Finally, especially from the 1960s on, fully computerized bombsights were introduced, which combined the bombing with long-range navigation and mapping.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} {{the implementation of a}} reliable intelligent fall detection system so as to reduce accidental falls among the elderly people. A video-based detection system was used because it preserved privacy while monitoring the activities of the senior citizens. Another advantage of the video-based system is that the senior citizens are able to move freely without experiencing any hassles in wearing them as opposed to portable fall detection sensors so that they can have a more independent and happy life. A scientific research method was employed to improve the existing fall detection systems in terms of reliability and accuracy. This thesis consists of four stages where the first stage reviews the literature on the current fall detection systems, the second stage investigates the various algorithms of these existing fall detection systems, the third stage describes the proposed fall detection algorithm in detecting falls using two distinct approaches. The first approach deals with the use of specific features of the silhouette, an extracted binary map obtained from the subtraction of the foreground from the background, to determine the <b>fall</b> <b>angle</b> (FA), the bounding box (BB) ratio, the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the combination of FA, BB, and HMM. The second approach used is the neural network approach which is incorporated in the algorithm to identify a predetermined set of situations such as praying, sitting, standing, bending, kneeling, and lying down. The fourth stage involves the evalua- tion of the developed video-based fall detection system using different metrics which measure sensitivity (i. e. the capacity of the fall detection system to detect as well as declare a fall) and specificity (i. e. the capacity of the algorithm to detect only falls) of this algorithm. The video camera was properly positioned to avoid any occluding objects and also to cover a certain range of motion of the stunt participants performing the falls. The silhouette is extracted using an approximate median filtering approach and the threshold criteria value of 30 pixels was used. Morphological filtering methods that were dilation and erosion were used to remove any spurious noises from the extracted image prior to subsequent feature analysis. Then, this extracted silhouette was scaled and quantised using 8 bits/pixel and compared to the set of predetermined scenarios using a neural network of perceptrons. This neural network was trained based on various situations and the falls of the participants which represent inputs to the neural network algorithm during the neural learning process. In this research study, the built neural network consisted of 600 inputs, as well as 10 neurons in the hidden layer together with 7 distinct outputs which represent the set of predefined situations. Furthermore, an alarm generation algorithm was included in the fall detection algorithm such that there were three states that were STATE NULL (set at 0), STATE LYING (set at 1) and STATE ALL OTHERS (set at 2) and the initial alarm count was set to 90 frames (meaning 3 seconds of recorded consecutive images at 30 frames per second). Therefore, an alarm was generated only when the in-built counter surpassed this threshold of 90 frames to signal that a fall occurred.
