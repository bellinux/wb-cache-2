On 17 May, a messenger, José Remigio Sarabia, an Indian {{from the town of}} Santiago Nuyoo, managed to get through the blockaded city and get word to General José María Morelos, who was in Chilapa at the time.

50|$|The second Rubin {{maneuver}} {{is performed}} by inserting one hand vaginally behind the posterior aspect of anterior {{shoulder of the}} foetus and rotating the shoulder towards the chest of the foetus, shifting it from the midline (12 <b>o</b> <b>clock)</b> to 11 <b>o</b> <b>clock</b> or 1 <b>o</b> <b>clock</b> position. As a result, the foetal shoulder girdle is adducted and the diameter is reduced. The second Rubin maneuver is more successful if it is combined with suprapubic pressure to facilitate vaginal rotation. This maneuver is painful and difficult for an unanesthetized mother. For primipara, an episiotomy may be performed before inserting the vaginal hand. The reverse Wood's screw maneuver {{is the same as}} second Rubin maneuver except that it is performed on posterior shoulder and the rotation happens on an oblique plane.|$|R
