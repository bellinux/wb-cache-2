25|$|The Divan-ı Hümâyûn, in English the Imperial Council, was the {{de facto}} cabinet of the Ottoman Empire {{for most of its}} history. Initially an {{informal}} gathering of the senior ministers presided over by the Sultan in person, in the mid-15th century the Council's composition and function became firmly regulated. The Grand Vizier, who became the Sultan's deputy as the head of government, assumed the role of chairing the Council, which comprised also the other viziers, charged with military and political affairs, the two kadi'askers or military judges, the defterdars in charge of finances, the nişancı in charge of the palace scribal service, and later the Kapudan Pasha, the head of the Ottoman Navy, and occasionally the beylerbey of Rumelia and the Agha of the Janissaries. The Council met in a dedicated building in the Second Courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, initially daily, then for four days a week by the 16th century. Its remit encompassed all matters of governance of the Empire, although the exact proceedings are no longer known. It was assisted by an extensive secretarial bureaucracy under the reis ül-küttab for the drafting of appropriate documents and the <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> The Imperial Council remained the main executive organ of the Ottoman state until the mid-17th century, after which it lost most of its power {{to the office of the}} Grand Vizier. With the Tanzimat reforms of the early 19th century, it was eventually succeeded by a Western-style cabinet government.|$|E
2500|$|Amate {{paper was}} created {{as part of}} a line of {{technologies}} to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the Olmecs and Maya through a form of hieroglyphic writing. Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials. In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a writing surface, especially in the production of chronicles and the <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into [...] "books" [...] by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and are made of bark paper. These include the Dresden Codex from the Yucatán, the Fejérváry-Mayer Codex from the Mixteca region and the Borgia Codex from Oaxaca.|$|E

50|$|International {{trade is}} {{hampered}} by one country not recognising the quality controls {{in place in}} other countries - often due to standards being different or being incompatible with each other. At the 20th CGPM (1995), it was recognised that although ad-hoc recognition of instrument calibration between cooperating countries had been taking place for a hundred years, a need had arisen for a more comprehensive agreement. Consequently, the CIPM was mandated to investigate the setting up of a Mutual Recognition Agreement in respect of instrument calibration. Any such agreement would require the <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> that could demonstrate the traceability of calibrations back to the base standards. Such records would be recorded within an ISO 9000 framework. Four years later, in 1999 {{the text of the}} CIPM-MRA was agreed at the 21st CGPM.|$|E

At the same time, the absolute confidentiality of the 'seal of the confessional' is upheld.|$|E
