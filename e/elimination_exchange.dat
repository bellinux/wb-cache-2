We show that the effect of the <b>elimination</b> of the <b>exchange</b> rate on the optimal portfolio is twofold.

40|$|The <b>elimination</b> of <b>exchange</b> rate {{volatility}} among {{union members}} {{is widely considered}} {{as one of the}} main advantages of economic integration and, specifically, of monetary unions. Nonetheless, few papers find evidence of a significant impact of (bilateral) exchange rate volatility on growth. We argue that bilateral exchange rate volatility is an insufficient measure of trading risk since it does not include the volatility induced by trading partners. By devising an “export portfolio risk approach” we find that the variance of a portfolio including exchange rates with trading partners weighted for their relative export shares has significant impact on levels and growth of per capita income after controlling for physical and human capital, institutional and macroeconomic variables, access to ICT and other variables traditionally considered in growth estimates. The effect is robust to sensitivity analysis and to changes in sample composition.

40|$|Two {{seemingly}} unconnected empirical {{results suggest}} an intriguing mechanism. First, economic integration helps harmonize prices internationally, with trade being the primary channel (Rogoff 1996, Goldberg and Knetter 1997). Second, monetary union may greatly {{increase the amount}} of trade among members (Rose 2001). Putting these together, we see that formation of a monetary union may induce changes that help harmonise inflation rates. The effect might be large if the <b>elimination</b> of <b>exchange</b> rate volatility simultaneously leads to a large increase in intra-union trade and a big increase in the speed at which price shocks are transmitted across members' goods markets. This paper investigates part of this mechanism and finds that monetary union may indeed result in faster cross-border transmission of price movements via the import and export price channel which, in turn, would tend to homogenise price movements across the member countries of a monetary union.

40|$|From the Introduction]. Economic {{deregulation}} in many industrialised countries {{during the}} 1980 s, the liberalisation of capital movements within the European Union (EU) in 1990, {{and the establishment}} of the single market for financial services have radically transformed the regulatory framework of European financial markets. One of the main objectives of the single market programme (1985) was the opening of national markets {{in order to create a}} European financial area with the free provision of financial services. Its implementation started in 1993 with the application of the second banking directive. 1 In this context, monetary union is often seen as the accomplishment of the process of European financial integration. The <b>elimination</b> of <b>exchange</b> risk should indeed boost cross-border competition. The nature and speed of integration differ between wholesale and retail financial markets.

40|$|In {{financial}} economics, co-movements between equity {{returns are}} generally {{interpreted as a}} measure of equity market integration. In line with this idea, the paper investigates whether the euro equity markets have become less segmented over the last decade referring to three different estimates of pair-correlations, i. e. unconditional correlations, ex-post rolling estimates of correlations and dynamic conditional correlations (DCC). The analysis shows that pair-correlations within the euro area have indeed increased, suggesting higher financial integration of the euro equity markets. Additionally, the paper addresses the related issue of which factors have driven this integration process. The idea is that the extent of market integration may depend upon certain macroeconomic factors, that influence the degree of economic integration across countries, and upon the <b>elimination</b> of <b>exchange</b> rate volatility associated with Stage Three of EMU. The findings show that the increase in integration is explained by the relaxation of restrictions to capital mobility and of institutional barriers and by the economic convergence in Europe, while Stage Three of EMU has not further boosted integration.
