5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} Manchester United's sixth {{season in the}} Premier League, and their 23rd {{consecutive}} season in the top division of English football. The campaign ended in disastrous fashion, having been pipped to the Premier League title by Arsenal, who managed a ten-match winning streak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the season {{as well as being}} eliminated by league strugglers Barnsley and French outfit AS Monaco in the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, respectively. To make matters worse, United entered March still in contention for a League and European double after opening up a 12-point gap, regardless of the fact that nearest challengers Arsenal had three games in hand. Thus, the season ended with only the Charity Shield in the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004–05 NHL lockout {{canceled}} the 2004–05 season, Brodeur {{signed a contract}} extension with the Devils on January 27, 2006, that would pay him $31.2million over six years. In the 2005–06 season he posted 43 wins, adding onto his NHL records of what were now five 40-win seasons and ten consecutive 30-win seasons. After struggling early in the season, his improved play later on made him {{a finalist for the}} Vezina Trophy for the third straight year, and helped lead the Devils to a surprising comeback <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the season that resulted in them winning the Atlantic Division in the final game of the year. In {{the first round of the}} playoffs, he won a postseason series against the Rangers for the first time in his career, leading the Devils to a four-game sweep. But a 4–1 series loss to the Carolina Hurricanes eliminated the Devils in the next round.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Burnley's first full season with Owen Coyle as manager. Carlisle {{managed to keep}} {{his place in the}} team under the new regime and was a regular fixture in the team {{for the first six months}} of the season. However, he was dropped from the team for the match against Charlton on 31 January 2009 due to a lack of form. He remained out of the team for the whole of February 2009. He made his return to action on 3 March 2009, starting in the centre of defence in the 1–0 win over his old team, Blackpool, at Bloomfield Road. On his next league appearance he scored Burnley's first goal in a 4–2 victory against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor. He went on to score three further goals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the season, getting his name on the scoresheet against Nottingham Forest, Southampton and his former team, Queens Park Rangers. His goals helped Burnley to a fifth-placed finish in the Championship, and a place in the play-offs. He played in both legs of the semi-final against Reading as the team won 3–0 on aggregate to secure a place in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. Carlisle was handed the man of the match award for his performance as Burnley triumphed 1–0 against Sheffield United to earn promotion to the Premier League for the 2009–10 season.|$|E

Western Australia's captain at the time, Marcus North, was Glamorgan's overseas player for the previous season, and recommended him to the team's coach, Matthew Mott. Qualifying for Glamorgan as the holder of British citizenship by descent (through his mother), Hogan was originally scheduled {{to play for the}} team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the 2012 English season, but a change in Cricket Australia regulations meant {{he would have had to}} play any Australian domestic matches as an overseas player. He decided to postpone playing for Glamorgan until the 2013 English season, thus retaining eligibility to play as a non-overseas player for the remainder of the season in Australia. In July 2012, Hogan re-signed with the Hobart Hurricanes.|$|E
25|$|The Official History {{records that}} the AA {{artillery}} in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'. The regimental historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, {{which was a}} serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid height changes. The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one alternative site and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun laying (GL Mk I) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night. Harbour defence was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. 152 Battery dug in west of the harbour engaged 1000 enemy aircraft in a six-month period. 4th AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. In September 1941, the batteries of 51st HAA Rgt were relieved and left Tobruk by sea to rejoin RHQ for rest and refit in Palestine.|$|E

He added another 4-for-4 game to his résumé on July 29 against the Colorado Rockies. Bako hit [...]256 with two home runs, 17 RBIs, and 16 runs scored in the 1999 season; {{he was part of}} Houston's roster for the 1999 National League Division Series, but did not play. After one game for the Astros in 2000, Houston traded Bako to the Florida Marlins. He played his first game for Florida on April 13, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout. Bako played for the Marlins until July 20, batting [...]242 with 14 RBIs. He was waived on July 21 and claimed by the Atlanta Braves, one of the Marlins' division rivals.

500|$|The {{following}} season {{started off}} {{well for the}} Yankees, who {{led the league in}} the early going. But the Yankees were plagued by injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The Philadelphia Athletics, rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, regained first place when they beat the Athletics three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month, and clinched the pennant in the final weekend of the season. Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. He then slumped for {{the latter part of the}} season, and he hit just twelve home runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Ruth's batting average also fell to [...]323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs. The Yankees swept the favored Cardinals in four games in the World Series, with Ruth batting [...]625 and hitting three home runs in Game Four, including one off Alexander.|$|E
500|$|L'Arianna was {{composed}} as a festive {{piece for the}} wedding of {{the heir to the}} duchy, Francesco Gonzaga, to Margherita of Savoy, in May 1608. Monteverdi received the commission following L'Orfeos successful premiere at the court in February 1607. The libretto for L'Arianna was by Rinuccini, whose literary skills had earlier impressed Duke Vincenzo I of Mantua after a performance of Euridice. The composition of L'Arianna became a fraught affair for Monteverdi, being only one of three works that the duke required from him for the wedding—he had also to compose a musical prologue for Giovanni Battista Guarini's play L'idropica, and write the music for a dramatic dance, Il ballo delle ingrate. His life had been disrupted by the fatal illness of his wife Claudia; she died on 10 September 1607, but Monteverdi was given no respite by the duke. L'Arianna was largely composed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of 1607, an exertion that Monteverdi's biographer Hans Redlich describes as [...] "superhuman". Monteverdi felt slighted by the lack of acknowledgement from the duke for his efforts; nearly 20 years later, {{in a letter to the}} Mantua court secretary Alessandro Striggio the Younger, he wrote that he had almost killed himself when writing L'Arianna in such a hurry.|$|E
500|$|Rivera's 10saves in 10opportunities in April {{were his}} highest total {{for the opening}} month of a season. He {{converted}} his first 18 save attempts of the season until blowing a save against the Mets on May28; {{it was the first}} time that he blew a save and lost a game without recording an out. Rivera entered the midseason break with 30saves in 32opportunities and a 1.83ERA, and he was named an All-Star for the 13th time in his career, the second-most All-Star selections for a pitcher behind Warren Spahn's 17. During the All-Star Game, held at Citi Field in New York, Rivera was called upon to pitch in the eighth inning for his final All-Star appearance. As he trotted onto the field, players from both teams remained near their dugouts and joined fans in giving Rivera a standing ovation as he stood alone on the field. Rivera retired all three batters he faced, preserving his 0.00 career ERA in All-Star Games. He was named the All-Star Game MVP, making him the first reliever selected to an All-Star team to ever receive the award, as well as the first pitcher since Pedro Martínez in 1999 and the second Yankee ever after Derek Jeter in 2000. He became the first MLB player to be named the MVP of a World Series, League Championship Series, and All-Star Game. Rivera's performance dipped in the second half of the season, as he blew five save opportunities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> including three consecutive chances for the first time in his career. In a Fox Sports documentary chronicling his final season, entitled Being: Mariano, Rivera said that his farewell to baseball had mentally and physically drained him and that by September, he had [...] "no desire" [...] left for the sport.|$|E
