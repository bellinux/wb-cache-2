50|$|A single African bee sting {{is no more}} venomous than {{a single}} European bee sting, though African honeybees respond more quickly when {{disturbed}} than do European honey bees. They send out {{three to four times}} as many workers in response to a threat. They will also pursue an intruder for a greater distance from the hive. Although people have {{died as a result of}} 100-300 stings, it has been estimated that the average lethal dose for an adult is 500-1100 bee stings. In terms of <b>industrial</b> <b>honey</b> production, the African bee produces far less honey than its European counterpart, whilst producing more swarms and absconding (abandoning its nest). For this reason, African races of Honeybees are less desirable than European races, except where the proclivity of African bees give beekeepers no other option due to the Africans' tendency to invade and take over European nests.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Different {{health risks}} {{including}} haematotoxicity {{and weight loss}} have been reported for gasoline. Supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the toxicity effects of gasoline vapours exposure. Honey contains vitamins, and polyphenols that possess good antioxidant properties. The potential role of honey in preventing gasoline-induced haematotoxicity and weight loss was assessed in male rats. The rats were exposed to gasoline (11. 13 ± 1. 1 cm 3 /h) 6 hours/day, 6 days/week, for 11 weeks. Honey (1. 2 g/kg body weight/day) was administered for 11 weeks in one group and for 2 weeks in another group. The percentage weight gain and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly reduced in the gasoline exposed rats. On the other hand, the percentage of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow was higher in the gasoline exposed group. These findings suggest that gasoline vapours inhalation was associated with adverse alteration in weight, haematological indices, and bone marrow megakaryocytes of male rats. Administration of honey, did not improve the weight changes associated with gasoline exposure; it however improved the MCHC values and reduced the percentage of abnormal megakaryocytes. <b>Industrial</b> relevance. <b>Honey</b> is one of the famous natural products recognized for its enriched antioxidants composition which contribute significantly to its therapeutic effect in a number of diseases. The present study provides preliminary information for potential protective effect of tualang honey against the toxic effects of gasoline exposure in rat model. In {{view of the fact that}} exposure to constituents of gasoline is still rampant in most developing societies, the results of this study  may be used to further investigate the potential role of honey in ameliorating the toxicity effects of gasoline vapor exposure in rats.

40|$|Psyllium is {{the common}} name used for {{several members of the}} plant genus Plantago, whose seeds are commercially used for {{mucilage}} production. Owing to its considerable fiber amount it has been used as dietary fiber supplement. Psyllium has a strong gelling ability, even at low temperature, enabling its use as a gelling agent in the food industry. This work is part of a project to developing jellies enriched with fiber, honey and propolis, aiming to increase these products intake, with evident health benefits. The chemical characterization of psyllium was performed, with the following results (in dry matter) : total ash 2. 5 %, fat content 3. 4 % and total protein 1. 4 %. After qualitative acid hydrolysis polymeric sugars were quantified (in dry matter) : glucan 7. 3 %, xylan 61. 1 % and arabinan 22. 9 %. This means that total fiber content is about 90 %, being soluble fiber predominant, and allows classifying psyllium hemicellulose as an arabinoxylan. Psyllium functional properties were evaluated by water-binding capacity and swelling determination: 27. 1 g/g and 36. 9 ml/g, respectively. These properties are important in the food industry, but under certain circumstances may limit the food type that can be enriched with this fiber. An important part of the research consisted on the characterization of gels viscoelastic behavior and texture, which were prepared with different psyllium particle dimension (raw and ground) and concentration (2. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 3. 0 %). The Response Surface Methodology was used to study the effect of process conditions (time and temperature) on texture and color characteristics of gels. Texture properties of gels were evaluated by Texture Profile Analysis. Gels dynamic behaviour was studied by a sequence of oscillatory measurements of temperature, time and frequency sweeps. Psyllium gelling properties were improved with the reduction of the fiber particle dimension. Gels revealed potential viscoelastic properties that might be interesting in the <b>industrial</b> purpose of <b>honey</b> jelly production...|$|R
