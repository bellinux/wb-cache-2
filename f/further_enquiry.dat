25|$|In 2000, Morgan was {{the subject}} of an {{investigation}} after Suzy Jagger wrote a story in The Daily Telegraph revealing that he had bought £20,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the Mirror 's 'City Slickers' column tipped Viglen as a good buy. Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The 'City Slickers' columnists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code, and were sacked before the inquiry. In 2004, <b>further</b> <b>enquiry</b> by the Department of Trade and Industry cleared Morgan from any charges. On 7 December 2005 Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought £67,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his wife's name too.|$|E

[...] The 856-page positio was tabled at the CSS on July 1, 1994. In 2011, the positio was presented to a committee of expert theologians. Pope Francis, in an audience at the Vatican on Monday, December 9, 2013, with the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Angelo Amato, S.D.B., gave his assent to the finding that she had lived such a life of heroic virtue, and so she may now be known as Venerable.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{heavily in}} debt, with two {{creditors}} (whom he owed £12,500 and £10,400) threatening {{to speak to}} his mother (thereby exposing his fraud), Palmer attempted to take out life insurance on his brother, Walter, for the sum of £84,000. Unable to find a company willing to insure him for such a sum, he instead returned to the Prince of Wales Insurance Company, paying out a premium of £780 for a policy of £14,000. Walter was a drunk, and soon became reliant on his brother, who readily plied him with several bottles of gin and brandy a day. Walter Palmer died on 16 August 1855. [...] However the insurance company refused to pay up, and instead dispatched inspectors Simpson and Field to investigate. The pair found that William Palmer had also been attempting to take out £10,000 worth of insurance {{on the life of}} George Bate, a farmer who was briefly under his employment. They found that Bate was either misinformed or lying about the details of his insurance policy, and they informed Palmer that the company would not pay out on the death of his brother, and that they further recommended a <b>further</b> <b>enquiry</b> into his death.|$|E

2500|$|The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) {{was set up}} in January 1989 {{to provide}} expert advice to the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority on the health {{implications}} for the population of the Camelford area. In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium {{and that there was no}} increase in ill health from poisoned water. A <b>further</b> <b>enquiry</b> by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused [...] "real suffering" [...] in the community. However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that [...] "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," [...] and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of [...] "inaccurate and exaggerated" [...] claims of health damage by scientists and the news media. When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused [...] "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community." [...] One section was later amended to read [...] "alarming statements by pseudo-scientists" [...] rather than [...] "...by some scientists".|$|E

6000|$|Chad {{had been}} {{absent from the}} Boulevard Malesherbes--was absent from Paris altogether; he had learned that from the concierge, but had {{nevertheless}} gone up, and gone up--there were no two ways about it--from an uncontrollable, a really, if one would, depraved curiosity. The concierge had mentioned to him that {{a friend of the}} tenant of the troisieme was for the time in possession; and this had been Strether's pretext for a <b>further</b> <b>enquiry,</b> an experiment carried on, under Chad's roof, without his knowledge. [...] "I found his friend in fact there keeping the place warm, as he called it, for him; Chad himself being, as appears, in the south. He went a month ago to Cannes and though his return begins to be looked for it can't be for some days. I might, you see, perfectly have waited a week; might have beaten a retreat as soon as I got this essential knowledge. But I beat no retreat; I did the opposite; I stayed, I dawdled, I trifled; above all I looked round. I saw, in fine; and--I don't know what to call it--I sniffed. It's a detail, but it's as if there were something--something very good--TO sniff." ...|$|E
60|$|However, {{to make a}} <b>further</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{into the}} truth of this observation, I doubt not but there is reason to think that a great many of those encomiums given to ancient {{philosophers}} are taken upon trust, and by a sort of men who are not very likely to be at the pains of an enquiry that would employ so much time and thinking. For the usual ends why men affect this kind of discourse, appear generally to be either out of ostentation, that they may pass upon the world for persons of great knowledge and observation; or, what is worse, there are some who highly exalt the wisdom of those Gentile sages, thereby obliquely to glance at and traduce Divine Revelation, and more especially that of the Gospel; for the consequence they would have us draw is this: That, since those ancient philosophers rose to a greater pitch of wisdom and virtue than was ever known among Christians, and all this purely upon the strength of their own reason and liberty of thinking, therefore it must follow, that either all Revelation is false, or, what is worse, that it has depraved the nature of man, and left him worse than it found him.|$|E

60|$|Yes, she answered, {{there had}} been an accident. Did he suppose that seven scrimpy scraps of bacon was her notion of a lunch between four hungry persons? Did he, judging from himself, imagine that our family yielded only lunatics? Was it kind--was it courteous to his parents, to the mother he pretended to love, to the father whose grey hairs he was by his general {{behaviour}} bringing down in sorrow to the grave--to assume without <b>further</b> <b>enquiry</b> that their eldest daughter was an imbecile? (My hair, by-the-bye, is not grey. There may be a suggestion of greyness here and there, the natural result of deep thinking. To describe it in the lump as grey is to show lack of observation. And at forty-eight--or a trifle over--one is not going down into the grave, not straight down. Robina when excited uses exaggerated language. I did not, however, interrupt her; she meant well. Added to which, interrupting Robina, when--to use her own expression--she is tired of being a worm, is like trying to stop a cyclone with an umbrella.) Had his attention been less concentrated on the guzzling of cold bacon (he had only had four mouthfuls, poor fellow)--had he noticed the sweet patient child starving before his very eyes (this referred to Veronica)--his poor elder sister, worn out with work and worry, pining for nourishment herself, it might have occurred to even his intelligence that {{there had been}} an accident. The selfishness, the egotism of men it was that staggered, overwhelmed Robina, when she came to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|Even in North America, {{the first}} {{settlers}} in New England {{and other parts}} of that immense continent uniformly agreed that they detected among the inhabitants traces of an intimate connexion with Satan. It is scarce necessary to remark that this opinion was founded exclusively upon the tricks practised by the native powahs, or cunning men, to raise themselves to influence among the chiefs, and to obtain esteem with the people, which, possessed as they were professionally of some skill in jugglery and the knowledge of some medical herbs and secrets, the understanding of the colonists was unable to trace to their real source--legerdemain and imposture. By the account, however, of the Reverend Cotton Mather, in his Magnalia, book vi.,[6] he does not ascribe to these Indian conjurers any skill greatly superior to a maker of almanacks or common fortune-teller. [...] "They," [...] says the Doctor, [...] "universally acknowledged and worshipped many gods, and therefore highly esteemed and reverenced their priests, powahs, or wizards, who were esteemed as having immediate converse with the gods. To them, therefore, they addressed themselves in all difficult cases: yet could not all that desired that dignity, as they esteemed it, obtain familiarity with the infernal spirits. Nor were all powahs alike successful in their addresses; but they became such, either by immediate revelation, or in the use of certain rites and ceremonies, which tradition had left as conducing to that end. In so much, that parents, out of zeal, often dedicated their children to the gods, and educated them accordingly, observing a certain diet, debarring sleep, &c.: yet of the many designed, but few obtained their desire. Supposing that where the practice of witchcraft has been highly esteemed, there must be given the plainest demonstration of mortals having familiarity with infernal spirits, I am willing to let my reader know, that, not many years since, here died one of the powahs, who never pretended to astrological knowledge, yet could precisely inform such who desired his assistance, from whence goods stolen from them were gone, and whither carried, with many things of the like nature; nor was he ever known to endeavour to conceal his knowledge to be immediately from a god subservient to him that the English worship. This powah, being by an Englishman worthy of credit (who lately informed me of the same), desired to advise him who had taken certain goods which had been stolen, having formerly been an eye-witness of his ability, the powah, after a little pausing, demanded why he requested that from him, since himself served another God? that therefore he could not help him; but added, 'If you can believe that my god may help you, I will try what I can do; which diverted the man from <b>further</b> <b>enquiry.</b> I must a little digress, and tell my reader, that this powah's wife was accounted a godly woman, and lived in the practice and profession of the Christian religion, not only by the approbation, but encouragement of her husband. She constantly prayed in the family, and attended the public worship on the Lord's days. He declared that he could not blame her, for that she served a god that was above his; but that as to himself, his god's continued kindness obliged him not to forsake his service." [...] It appears, from the above and similar passages, that Dr. Cotton Mather, an honest and devout, but sufficiently credulous man, had mistaken the purpose of the tolerant powah. The latter only desired to elude the necessity of his practices being brought under the observant eye of an European, while he found an ingenious apology in the admitted superiority which he naturally conceded to the Deity of a people, advanced, as he might well conceive, so far above his own in power and attainments, as might reasonably infer a corresponding superiority in the nature and objects of their worship.|$|E
