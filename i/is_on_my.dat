Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I {{think there is no}} so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence.

500|$|In 1964, singer Irma Thomas {{went into}} the studio to record the single [...] "Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)". It was decided that the b-side, a cover of Kai Winding's [...] "Time <b>Is</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Side", needed {{additional}} lyrics, since the only words in the original composition were [...] "Time <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side" [...] and [...] "You'll come runnin' back." [...] Norman was contacted and composed {{the rest of the}} lyrics to the tune. The Rolling Stones also recorded the song with Norman's lyrics and released it as a single, which became the band's first hit to break the top ten. The Rolling Stones' releases did credit Norman as lyric writer for a number of years, but eventually his name was removed; in the early 1990s, he was told by the publisher that the credit was not legally binding, as it had been a [...] "clerical error".|$|E

[...] However, they were included on Rolling Stones, Now! (by contrast, only [...] "Little Red Rooster" [...] and [...] "The Last Time" [...] were released as singles in the UK during this period). [...] Although it appeared {{at the top of}} the British chart for one week, Jagger later commented, [...] "I still dig 'Little Red Rooster', but it didn't sell". Egan believes that actual sales of the record may have fallen short of previous Stones' singles.|$|E
500|$|Because of his damaged kidney, Hoffman was {{not allowed}} to play {{football}} or wrestle. Hoffman went to Savanna High School in Anaheim as had Glenn, which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother. Ed, who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old. Standing at just [...] and , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna, but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989. [...] Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball. [...] "I told them the one kidney I have <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right side. That's not the side that faces the pitcher when I hit, so it was O.K. They bought it", said Hoffman. He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a [...]371 batting average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow. Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long. Hoffman exhibited a strong throwing arm playing shortstop.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Time <b>Is</b> <b>On</b> <b>My</b> Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E
500|$|Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re-cut {{some old}} tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London {{in an attempt}} to commercialise the Wailers' sound. Bunny later {{asserted}} that these songs [...] "should never be released on an album ... they were just demos for record companies to listen to". In 1968, Bob and Rita visited songwriter Jimmy Norman at his apartment in the Bronx. Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's [...] "Time <b>Is</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Side" [...] (covered by the Rolling Stones) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix. A three-day jam session with Norman and others, including Norman's co-writer Al Pyfrom, resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. This tape is, according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae, {{as part of an effort}} to break Marley into the American charts. According to an article in The New York Times, Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds, adopting a doo-wop style on [...] "Stay With Me" [...] and [...] "the slow love song style of 1960's artists" [...] on [...] "Splish for My Splash". An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica, Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens, Bloomsbury, during 1972.|$|E
500|$|Jimmy Norman (August 12, 1937– November 8, 2011) was an American {{rhythm and}} blues and jazz {{musician}} and a songwriter. In his early career, Norman had a charting single of his own, [...] "I Don't Love You No More (I Don't Care About You)", as well as performing session work with Jimi Hendrix, but he is better known as a lyricist and songwriter. He wrote the expanded lyrics of the song [...] "Time <b>Is</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Side", which became a hit for The Rolling Stones,and later in 1985 re recorded and produced by Stephen Vanderbilt featuring [...] "St. Tropez" [...] as the A side of a 45 released on the album [...] "Home" [...] throughout Europe. Norman composed a number of songs performed by well-known musicians including Johnny Nash and Bob Marley. In 1969 he became involved with doo-wop band The Coasters, first as a producer {{and then as a}} touring member. He was also recording independently, releasing a solo album in 1998, the same year poor health forced him to retire from performance. Like many other musicians of his time, he was not financially prepared for retirement or heavy medical bills, and with few royalties for his writing soon found himself in economic crisis. With the assistance of charitable organization Jazz Foundation of America, Norman regained his feet and resumed performing, releasing his first wide distribution album in 2004, Little Pieces. He performed in the Manhattan area until shortly before his death.|$|E

2500|$|Initially Thomas {{recorded}} for Ron Records but, in 1961, {{she left for}} Minit Records, feeling that her original label did not pay her due royalties. This move paired her with Allen Toussaint, who both wrote and produced most of her work with Minit. As well as [...] "It's Raining", Thomas recorded other notable tracks such as [...] "Time <b>Is</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Side" [...] and [...] "Ruler of My Heart." [...] The name [...] "Naomi Neville" [...] was simply a pseudonym used by Toussaint, on many of his early compositions. Although most of her 1961–63 Minit recordings were written and produced by Toussaint, only one of these, [...] "Two Winters Long", made the national charts. [...] It spent three weeks on the Cashbox R chart in February 1963, peaking at no. 43.

2500|$|Fellow Penguin {{teammate}} Bill Guerin also analyzed Cooke's hit on Savard to Pittsburgh reporters.

[...] "I understand he (Cooke) <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> team but, hey, he's in a tough spot." [...] In a ruling, which has received wide criticism, Cooke was not given a suspension for the hit on Savard. On March 24, {{in response to the}} outcry over Cooke not being suspended, the league implemented a new rule aimed at prohibiting blindside hits to the head like the one Cooke delivered to Savard. In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, [...] "The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game." [...] Earlier, Bettman appeared on Leafs Lunch on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. [...] "I was very unhappy and upset with that hit," [...] said Bettman. [...] "I was more upset there was nothing (in the League rules) to do to punish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{initially}} {{signed as}} a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first {{made a name for}} himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music. Among his work for other artists, Thicke co-wrote [...] "Love <b>Is</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Side" [...] on Brandy's eponymous debut album; he also wrote for 3T's Brotherhood, and collaborated with Jordan Knight, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on several songs in Knight's 1999 album Jordan Knight including the Billboard top 10 hit [...] "Give It to You". According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him. He also co-wrote the song [...] "When You Put Your Hands on Me" [...] for Christina Aguilera's debut album and co-wrote and produced three songs for Mýa's sophomore release, Fear of Flying. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song [...] "Fall Again" [...] with Walter Afanasieff, which was intended to be a track on Michael Jackson's 2001 album Invincible, but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004 as an album track of his limited edition box set The Ultimate Collection. As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005.|$|E
