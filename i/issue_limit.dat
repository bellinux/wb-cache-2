40|$|The Superscalar Digital Signal Processor (SDSP) {{architecture}} is presented. Decode size, fetch efficiency, branch prediction, dynamic scheduling, resource allocation, issue rate, result write rate, and cache are discussed. Over 50 billion simulated cycles on seventeen different programs were run on {{over a dozen}} different configurations. Notably, results show that average instruction fetch places an upper bound on speedup and is the most critical factor in determining overall performance. In addition, a new approach in handling branch prediction is shown to significantly decrease the bad branch penaly. Furthermore, increasing the <b>issue</b> <b>limit</b> beyond the decode size is shown to improve performance, but for maximum improvement, {{the rate at which}} results are written should also be increased. Overall, the speedup for the SDSP is over {{two and a half times}} faster than an ideal scalar version...|$|E
