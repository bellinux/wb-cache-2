500|$|... he {{evidence}} moldering {{in county}} courthouses and the National Archives compels us to confront this extinguished past, {{to recognize the}} terrible contours of the record, to teach our children the truth of a terror that pervaded much of American life, to celebrate its end, to lift any shame on {{those who could not}} evade it. This book is not a call for financial reparations. Instead, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a formidable plea for a resurrection and fundamental reinterpretation of a tortured chapter in the collective American past.|$|E
500|$|Fuller {{agreed with}} the {{transcendental}} concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means [...] "that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so". She criticized people like Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like {{other members of the}} so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer Charles Capper has noted, she [...] "was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Hume wrote an {{extremely}} brief autobiographical essay titled [...] "My Own Life" [...] which summed up his entire life in [...] "fewer than 5 pages", and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. The scholar of 18th century literature Donald Seibert judged it a [...] "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere." [...] Hume here confesses his belief that the"love of literary fame" [...] had served as his [...] "ruling passion" [...] in life, and claims that this desire [...] "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." [...] One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that [...] with the initial literary reception of the Treatise, which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the Essays: [...] "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure [...] "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." [...] Hume thus suggests that [...] "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." [...] Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: [...] "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best." [...] Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that [...] "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that [...] "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that [...] "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." [...] Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: [...] " [...] I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained." ...|$|E
