40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} {{propagation}} performances for friction stir welded AA 7075 -T 6 and LC 4 CS (a Chinese brand aluminum alloy similar to AA 7075 -T 6) joints and their corresponding base materials have been investigated. It {{was found that}} the fatigue crack growth rates (<b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N)</b> for AA 7075 -T 6 welded joints along the weld center line, advanced and retracted side regions are all slower than that of LC 4 CS alloy, but the <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> values along the perpendicular direction of weld for both alloys are the approximate same values. The <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> along the weld center line is the lowest, the second is that of retracted and advanced side and the <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> along the vertical direction of weld is the highest. The <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> of AA 7075 -T 6 FS welds is slower at the range of low load Δ K compared to base material, but for the range of high Δ K, the <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> of AA 7075 -T 6 base material is slower. The fracture surface of crack growth along the weld center line is obviously different from that of advanced and retracted side regions and base materials. The typical fatigue striations can be observed across the surface of fatigue crack stable growth for advanced and retracted side regions and base material, but not any fatigue striation can be found along the fatigue fracture surface of weld center line. The resistance of fatigue crack propagation for AA 7075 -T 6 FS welds is better than that of LC 4 CS welds and the fine and equiaxed grains at nugget region have no good benefit to reduce the <b>d</b> <b>a</b> /d <b>N</b> of AA 7075 -T 6 and LC 4 CS FS welds...|$|R

While the calculated potential surfaces {{for the majority of}} the glycosidic linkages could be described by a single deep potential well, similar calculations for the M <b>a</b> <b>n</b> <b>a</b> l <b>d</b> M <b>a</b> <b>n</b> <b>a</b> and Mana 1 - 6 Manp linkages described a diffuse, shallow well, suggesting that a larger degree of flexibility exists about the latter. These conclusions are supported by the results of molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest that the N M R data should be interpreted in terms of a degree of flexibility about the M <b>a</b> <b>n</b> <b>a</b> l <b>d</b> M <b>a</b> <b>n</b> p and Manal- 6 Mana linkages.

Excavations brought to light many mud-brick structures inside the forecourt, among which the small courtyard of TT 14, and the entrance to two new tombs (T. 1 and T. 2), previously unknown and unrecorded. The two tombs were cut into the northern rock wall delimiting the forecourt. They present both a small window {{to the left of the}} main door, an unusual feature, already observed in M.
