25|$|The old marshal vainly endeavoured to {{keep the}} demands of his own Progressists {{reasonable}} in the Cortes of 1854–1856 and in the great towns, but their excessive demands for reforms and liberties played {{into the hands of}} a clerical and reactionary court and of the equally retrograde governing classes. The growing ambition of General O'Donnell constantly clashed with the opinions of Espartero, until the latter, <b>in</b> <b>sheer</b> disgust, resigned his premiership and left for Logroño, after warning the queen that a conflict was imminent between O'Donnell and the Cortes, backed by the Progressist militia. O'Donnell's pronunciamiento during 1856 ended the Cortes, and the militia was disarmed, after a struggle in the streets of the capital. Spanish political power was assumed again by the moderates during 1856.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>sheer</b> numbers, {{they are}} {{reputed to be}} one of the most {{abundant}} of all macroscopic animals, with estimates of 100,000 individuals per square meter of ground, essentially everywhere on Earth where soil and related habitats (moss cushions, fallen wood, grass tufts, ant and termite nests) occur. Only nematodes, crustaceans, and mites are likely to have global populations of similar magnitude, and each of those groups except mites is more inclusive: though taxonomic rank cannot be used for absolute comparisons, it is notable that nematodes are a phylum and crustaceans a subphylum. Most springtails are small and difficult to see by casual observation, but one springtail, the so-called snow flea (Hypogastrura nivicola), is readily observed on warm winter days when it is active and its dark color contrasts sharply with a background of snow.|$|E

25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then <b>in</b> <b>sheer</b> amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, having {{retreated to}} the island of Lobau after the battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{knew that he had}} failed in his attempt to cross the Danube and was so {{astonished}} by the severity of the setback that he remained in unaccustomed inaction for 36 hours. After recovering his usual drive, his immediate concern was to improve the dire situation of his army, which was in very bad shape and virtually trapped on Lobau island, after the Danube had swollen. With his usual tireless activity, he supervised the transformation of Lobau island into a huge army base. The French built temporary campaign hospitals for his 20,000 wounded, as well as warehouses and barracks, which sheltered a numerous permanent military garrison. As soon a secure bridge was built, the Emperor had the wounded and a part of the troops transferred to the mainland, but maintained IV Corps on the island. He did not intend to abandon this position, as he was planning {{to use it as a}} springboard for his upcoming crossing. His next task was to rebuild the army. Casualties had been roughly equal to those of the enemy, but, with fewer troops engaged, some of Napoleon's battalions needed rebuilding from scratch. Losses in officers in particular had been extremely high and proved difficult to replace. Maréchal Jean Lannes, one of Napoleon's ablest commanders and a personal friend, had been mortally wounded in action and died nine days after the battle. Another irreplaceable loss was Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire, who had been created a Marshal of the Empire just a month before, in recognition of his brilliant conduct during the earlier campaign, but received a mortal wound during the battle and died before the coveted baton could arrive from Paris. Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne, another famous general was killed in action at the head of his cuirassiers and the commander in chief of the artillery, Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons, became severely ill and had to leave his command a few weeks after the battle. Despite all these setbacks, the army and its officers retained total confidence in Napoleon's ability to lead them to victory and morale remained high. Evidence of this came a couple of days before the newly planned crossing of the Danube, when Napoleon's most senior Corps commander, Maréchal André Masséna fell from his horse and badly injured his foot, rendering him unable to ride for some time. <b>In</b> <b>sheer</b> contrast with Hiller's gesture, Masséna, although in significant pain, made arrangements to lead his men in battle from a phaeton and vowed to retain his command, much to the Emperor's relief.|$|E

He also wrote that [...] "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor". Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme Star Trek fans are people interested in hearing the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film [...] "seemingly interminable" [...] and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they [...] "rival black holes <b>in</b> <b>sheer</b> self-absorption". According to John Henzell, writing for The Press of New Zealand, Mind Melds trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical.|$|E

500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding...

[...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations <b>in</b> <b>sheer</b> scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short.
