5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point, {{with the}} {{questioning}} of Acoli, that {{the accounts of}} the confrontation begin to differ (see the witnesses section below). However, in the ensuing shootout, Trooper Foerster was shot twice {{in the head with}} his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{privileges}} of the Hasekura family were abolished {{at this point}} by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, in 1640, that Hasekura's Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Twentymiles (32.2km) {{north of}} US-412, the highway meets US-60 near Lamont. The two roads share a brief {{concurrency}} before splitting off again. Eightmiles (12.9km) north of this, SH-74 intersects with SH-11 between Deer Creek and Numa, Oklahoma. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> intersection that the designation ends.|$|E

5|$|In the southwest, Ecgberht was {{defeated}} in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> date that the independence {{of one of the}} last British kingdoms may be considered to have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The river Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{begins in}} Ludington at the {{intersection}} of James Street and Ludington Avenue. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> intersection where US10 turns southward and heads to the Ludington–Manitowoc ferry docks. From here, M-116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about one-half mile (0.8km) before turning north on Lakeshore Drive. The road continues as North Lakeshore Drive through resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery. Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club, M-116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park. The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route, through an area of sand dunes, until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park.|$|E
5|$|M-43 and M-89 run {{concurrently}} for a mile {{north of}} Richland before M-89 heads {{off to the}} west while M-43 continues north. After the concurrency ends, M-43 turns east and then back north to run between Little Long and Gull lakes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point where M-43 begins its northward trek. The road continues on a general north-northeast track through rural areas and beside several lakes in Barry County before meeting M-179 and M-37. M-43 merges with the latter highway and together they run into Hastings. Downtown, M-37 leaves town to the south, while M-43 heads north before curving around the east, passing through farmfields approaching the community of Woodland. After leaving town, the road meets M-66, and together they head north to a junction with M-50.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because {{of the need for}} a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{novel of the}} series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in America and other {{countries}} as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, {{it is apparent that}} some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June27 and tracked westward {{to reach the}} eastern Pacific on July8. There, the system steadily gained organization and was declared a tropical depression by 1200UTC on July14. Moving slowly northwest, a low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature environment allowed the system to strengthen to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on July15. Following {{the development of a}} curved convection band and appearance of an eye on satellite, Cosme was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 1800UTC the next day; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time that the system attained its peak with winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987mb (hPa; 29.15inHg). Cosme tracked over ever cooler waters beginning at that time, causing the system to weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength. It turned west {{as a result of an}} intensifying ridge of high pressure to its north while continuing to deteriorate in organization. At 1800UTC on July18, Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific, and by 1800UTC on July22, no longer sustained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation early on July25.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{first heard}} of the Báb when he was 27, and {{received}} a visitor sent by the Báb, Mullá Husayn, telling him of the Báb and his claims. Bahá'u'lláh became a Bábí and helped to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of Núr, where he became {{recognized as one of}} its most influential believers. His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as Táhirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping. Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of Khorasan, where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> conference that Bahá'u'lláh took on the name Bahá.|$|E
5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes {{that some of his}} memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{toppling}} of the Stroessner regime, Roa Bastos won the Premio Cervantes (Cervantes Prize), {{awarded by}} the Spanish Royal Academy {{in partnership with}} the Spanish government, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Spanish-language literature. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time that Roa Bastos began to travel frequently [...] between Paraguay and France. In 1991, representing Paraguay, Roa Bastos signed The Morelia Declaration [...] "demanding the reversal of the ecological destruction of the planet." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time that Roa Bastos again became an active novelist and screenwriter.|$|R

25|$|During {{his time}} in Leningrad, Bakhtin shifted his view away from the {{philosophy}} characteristic of his early works and towards the notion of dialogue. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time that he began his engagement {{with the work of}} Fyodor Dostoevsky. Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Art is considered to be Bakhtin’s seminal work, a work in which Bakhtin introduces three important concepts.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of the art}} {{of earlier}} {{cultures}} – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates. One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.|$|E
25|$|If one doubles ℂ, the {{construction}} yields quaternions, and doubling again produces octonions, also called Cayley numbers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that Dickson contributed to uncovering algebraic structure.|$|R
