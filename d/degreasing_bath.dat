40|$|International audienceIn {{the metal}} {{finishing}} or aeronautical industries, efficient degreasing of metallic alloy surfaces {{is an essential}} step. This step was first performed with halogenated solvents. Legislation has involved since 1999 their replacement with green cleaners due to the hazardous effects of solvents on human health and on environment. Aqueous cleaners, commonly called detergents, are widely used as an alternative. The monitoring of such degreasing baths is usually realized by alkaline titration or conductimetry. However these techniques do not provide significant information {{on the state of}} degreasing baths. In this study a new method is proposed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). This technique can evaluate the size of the micelles formed in the <b>degreasing</b> <b>bath.</b> The free and "full of oil" micelles can be identified and quantified due to their different sizes. The contamination rate and the loss of detergent all along the use of the bath can be determined with these new indicators. After a validation step with prepared degreasing solutions, this method has allowed monitoring precisely industrial degreasing baths, reducing the frequency of the baths replacement, the volume of aqueous effluents and optimizing baths management...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafiltration of {{emulsified}} oil {{in water}} wastestreams from waste cutting and grinding operations, waste rolling oil solutions, and alkaline <b>degreasing</b> <b>baths</b> can produce an effluent water phase that is acceptable for discharge to sewer systems. Since ultrafiltration membranes {{act as a}} physical barrier between the wastestream and the clean water effluent, operator or flow caused upsets are prevented, ensuring no carryover of oil to the effluent. The effluent (permeate) from the ultrafiltration system is usually of sufficient quality for discharge to a sanitary sewer system. The permeate, as a rule, contains less than 100 mgll of freon-extractable oil and grease and less than 10 mgll suspended solids. The ultrafiltration process also produces a liquid oil concentrate containing up to 60 % oil and solids, which can be disposed of by hauling or incineration. The concentrate will be only 3. 5 % of the original volume. No sludge containing large amounts of chemicals and heavy metals is produced in ultrafiltration because no such chemicals are required as in other methods of treating oily emulsions. Ultrafiltration {{has been found to}} be the most costeffective treatment method for treatment of oillwater emulsions in many applications...|$|R
40|$|EP 1162446 A UPAB: 20020508 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{feeding the}} liquid to a container with a capillary for drop formation. A constant inner container volume is only partly filled with liquid and closed air tight so an increasing pressure difference builds {{up between the}} constant inner volume and the exterior when drops occur. The number of drops per time interval or {{the time for a}} given number of drops is measured and compared with reference values to derive the concentration. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method involves feeding the liquid to a container (1) with a capillary (2) for drop formation at an outlet (4) in its bottom region. A constant inner volume of the container is only partly filled with liquid (3) and is closed air tight so that an increasing pressure difference builds up between the constant inner volume and the exterior when drops occur. The number of drops per time interval or the time for a given number of drops is measured and compared with reference values to determine the concentration. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an arrangement for determining the concentration of surface active substances in a liquid and a use of device for automatic real-time concentration monitoring of cleaners, e. g. in cleaning and <b>degreasing</b> <b>baths.</b> USE - For determining the concentration of surface-active substances in a liquid. ADVANTAGE - Enables simple and inexpensive concentration determination or monitoring...|$|R
30|$|The MgO {{substrates}} {{were first}} <b>degreased</b> by ultrasonic <b>bath</b> in acetone, followed by ethanol. After being {{introduced into the}} MBE growth chamber (ultra-high vacuum environment, with a base pressure of 10 - 9 mbar), the substrates were annealed at 420 °C for 60 min while {{the power of the}} radiofrequency plasma source was set to 250 W and the oxygen partial pressure maintained at 5 × 10 - 5 mbar. The detailed experimental process of plasma-assisted MBE can be found elsewhere [6, 7]. During growth of ZnO films, the temperature of elemental zinc source (with a purity of 99.99999 %) was maintained at 330 °C, and the oxygen partial pressure was kept at 1 × 10 - 5 mbar with the power of plasma source at 180 W. All the films reported in this work were grown at these conditions for 60 min. The only growth parameter that changed for each film is the substrate temperature, which ranges from 100 °C to 480 °C. In situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) was used to examine the surface structure of the MgO substrate (before depositing ZnO) and the ZnO films (after the deposition). The film roughness was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The polar and nonpolar structures of the ZnO films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu anode (λKα 1 = 1.54056 Å). The electronic structures of the thin films were probed by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). The component analysis of XAS was done through first principles' all-electron calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) [8] using generalized gradient approximations [9], as implemented in the Wien 2 k package (Vienna, Austria) [10]. A dense k-point mesh of 22 × 22 × 12 was used to obtain a well-converged charge density, and the projected density of states (PDOS) of ZnO was calculated and compared with the experimental XAS spectra.|$|R
