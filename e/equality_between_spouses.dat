5000|$|Marriages {{throughout}} history were arranged between families, especially before the 18th century. The practices varied by culture, but usually involved the legal transfer of dependency {{of the woman}} from her father to the groom. The emancipation {{of women in the}} 19th and 20th centuries changed marriage laws dramatically, especially in regard to property and economic status. By the mid-20th century, many Western countries had enacted legislation establishing legal <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> in family law. The period of 1975-1979 saw a major overhaul of family laws in countries such as Italy,Spain, Austria, West Germany, and Portugal. In 1978, the Council of Europe passed the Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law.

5000|$|In Quebec, women's rights within {{marriage}} and family law have advanced slower than {{in the rest of}} Canada. Quebec has been slow on giving civil rights to married women: until 1954, a married woman was legally listed as [...] "incapable of contracting", together with minors, [...] "interdicted persons", [...] "persons insane or suffering a temporary derangement of intellect ... or who by reason of weakeness of understanding are unable to give a valid consent", and [...] "persons who are affected by civil degradation." [...] The removal of the married woman from this list however, did little to improve her legal situation, due to marriage laws which restricted her rights and gave the husband legal authority over her: legal incapacity was still the general rule. A major change followed in 1964: Bill 16 (An Act respecting the legal capacity of married women) removed the obligation of the wife to obey her husband, and gave the married woman full legal capacity subject to restrictions that may result from the matrimonial regime. However, discriminatory provisions resulting from matrimonial regimes and from other legal regulations still remained. In July 1970, Bill 10 came into force, reforming matrimonial regimes, and improving the situation of married women. In 1977 another important change took place: the wife obtained equal rights with the husband with regard to legal authority over the children during marriage, abolishing the previous rule of 'paternal authority' which gave the husband more legal rights with regard to judicial matters concerning the children; the new law created the concept of parental authority shared equally between the wife and husband. A major change also happened in April 1981, when new family regulations based on gender equality came into force. Other reforms followed throughout the 1980s, including the introduction of the concept of family patrimony in 1989, in order to ensure financial <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> when the marriage ends. On January 1, 1994 the new Civil Code of Quebec came into effect, replacing the old one. This new code contains the current family law of Quebec, and it is based on gender equality: article 392 reads: [...] "The spouses have the same rights and obligations in marriage." ...|$|E
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolMarital agreements have been used for the division of matrimonial property upon divorce by couples for several years. However, their enforcement has been challenging. In Kenya the Matrimonial Property Act allows spouses to make antenuptial/pre-nuptial agreements for the division of matrimonial property upon divorce. It however does not recognize post-nuptial and settlement agreements. This may pose a challenge to the realization of equality as per Article 45 (3) of the Constitution. This research has looked into the importance of recognizing post-nuptial and settlement agreements and how they contribute towards promoting <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> in the ownership of matrimonial property. The study was conducted through a review of existing literature on the subject of marital property agreements. It has also included a comparative analysis of the South African and English law on marital property agreements. The aim of the comparative analysis was to identify best practices from these jurisdictions that {{can be applied to the}} Kenyan system. Additionally, a historical analysis of the Kenyan matrimonial property laws has been done so as to understand the importance of ensuring <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> in the ownership of matrimonial property. In order to ensure that marital property agreements promote <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses,</b> the study recommends that there should be principles or guidelines that direct the court in dividing matrimonial property upon divorce as well as in the implementation and enforcement of marital agreements and finally that the law should give explicit recognition to post-nuptial and settlement agreement...|$|E

40|$|Community {{property}} {{is thought to}} be a more equitable marital property regime than the common law because we assume that providing each spouse with an interest in fifty percent of the family’s income also provides a substantial amount of <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses.</b> Historically, however, as the regime operated in the United States, it was not especially favorable to wives. Although the concept implied a partnership between spouses, in practice wives were denied rights a partner would expect to enjoy. This article examines how women lobbied to enlarge the protection California wives enjoyed under the state’s community property regime in the early twentieth century. Women adopted a strategy that does not conform to Progressive Era stereotypes. Women’s groups argued that couples would receive a federal income tax reduction if the state’s property system gave more rights to wives. Women’s use of these anti-tax arguments helped further their goals of equalizing spouses’ rights and obligations until the tacit political alliance of women and wealthy taxpayers unwound...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the experience of female victims of domestic violence, who forfeited the lawsuits against their aggressors. The interviews were oriented by the question: What was your experience of forfeiting the denunciation of your aggressor? Three themes emerged from the convergence of the testimonies: time passed from the aggression to the denunciation and then to the forfeiting; the partner, the family, the women's precinct; reflecting about the experience, which described the studied phenomenon. The women expressed ambiguous feelings for their aggressor: affection, anger, humiliation and fear. They recognize that they are dominated and humiliated, but notions of justice and <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> do not appear in the testimonies. Forfeiting can be understood in the context of the reproduction of the traditional family structure, conditioned to economic and social factors. Results highlight implications about the role of the Women's Precinct and the healthcare institutions in the care for women who were victims of domestic violence...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} work–family reconciliation processes {{in order to}} understand if, over the course of marital life, women become socially closer or further away from their partner. Drawing on work–life interviews with highly qualified women in Portugal and Britain, we compare these processes in two societies with different historical and social backgrounds. Findings reveal three main configurations of social (in) equality which emerge during married life: growing inequality in favour of the man, in favour of the woman or <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses.</b> With due attention to the importance of national specific factors, we present three main conclusions. First, (in) equality is built up over the course of marital life and female strategies for reconciling family and work are at the core of this process. Second, the national specificities can mould the effects of cross-national gender mechanisms. Third, the intersection between cross-cultural phenomena such as conservative attitudes towards domestic work and national specificities (such as the availability of part-time options) is a rather complex process which needs further research...|$|E

These Nordic countries are contrasted with Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the mid- 1990 s, and include some comparisons {{to the situation}} in the 1980 s. While all these countries have experienced the same general changes in women's roles and positions, when these began and how fast they have progressed vary greatly. There is every reason to expect substantial country differences a the end of the 20 th century, and that the four Nordic countries as a group have moved closer to realizing the political goals of gender equality in the labor market and a lessening of women's economic independence on men. There are three parts to the empirical analysis. The first is an examination of the gender differences in earnings for adults aged between 18 and 60. The second part concerns women's economic dependence on the men they live with and how much having small children increases that dependence. The third part of the analysis takes up the question of how more <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> affects their dependence on each other and the inequality of economic risks...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the status of spouses by {{business}} law of the Organization for the Harmonization of African Business Law (OHADA) is referring to general commercial law and company law. The OHADA legislator values the status of spouses devoting <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses,</b> through the possibility {{for them to be}} able to be involved in low risk companies; the recognition of the de facto company between them and the right granted to each power, under the same conditions, benefit from the commercial lease originally attached to privileges. The consideration that the OHADA law grants the quality of husband appears in heritage protection thereof, insofar as it puts it away in case of depletion bad deal made by one of them. This is why the prohibition for spouses to be involved in the unlimited risk firms and the requirement of a separate trade as a condition for the spouse of the trader can also acquire the same status. But the heritage protection system spouse taken from the OHADA business law is supplemented by certain mechanisms of civil law, including matrimonial property regimes, although not all have the same efficiency. Indeed, among the two groups of matrimonial property regimes are known as separation schemes and those of the community property, only the first effectively protect the couple's assets. This objective likely was not assigned to the second from the design. These look more forward the merger of most of the assets of the couple without the slightest idea of calculation...|$|E

Darba mērķis ir izteikt argumentētu viedokli svarīgākajos problēmjautājumos, t. i., 1) jautājumā par laulāto kopīgās mantas sastāva un tās sadalījuma laulāto starpā noteikšanu, kur būtiska nozīme ir likuma noteikumiem par laulāto pierādīšanas pienākumu, 2) jautājumā par viena laulātā rīcību ar laulības laikā iegūto mantu un šādas rīcības tiesiskajām sekām, kur būtiska nozīme ir likuma noteikumiem par trešo personu (labticīgo ieguvēju) aizsardzību, un 3) jautājumā par laulāto kopīgās mantas dalīšanas pareizu izpratni. Lai sasniegtu šo mērķi, darbā ir noskaidrots „mantas” jēdziens, aplūkoti laulāto mantas veidi un to rašanās (iegūšanas) priekšnoteikumi, analizētas laulāto mantas masu mijiedarbības sekas un piedāvāts risinājums tam, kā tiesību tālākveidošanas ceļā pamatot laulātā tiesību uz atbilstošu atlīdzību par viņa izdarīto ieguldījumu otram laulātajam atsevišķi piederošajā mantā.

Annotation This {{thesis is}} devoted to the concept of ‘matrimonial property’ under {{statutory}} matrimonial property regime (see Sections 89 – 110 of the Civil Law). The objective of the thesis is to express a well-reasoned point of view (to provide a uniform solution) as to important problem issues, i. e. 1) the issue related to determination of the composition of joint matrimonial property and division thereof (incl. separation of joint property from the separate property of each spouse) where significant role is played by the provisions of law imposing the burden of proof on spouses; 2) the issue related to acts by one spouse with the property acquired during the course of marriage (in particular, immovable property) and legal consequences of such acts where significant role is played by the provisions of law protecting third parties (acquirers in good faith); and 3) the issue related to correct understanding of the division of joint matrimonial property where it is important to determine the objective of such division. As a result of analysis of rules of law, case law and legal literature, there are conclusions and suggestions provided in this thesis on how to interpret and apply the provisions of law governing the above mentioned issues. Considering that Sections 89 – 110 of the Civil Law governing the statutory matrimonial property regime as applicable today are drawn based on respective provisions of 89 – 110 of the Civil Law dated 1937 (by harmonising them with the principle of <b>equality</b> <b>between</b> <b>spouses)</b> {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the basic provisions of matrimonial property concept, which set forth ‘husband’s management system’ (and which were applicable in late 30 -ies of 20 th century), and basic provisions governing the so called ‘equal spouses’ management system’ nowadays. It is concluded in this thesis that both systems are based on the so called ‘principle of separate ownership’. In the second part of the thesis, opinions on all three above mentioned problem issues expressed in the existing legal literature and case law have been summarised and described, reasons (causes) of variety of existing opinions have been clarified, as well as criteria (principle of separate ownership, concept and types of matrimonial property, aggregations of property, objective of separation of joint property of spouses) have been identified, according to which criteria a uniform solution needs to be found in relation to the said issues. 2 The third part of the thesis reviews the term ‘property’ (its legal nature, contents and types thereof, principle of surrogation, as well as the issue related to segregating the property from similar aggregations). In consideration of the concept of property the thesis establishes the concept of ‘matrimonial property’, types thereof and aggregations of matrimonial property, as well as analyses the legal segregation of aggregations of property of the spouses. In addition, this part analyses the issue related to interaction of aggregations of matrimonial property, reasons thereof and legal consequences in case of termination of marriage. In the fourth part, the concept of ‘separate property’ of each spouse has been reviewed and types of such property, i. e. the basis of creation (acquisition) thereof, as set forth in Section 91, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law, have been analysed. Particular attention {{is devoted to}} the contract on designation of separate property (see Section 91, Paragraph 1, Sub-Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law) and to the income from separate property of one spouse (legal nature of such income) with the participation of other spouse (see Section 91, Paragraph 1, Sub-Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law in the light of Section 89, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Law). The fifth part of the thesis explores the concept of ‘joint property’ of spouses, basis of creation (acquisition) thereof, issue related to division of joint matrimonial property (or proportion of ownership) between the spouses, as well a...|$|E
