40|$|This thesis {{utilizes}} {{previously described}} manufacturing and design techniques {{for the creation}} of a PDMS-glass bonded microfluidic device, capable of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS has been used across various fields of research for different diagnostic needs. The major aim of this thesis was to capture cancerous and non-cancerous cells between micron sized electrodes within a microfluidic path, and to complete analysis on the measured impedances recorded from the two differing cell types. Two distinct ranges of impedance frequency were analyzed – the α <b>dispersion</b> <b>range,</b> which quantifies the impedance of the membranes of the cells of interest, and the β <b>dispersion</b> <b>range,</b> which quantifies the impedance of the cytosol of the cells of interest. This thesis is unique in the fact that it looks at the cellular impedances of two types of neural cells, which has not been documented previously in literature. The type of cancerous cells analyzed were Neuro- 2 -A cells, an immortalized line of murine glio/neuroblastoma. The type of non-cancerous cells analyzed were murine primary astrocytes, a mortal line of neurological support cells found throughout the nervous system, and with great abundance in the brain. By using a LabView program coded by a previous Cal Poly student, a sweep scan across a wide frequency range was completed on both cell types, and statistical analysis was completed on target frequencies of interest. A significant difference was found between the two cell lines’ membrane impedances, however no difference was found between the cytoplasm impedances. In total, this thesis aimed to fabricate a reusable microfluidic device capable of EIS for future Cal Poly students, create a protocol suitable for cell culturing and device operation, and to lay a foundation of knowledge for impedance comparisons regarding neural cancerous and non-cancerous cells...|$|E
40|$|The long-wavelength, weak-dispersion {{limit of}} the {{discrete}} nonlinear Schrödinger equation with long-range dispersion is analytically considered. This continuum approximation is carried out irrespective of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>range</b> and hence can be assumed exact in the weak dispersion regime. For nonlinear Schrödinger equations showing finite dispersion extents, the long-range parameter is still a relevant control parameter allowing to tune the dispersion from short-range to long-range regimes {{with respect to the}} dispersion extent. The long-range Kac-Baker potential becomes unappropriate in this context owing to an "edge anomaly" consisting of vanishing maximum dispersion frequency and group velocity(and in turn soliton width) in the "Debye" limit. An improved Kac-Baker potential is then considered which gives rise to a non-zero maximum frequency, and allows for soliton excitations with finite widths in the nonlinear Schrödinger system subjected to the long-range but finite-extent dispersion...|$|E

The requirement for two different catalyst functionalities in the reduction of CO 2 with hydrogen on Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/MWCNT catalysts was also substantiated.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of hourly wages in Austria hardly changed between 1996 and 2002. Somewhat weaker growth {{at the bottom}} of the distribution implies that wage inequality increased slightly. Compared with other EU countries, however, the distribution of wages remained remarkably stable in Austria. A decomposition of the changes in the wage distribution shows that the relatively small overall change is attributable to some contrasting developments. Apparently, both market-driven and predetermined factors contributed to this marginal increase in wage inequality. In particular, higher education levels and higher returns to education caused stronger growth in the upper wage <b>dispersion</b> <b>range.</b> At the same time, the rise in women’s participation in the workforce was one of the main reasons for lower wages to grow less strongly.

Both {{strength}} and elastic modulus of rocks are usually determined by compression testing at the mesoscopic scale (UNE-EN 1926; ASTMD 3148 - 96), {{and the values}} obtained are representative of homogeneous rocks.

Four varieties of brecciated carbonates (limestones and dolostones) were studied. These rocks have a very complex fabric, presenting a dense network of fractures and clasts between fractures (mm-cm size). The fractures are completely filled with calcite cement, and clasts can have one or two different textures, each presenting differences in crystal size, mineralogy and porosity percentage and type. Samples measuring 4 x 4 x 4 mm were obtained in order to test each texture individually. These micro-samples were tested in a uniaxial compression press and the stress-strain curve was recorded. In addition, mean strength and Young’s moduli were calculated for each texture.
