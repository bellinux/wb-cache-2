5|$|Mary Kay Place as Sister Gladys Davis, Aaron's deeply {{religious}} mother, who, despite showing unconditional {{love and affection}} toward Aaron before he leaves for Los Angeles, cannot accept the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son is gay.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Grace (Debra Messing) contemplates {{having an}} affair with a married man, while Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a new career as the host of his new talk show Jack Talk. Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) tries to hide from Karen (Megan Mullally) the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband, Stan, is alive and faked his death due to {{troubles}} with the mob. Will also tries to stop his former boss, Malcolm (Baldwin), from dating Karen.|$|E
5|$|Poonam (Amrita Rao) is {{a middle}} class girl {{who lives in the}} small town of Madhupur. After the death of her parents, when she was very young, her uncle Krishnakant (Alok Nath) {{fulfilled}} the void of a father in her life. However, her aunt (Seema Biswas) is jealous and unable to accept Poonam as her own child, driven by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> own daughter Rajni (Amrita Prakash) is dark in complexion and less beautiful than Poonam. Harishchandra (Anupam Kher), a renowned businessman, from New Delhi has two sons, Sunil (Samir Soni) who has married Bhavna (Lata Sabharwal), and Prem (Shahid Kapoor), who is a soft-spoken and well-educated person.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice {{coloured}} slightly, a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> escaped neither <b>her</b> sister nor Geoffrey.|$|R
50|$|Cristina, in her {{university}} essay, acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>her</b> life rests {{firmly and}} happily on the simple <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she is <b>her</b> mother's daughter.|$|R
60|$|She was so very pretty, and withal {{so utterly}} {{unconscious}} of it, or perhaps so consciously superior to it, {{that one was}} provoked into a more critical examination of her face. But this only resulted in a reiteration of her beauty, and perhaps the added <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> dark eyes were very womanly, her rich complexion eloquent, and her chiselled lips fell enough to be passionate or capricious, notwithstanding that their general effect suggested neither caprice, womanly weakness, nor passion.|$|R
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to deal with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
60|$|She left willingly; for the <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> <b>her</b> last {{conversation}} with her cousin Harry had made the situation as uncomfortable to her {{as if he had}} unceremoniously deluged her with a pailful of cold water.|$|R
500|$|Once again, Savige {{would not}} escape controversy. In this case, {{difficulties}} {{arose from the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Herring</b> failed {{to make it clear}} to Savige and Wilton exactly what was meant by [...] "threaten". What would end up being threatened by Savige's very success was Blamey's plan for the capture of Lae, which called for the Japanese defenders of Lae to be drawn away towards Salamaua. The campaign also included an acrimonious exchange between Savige and American commanders that threatened Allied harmony. This arose, ironically, because of Herring's deliberately vague instructions, which he hoped would ensure Allied harmony.|$|R
25|$|Chang {{lives in}} west London with her husband, the Irish {{historian}} Jon Halliday, who specialises in history of Asia. She {{was able to}} visit mainland China to see her family, with permission from the Chinese authorities, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> all <b>her</b> books are banned.|$|R
5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{kidnapping}} of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 {{years old at}} the time and was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California campus in Berkeley accompanied by two young girls on August 24 and 25 that same year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was successfully identified as Jaycee Dugard who was by then 29 years old.|$|E
25|$|The first {{witness for}} the Crown was Suzanne Pilley's mother, Sylvia Pilley. She spoke to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} had had a 'turbulent on-off relationship' with David Gilroy, {{and that she had}} previously cohabited with him on a temporary basis.|$|E
50|$|Trooper Hook is a 1957 Western film {{starring}} Joel McCrea as {{the title}} character and Barbara Stanwyck as the woman he frees from the Indians. The <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> during <b>her</b> captivity, she has had a son by a much-feared chief makes her situation very difficult.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, Arabella," [...] said Jude {{without a}} smile. [...] "But I don't want {{anything}} more than I've had." [...] The <b>fact</b> was <b>that</b> <b>her</b> unexpected presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for strong liquor as completely {{as if it had}} whisked him back to his milk-fed infancy.|$|R
5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> brought <b>her</b> into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} The Well of Loneliness.|$|R
25|$|In the {{documentary}} , filmmakers Halfdan Muurholm and Casper Erichsen portray a 23-year-old Herero woman, who {{is aware of}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> great-grandmother was raped by a German soldier. The documentary explores the past and the way Namibia deals with it now.|$|E
25|$|Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe {{initially}} resents {{but gradually}} accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses {{to face the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max. Max tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts.|$|E
25|$|After a few weeks, {{many of the}} Queen's English maids {{were sent}} away, but Mary was allowed to stay, {{probably}} due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> father was the new English ambassador to France. Even when Queen Mary left France after she was widowed on 1 January 1515, Mary remained behind at the court of Louis' son-in-law and daughter, FrancisI and Claude.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} media {{discussion}} in April 2006 suggesting that Diana was a faithful seat belt user {{and therefore the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both <b>her</b> and Dodi's seat belts either failed or were not used was sinister and might suggest sabotage. Other sources question if she did in fact use her seat belt all the time, as was suggested.|$|R
6000|$|... "Iss, sur; we do {{feel proud}} of it," [...] said the good-looking motherly dame in charge, {{with a little}} twitch of her shoulders, which {{revealed}} the horrible <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both <b>her</b> arms had been taken off above the elbows, [...] "the child'n are very good, and they do sing bootiful. Now then, let the gentlemen hear you--`O that'll be'--come." ...|$|R
2500|$|Part of her prowess {{is due to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{she started}} <b>her</b> career as a rapper. She has a solo album in which she is mainly rapping, {{entitled}} [...] "Urban Therapy".|$|R
25|$|Roluo later {{defeated}} Athislus {{and gave}} Sweden to {{young man named}} Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who also married Roluo's sister Skulde. Skulde, however, {{did not like the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband had to pay taxes to Roluo and so incited Hiartuar to rebel against him. They so went to Lejre (a town which Roluo had built) with arms hidden in the ships, under the pretense that they wanted to pay tribute.|$|E
25|$|Isabella left Mantua for Rome in 1527. She {{was present}} during the catastrophic Sack of Rome, when she {{converted}} her house into an asylum for about 2000 people fleeing the Imperial soldiers. Isabella's house {{was one of}} the very few which was not attacked, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son was a member of the invading army. When she left, she managed to acquire safe passage for all the refugees who had sought refuge in her home.|$|E
25|$|Howe's being a {{published}} author troubled her husband greatly, especially {{due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> poems many times {{had to do with}} critiques of women’s roles as wives, her own marriage, and women’s place in society. Their marriage problems escalated {{to the point where they}} separated in 1852. Samuel, when he became her husband, had also taken complete control of her estate income. Upon her husband’s death in 1876, she had found that through a series of bad investments, most of her money had been spent.|$|E
60|$|She assented as carelessly. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she and <b>her</b> lover were to go, {{with their}} meeting legalized and blessed, {{excluded}} all other considerations. The two young people turned to each other.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} with the {{slightest}} nod. A maid was already awaiting her {{at the door of}} the compartment. Hamel was suddenly conscious of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he disliked <b>her</b> going immensely.|$|R
50|$|In China, {{sometimes}} he {{is seen as}} a respectable cartoon character/figure by older generations because of his faithfulness to his wife despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he fears <b>her</b> and also the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he has not given up yet on catching goats.|$|R
25|$|Soolin, {{played by}} Glynis Barber (series 4). Soolin {{is an expert}} gunfighter, {{distinctive}} for her apparent lack of fear or self-doubt, perhaps developed {{in response to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> parents were murdered when she was a child. She joins the group after she is betrayed by Dorian, her partner. No-one can match her speed at drawing a gun. Soolin's logical and cynical attitude proves an asset to her colleagues. On several occasions, her quick thinking and poignant actions save the crew from perishing, overpowering the Cancer Assassin and surviving the Betafarl Conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Xu Shu {{was in a}} hurry when he sped off on horseback. On the way, he {{suddenly}} remembered something and immediately turned back to meet Liu Bei and recommend Zhuge Liang to him. He then resumed his journey to Xu. When he arrived at his destination, he was shocked to discover that he had been tricked. His mother was furious with her son's failure to discern between truth and deception, and ashamed by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son joined Cao Cao instead of Liu Bei. She committed suicide. Xu Shu remained with Cao Cao, but he swore never to give advice to Cao.|$|E
25|$|The first {{collection}} of Pooh stories {{appeared in the}} book Winnie-the-Pooh. The Evening News Christmas story reappeared as {{the first chapter of}} the book. At the beginning, it explained that Pooh was in fact Christopher Robin's Edward Bear, who had been renamed by the boy. He was renamed after a black bear at London Zoo called Winnie who got her name from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> owner had come from Winnipeg, Canada. The book was published in October 1926 by the publisher of Milne's earlier children's work, Methuen, in England, and E. P. Dutton in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Believing {{the faint}} voice to be <b>that</b> of <b>her</b> father, Bell's {{daughter}} Mrs. Gilbert Grosvenor remarked: [...] "That {{is just the}} sort of thing father would have said. He was always quoting from the classics." [...] The voice was later identified by Tainter as in <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> of <b>her</b> paternal grandfather, Alexander Melville Bell. The historic recording, not heard since 1937, was played again in 2013 and made available online.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) invites Jake to {{the prom}} despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he stood <b>her</b> up two years earlier. The attend {{together}} and they {{are starting to get}} closer again.|$|R
50|$|She is {{the most}} popular girl in school. Used to getting her way, she doesn't like the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Baek Ma-ri has {{captured}} Jung Jae-min's attention. She resorts to bullying Ma-ri and hiding <b>that</b> <b>fact</b> behind <b>her</b> sweet demeanor.|$|R
