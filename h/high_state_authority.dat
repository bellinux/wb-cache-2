40|$|While {{economists have}} taken {{interest}} {{in the relationship between}} market and introduction of technological innovation, our long-term analysis starts from a political-institutional approach because we aim above all to map the decision-making process. In other words, on one hand counting exclusively on the <b>higher</b> <b>state</b> <b>authorities,</b> namely Heads of State or Government, Cabinets and Ministers, {{and on the other hand}} disregarding the role of other centres of decision making at national level as well as at the transnational one, History of International Relations as well as History of European Integration could risk, in our opinion, to lose a meaningful part of their explanatory capabilities. Such decision-making centres are only apparently peripheric. In my researches, they have acquired more and more relevance, and especially since the second half of the 1960 s. Following Tornado project, Airbus has given us the opportunity to deal with the interconnection of different "players" in the context of European construction and to revise our analysis that reinforced its validity anyway. Our research on aircraft cooperation in Europe suggests three points for developing an analysis on technological innovation as an atout of Trans-Atlantic and Intra-European competition / cooperation in aircraft production: 1 °) first of all, the re-consideration of the role played in Foreign policy making process by governments, by <b>higher</b> <b>state</b> <b>authorities</b> engaged particularly in the "poussée technologique", i. e. in that specific process where only engineers would be able to understand the originality and the technical potentialities of their "inventions" but, anyway, without defining completely all their commercial consequences.

In 1918, Pavelić entered the party leadership and its Business Committee. After the unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the Kingdom of Serbia on 1 December 1918, the Party of Rights held a day of public protest claiming that the Croatian people were against having a Serbian king, and that their <b>highest</b> <b>state</b> <b>authorities</b> had not agreed to unification. Further, the party expressed their wish for Croatian republic in a program from March 1919, signed by president of the party, Vladimir Prebeg and Pavelić. By 1921 Pavelić was an elected city official in Zagreb and became a major influence on younger members. At the time he was the party secretary, and as a leader of the party he began to advocate Croatian independence.|$|R

40|$|Mevlânâ Celâleddin Rumî, a thirteenth-century Sufi leader, is an {{important}} religious figure in the Islamic-Sufi tradition. He {{is regarded as the}} founder of the Mevlevi Order. On the other hand, Sufism has been officially banned in the Turkish Republic since 1925, which includes all Sufi lodges, and the Mevlevî order is no exception. Although the public visibility of Sufi practices had been illegal and Sufism had lost its legitimacy in modern Turkey, the Turkish State established and recognized commemorations in honour of Mevlânâ approximately two decades after launching the secular reforms banning Sufism. Today these ceremonies are held annually and attended regularly by the <b>highest</b> <b>state</b> <b>authorities.</b> The first commemoration was held in Konya in December 1942 {{on the occasion of the}} 670 th anniversary of Mevlânâ’s death where Mevlânâ was presented as ‘the great thinker of Anatolia’. This paper examines the intellectual and discursive context that helped legitimize the commemoration of a religious figure. Drawing on Michel Foucault and Edward Said’s theoretical insights, it analyses the cultural-intellectual debates and framings of Mevlânâ by the traditionalists, humanists, and nationalists thinkers, expressed in the speeches given at the first commemoration in 1942. Analysis suggests that epistemological shifts behind different conceptions of Mevlânâ have given way to a hybrid narrative...|$|R
40|$|Hungarian higher {{education}} underwent {{a number of}} reforms during the last century and in 2004 it is again being transformed. In {{order to understand the}} extent of the changes, and the specific meaning of certain concepts that emerge in relation to this process, it is important to look back on the beginning of the last century, when a major re-structuring of the system of {{higher education}} took place. In explaining the changes, it is also necessary to keep in mind the special dynamics of these events. While political power, on the one hand, influences the organisation of administration and the content of curricula with the intention of bringing about fast and thorough changes, actual modifications of institutional structures are always slower to follow. At the beginning of the 20 th century {{there were a number of}} problematic issues relating to university education, one of them concerning the question of academic freedom. The autonomy of universities at the time was relatively limited in terms of personal, educational and economic questions, and it was restricted to the internal organisation only, which was rather bureaucratic and slow.

50|$|Despite all the {{activities}} related {{to the construction of}} buildings intended for postal services, the building of the Main Post Office was not constructed until the beginning of the fourth decade of the twentieth century. An all-Yugoslav competition for the project of the Palace of the Post Office Savings Bank and the Main Post Office and Telegraph was announced in Belgrade in 1930. From a total of fifteen of submitted works, whose authors were architects from all over the country, {{as well as those who}} were in training or working abroad, in September 1930, three papers and four purchases were selected and awarded. First prize was awarded to the joint project of Zagreb architects Јosip Pičman and Аndrija Baranji, designed according to the principles of modern architecture, while the second prize was awarded to the also modern project of Slovenian architect Аco Lovrenčić. However, the realization of the winning project was soon abandoned. The beginning of the thirties of the last century was marked by the economic crisis in the European context, while the second reason lay in the discontent of the <b>highest</b> <b>state</b> <b>authorities</b> by the selected project of architect Pičman, which in their opinion did not satisfy the requirements for representative and monumental architecture of public buildings. The reduction and ease of the facade canvas of Pičman’s project did not fit the dominant architectural concept, which included the architecture of public buildings expressing the power, prosperity and statehood of the young Yugoslav Kingdom through its gorgeous, academically shaped facades. Immediately after the competition, at the end of 1930, it was decided that the Ministry of Construction amend the winning project. Elaboration of the sketches was entrusted to the architect Dimitrije M. Leko, and within the ministry, a narrower internal competition was organized to create new plans for the façades of the building, where the project of the architect Vasilije Androsov was evaluated as the best one. However, after the adoption of the new project of architect Androsov, the construction of the building did not start until another almost five years. Having approved the construction in 1934, on 17 August 1935, the ceremony of consecration of the foundation stone took place. The work on the realization of this very important facility for the then Belgrade environment lasted three years and ended on 10 October 1938.|$|R
