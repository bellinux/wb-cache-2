The Lennard‐Jones 28 – 7 potential gives the least satisfactory results. The Lennard‐Jones 12 – 6 potential works satisfactorily for the monatomic gases and CH_ 4 but poorly for the rodlike molecules C_ 2 H_ 6, CO_ 2, N_ 2, O_ 2, C_ 2 H_ 4. This failure {{may be due to}} (i) distortions of the hydrate lattice, (ii) neglect of molecular shape and size in determining the cavity potential (iii) barrier to internal rotation of the molecule in its cavity. A crude model for the lattice shows that it is not distorted. The Kihara potential predicts better <b>dissociation</b> <b>pressures</b> for the hydrates of the rodlike molecules. Unlike the previously used Lennard‐Jones 12 – 6 potential, it depends on {{the size and shape of}} the interacting molecules. The absence of lattice distortions, improved <b>dissociation</b> <b>pressures</b> through the use of the Kihara potential and the restriction of the motion of the solute molecule to around the center of a cavity makes a large barrier to rotation unlikely.

5000|$|The first {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} CO2 hydrates dates back to the year 1882, when Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski reported clathrate formation while studying carbonic acid. He noted that gas hydrate was a white material resembling snow, and could be formed by raising the pressure above a certain limit in his H2O - CO2 system. He was the first to estimate the CO2 hydrate composition, finding it to be approximately CO2•8H2O. He also mentions that [...] "...the hydrate is only formed either {{on the walls of the}} tube, where the water layer is extremely thin or on the free water surface... (from French)" [...] This already indicates the importance of the surface available for reaction (i.e. the larger the surface the better). Later on, in 1894, M. P. Villard deduced the hydrate composition as CO2•6H2O. Three years later, he published the hydrate dissociation curve in the range 267 K to 283 K. Tamman & Krige measured the hydrate decomposition curve from 253 K down to 230 K in 1925 and Frost & Deaton (1946) determined the <b>dissociation</b> <b>pressure</b> between 273 and 283 K. Takenouchi & Kennedy (1965) measured the decomposition curve from 45 bars up to 2 kbar (4.5 to 200 MPa).

The hydrate dissociation process consists of two periods: the depressurizing period and the steady-pressure period: In the depressurizing period, the hydrate dissociation occurs in the whole reactor. The cumulative gas production is similar, and the gas production rate is affected by the depressurization rate and the water production in this period. The cumulative water production increases With the decrease of the hydrate saturation in the whole depressurization process. In the steady-pressure period, the cumulative gas production increases with the increase of the hydrate saturation. The average gas production rate first increases with the increase of the hydrate saturation and then decreases at hydrate saturation of 43. 2 %. The water production during the steady-pressure period only occurs in the experiments with the high hydrate saturation.
