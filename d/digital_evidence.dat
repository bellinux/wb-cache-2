It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms.

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} <b>digital</b> <b>evidence</b> are {{concerned}} with two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Digital</b> <b>evidences</b> hold great {{significance}} for governing cybercrime. Unfor-tunately, previous acquisition tools were troubled {{by either the}} shortage of suspending the target system’s running or {{the security of the}} acquisition tools themselves, thus the correctness and accuracy of their obtained evidences cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose VAIL, a novel virtualization based monitoring system for mini-intrusive live forensics, which employs hardware assisted virtualization technique to gather integrated information from the native computer system. Meanwhile, the exe-cution of the target system will not be interrupted and VAIL keeps immune to attacks from the target system. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that has been validated with a Windows guest system. The experimental results show that VAIL can obtain comprehensive <b>digital</b> <b>evidences</b> from the target system as designed, including the CPU state, the physical memory content, and the I/O activities. And on average, VAIL only introduces 4. 21 % performance overhead to the target system, which proves that VAIL is practical in real commercial environments...|$|R

Provenance metadata accompany these forensic data to answer questions about the origin of these data and build trustworthy between role players and juries in order to make the tangible CoCs admissible in the court of law.

50|$|Many {{courts in}} the United States have applied the Federal Rules of Evidence to <b>digital</b> <b>evidence</b> {{in a similar way}} to {{traditional}} documents, although important differences such as the lack of established standards and procedures have been noted. In addition, <b>digital</b> <b>evidence</b> tends to be more voluminous, more difficult to destroy, easily modified, easily duplicated, potentially more expressive, and more readily available. As such, some courts have sometimes treated <b>digital</b> <b>evidence</b> differently for purposes of authentication, hearsay, the best evidence rule, and privilege. In December 2006, strict new rules were enacted within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requiring the preservation and disclosure of electronically stored evidence. <b>Digital</b> <b>evidence</b> is often attacked for its authenticity due to the ease with which it can be modified, although courts are beginning to reject this argument without proof of tampering.|$|E

Examples of <b>digital</b> <b>evidence</b> are: incriminating e-mails, log traces to find whereabouts, web cameras, pictures or videos stored in a computer.
