50|$|Gaseous fire {{suppression}} {{is a term}} to describe the use of inert gases and chemical agents to extinguish a fire. Also called clean agent {{fire suppression}}.

Less typically, the agent may be delivered by means of solid propellant gas generators that produce either inert or chemically active gas.|$|E

50|$|Alternatives to Halon 1301 in <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> {{are being}} deployed. Many {{installations}} from which halon is removed can be protected with fire sprinklers, {{depending on the}} level of damage the equipment in the space will incur by exposure to water. In other cases, different total flooding agents can be used. The alternatives for normally occupied areas include (PFC-410 or CEA-410), C3F8 (PFC-218 or CEA-308), HCFC Blend A (NAF S-III), HFC-23 (FE 13), HFC-227ea (FM 200), IG-01 (argon), IG-55 (argonite), HFC-125, or HFC-134a. For normally unoccupied areas, the alternatives include carbon dioxide, powdered Aerosol C, CF3I, HCFC-22, HCFC-124, HFC-125, HFC-134a, gelled halocarbon/dry chemical suspension (PGA), blend of inert gas, high expansion foam systems and powdered aerosol (FS 0140), and IG-541 (Inergen).Perfluorocarbons, i.e., PFCs such as C3F8, have very long atmospheric lifetimes and very high global warming potentials. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, i.e., HCFCs including HCFC containing NAF S-III, contain chlorine and are stratospheric ozone layer depleters, although less so than Halon 1301. Their selection for usage as Halon replacements should consider those factors, and is restricted in some countries.|$|E
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis {{about the}} Possibility of usage fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> for extinguishing fires I was mainly {{interested in the}} topic of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> and their usage {{and also in the}} problematics of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> installed and used in the SYNTHOS Kralupy a. s., SYNTHOS PBR s. r. o. and TAMERO INVEST s. r. o. (companies) For this purpose, four fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> were chosen based on the used fire extinguishing agent. According to these criteria were chosen water, foam, powder and gas based fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems,</b> which are described in the thesis with regard to their construction, operation and usage. Chosen fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> were further evaluated regarding their capabilities for extinguishing fire. According to the conducted research current options for fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> are used. Even though current options of usage fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> are used it is possible to improve the usage of them by introducing technical and organizational measures. As a crucial technical measure, there is proposed a technical adjustment of the water based fixed fire extinguishing system. For improving the usage of this fixed fire extinguishing system and increasing the level of fire safety of the guarded object it is proposed to change this non-automatic fixed fire extinguishing system to automatic. Other devices are automatic and the proposed improvements do not have such underlying character as it in case of the evaluated water based fixed fire extinguishing system. In the theoretical part of the thesis there are described terms like fire, burning and conflagration (fire). There are named conditions and possibilities for the origin of fire and its spreading and is described the spreading of conflagration in time and space. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis is concerned about named fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems.</b> There is the history of their use for fighting fire, the overview of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> based on the used agent and the description on the different kinds of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> along with the description of the possibilities of their use for fighting fire. In the theoretical part are also mentioned new technologies used in the field of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems.</b> The conclusion of the thesis is focused on the problematics of operation and operational capability of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E
