500|$|A typical {{example is}} Pound's [...] "In a Station of the Metro" [...] (1913), {{inspired}} by an {{experience on the}} Paris Underground, about which he wrote, [...] "I got out of a train at, I think, La Concorde, and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> words for what this made me feel." [...] He worked on the poem for a year, reducing it to its essence {{in the style of}} a Japanese haiku.|$|E
500|$|The Archbishop of Ohrid, Atanasije, {{after his}} {{movement}} had largely failed in Albania, {{was now in}} Rome. [...] The Serb uprising had no better luck; the Herzegovinian tribes, Drobnjaci, Nikšić and Piva began fighting, but were defeated at the field of Gacko (Gatačko Polje) by Dervish Bey sometime in 1597. According to the Venetian Lazzaro Soranzo (1599), the Piperi, Kuči, Klimenti, Bjelopavlići and others tried to liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny, and upon hearing the false claim that Sultan Mehmed III lost the battle and his life at the Siege of Eger, [...] "they all rose up {{under the command of}} vojvoda Grdan and there was a great slaughter of Turks who were on their land. As <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out more, I heard the contrary, that they unhappily withdrew into their mountains"; Montenegrin historian Gligor Stanojević, based on Soranzo's account, which he described as [...] "the most interesting and most contradicting note on the movement of the Brda and Herzegovina tribes in this time", believed that the rebellion did not have the scale of a national uprising.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} I ask myself one basic question: "How came to, that from {{infantile}} plays I reached the acting in theater?" I follow the progress in playing games and in playing itself from childhood along puberty to full age. I compare two parallel progresses.
