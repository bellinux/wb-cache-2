5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> going on, {{remaining}} {{unaffected by the}} changes in the timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E

60|$|Such miffs {{about her}} little sister were in {{the natural order of}} things, and really it was the 'all pervadingness,' as she called it in her own mind, of Aunt Jane that chiefly worried her, the way that the little lady knew <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> done, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> touched in the house; but as long as Valetta took refuge with herself, and grumbled to her, it was bearable.|$|R

25|$|However, the {{structure}} of the history itself is sound, as most things are added with an eye to how they fit in with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> already known. As a result, the SFU has a history that covers (in various products) a span of about 130 years. Thanks to Steve Cole being the guiding influence from start to finish, the SFU has far fewer inconsistencies than the canon Star Trek universe.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Romani were herded into {{so called}} ghettos, {{including}} the Warsaw Ghetto (April–June 1942), where {{they formed a}} distinct class {{in relation to the}} Jews.

25|$|The apostolate of the Sodalitium is {{universal}} {{and its members}} participate in the evangelizing mission of the Church, spreading the Gospel to <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not in accordance with it.

This does not preclude other areas of apostolate that also are {{carried out in the}} spiritual family of the Sodalitium, especially in the family, the defense of life and education.|$|E

25|$|The jetty {{received}} {{renewed interest}} with antique bottle collectors {{in the late}} 1960s as the ocean floor surrounding the jetty was covered with soda and beer bottles. Bottle collectors had frequently visited the site since its use was discontinued, but it was noticed that storms would reveal new materials from under the sea bed. The remains of the site were frequently visited by Scuba divers for recreation or bottle collecting. The site is pockmarked by holes dug by these collectors. These collectors had removed almost <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> deemed attractive material leaving only broken pieces scattered across the site.|$|E

As such, he would have been from the Newa people and a Buddhist. However, it is known that Arniko lived in Kathmandu Valley during the reign of Jaya Bhim Dev Malla, the successor of Abhaya Malla.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E
