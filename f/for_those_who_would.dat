25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> believe, so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned {{as it would be}} unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E

The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items.
