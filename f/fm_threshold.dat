40|$|Adults show great {{variation}} in their auditory skills, {{such as being}} able to discriminate between foreign speech-sounds. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} structural features of auditory cortex can predict auditory abilities; here we are interested in the maturation of 2 -Hz frequency-modulation (FM) detection, a task thought to tap into mechanisms underlying language abilities. We hypothesized that an individual's <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> will correlate with gray-matter density in left Heschl's gyrus, and that this function-structure relationship will change through adolescence. To test this hypothesis, we collected anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data from participants who were tested and scanned at three time points: at 10, 11. 5 and 13 years of age. Participants judged which of two tones contained FM; the modulation depth was adjusted using an adaptive staircase procedure and their threshold was calculated based on the geometric mean of the last eight reversals. Using voxel-based morphometry, we found that <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> was significantly correlated with gray-matter density in left Heschl's gyrus at the age of 10 years, but that this correlation weakened with age. While there were no differences between girls and boys at Times 1 and 2, at Time 3 there was a relationship between gray-matter density in left Heschl's gyrus in boys but not in girls. Taken together, our results confirm that the structure of the auditory cortex can predict temporal processing abilities, namely that gray-matter density in left Heschl's gyrus can predict 2 -Hz FM detection threshold. This ability is dependent on the processing of sounds changing over time, a skill believed necessary for speech processing. We tested this assumption and found that <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> significantly correlated with spelling abilities at Time 1, but that this correlation was found only in boys. This correlation decreased at Time 2, and at Time 3 we found a significant correlation between reading and <b>FM</b> <b>threshold,</b> but again, only in boys. We examined the sex differences in both the imaging and behavioral data taking into account pubertal stages, and found that the correlation between <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> and spelling was strongest pre-pubertally, and the correlation between <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> and gray-matter density in left Heschl's gyrus was strongest mid-pubertally...|$|E

Thresholds were estimated for detecting a brief backward-masked tone (BM), detection of frequency modulation (FM), and pitch discrimination using temporal cues (deltaf 0). Both BM and <b>FM</b> <b>thresholds</b> improved with training, and by the 2 nd test session, <b>FM</b> <b>thresholds</b> were in the adult range. There were marked individual differences on BM and deltaf 0 and, for both tasks, performance correlated with Tallal's Auditory Repetition Task administered 2 years previously. However, no auditory measure gave significant differences between LI and control groups; performance was influenced more by nonverbal than language ability. Some children did have a stable pattern of poor performance on certain auditory tasks, but their good FM detection raised questions about whether processing of auditory temporal information is abnormal.

40|$|In energy-constrained {{applications}} like Body Area Networks (BAN) receiver {{performance is}} traded for lower power consumption. The limited receiver performance will deteriorate the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) of the receiver. In this paper we present closed-form output SNR and BER models of a non-ideal receiver front-end with limiter-discriminator demodulator for binary FSK. The presented model is very useful {{in defining the}} minimally required receiver specifications. Moreover, the models are useful for gaining insight into the influences of the receiver impairments on its performance. In the models, the gain and phase imbalances between the in-phase and quadrature-phase paths {{as well as the}} receiver generated noise and the phase noise produced by the local frequency reference are taken into account. This paper shows that the gain and phase imbalances shift the <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> to higher carrier-to-noise-ratios (CNR) and only have small influence on the SNR above threshold. On the other hand, receiver generated noise reduces the output SNR both below and above the <b>FM</b> <b>threshold,</b> and phase noise limits the maximum output SNR. Additionally, a trade-off between the FSK frequency deviation and phase noise robustness is derived...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program is developed {{to calculate the}} <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> impulse rates {{as a function of}} the carrier-to-noise ratio for a specified FM system. The system parameters and a vector of 1024 integers, representing the probability density of the modulating voltage, are required as input parameters. The {{computer program}} is utilized to calculate threshold impulse rates for twenty-four sets of measured probability data supplied by NASA and for sinusoidal and Gaussian modulating waveforms. As a result of the analysis several conclusions are drawn: (1) The use of preemphasis in an FM television system improves the threshold by reducing the impulse rate. (2) Sinusoidal modulation produces a total impulse rate which is a practical upper bound for the impulse rates of TV signals providing the same peak deviations. (3) As the moment of the FM spectrum about the center frequency of the predetection filter increases, the impulse rate tends to increase. (4) A spectrum having an expected frequency above (below) the center frequency of the predetection filter produces a higher negative (positive) than positive (negative) impulse rate...|$|E
40|$|Halftoning is {{a crucial}} part of image {{reproduction}} in print. First-order FM halftones, in which the single dots are stochastically distributed, is widely used in printing technologies, such as inkjet, that are able to stably print isolated dispersed dots. Printers, such as laser printers, that utilize electrophotographic technology are not able to stably print the isolated dots and therefore use clustered-dot halftones. Periodic clustered-dot, i. e. AM, halftones are commonly used in this type of printers but they suffer from undesired periodic interference pattern called moiré. An alternative solution is to use second-order FM halftones in which the clustered dots are stochastically distributed. The iterative halftoning techniques, that usually result in well-formed halftones, are operating on the whole input image and require extensive computations and thereby are very slow when the input image is large. In this paper, we introduce a method to generate image independent threshold matrices for first and second-order FM halftoning. The first-order threshold matrix generates well-formed halftone patterns and the second-order <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> matrix can be adjusted to produce clustered-dots of different size, shape and alignment. Using predetermined and image independent threshold matrices makes the proposed halftoning method a point-by-point process and thereby very fast...|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{processing}} and {{spoken word recognition}} difficulties have been observed in Specific Language Impairment (SLI), raising the possibility that auditory perceptual deficits disrupt word recognition and, in turn, phonological {{processing and}} oral language. In this study, fifty-seven kindergarten children with SLI and fifty-three language typical age-matched controls were assessed with a speech-gating task to measure spoken word recognition, psychophysical tasks to measure auditory Frequency Modulation (FM) detection and Frequency Discrimination (FD), and standardized psychometric tests of phonological processing and oral language. As a group, children with SLI took significantly longer than language-typical controls to recognize words with high neighborhood density, perhaps reflecting subpar phonological representations. FM, but not FD, was significantly worse in SLI. However, while both poorer speech-gating performance and poorer auditory <b>thresholds</b> (<b>FM)</b> were evident in SLI, spoken word recognition did not mediate any relation between auditory perception and either phonological processing or oral language...|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{experience}} during early development can shape {{the central nervous}} system and this is thought to influence adult perceptual skills. In the auditory system, early induction of conductive hearing loss (CHL) leads to deficits in central auditory coding properties in adult animals, and this is accompanied by diminished perceptual thresholds. In contrast, a brief regimen of auditory training during development can enhance the perceptual skills of animals when tested in adulthood. Here, we asked whether a brief period of training during development could compensate for the perceptual deficits displayed by adult animals reared with CHL. Juvenile gerbils with CHL, and age-matched controls, were trained on a frequency modulation (FM) detection task for 4 or 10 days. The performance of each group was subsequently assessed in adulthood, and compared to adults with normal hearing or adults raised with CHL that did not receive juvenile training. We show that as juveniles, both CHL and NH animals display similar <b>FM</b> detection <b>thresholds</b> that are not immediately impacted by the perceptual training. However, as adults, detection thresholds and psychometric function slopes of these animals were significantly improved. Importantly, CHL adults with juvenile training displayed thresholds that approached normal hearing adults. Additionally, we found that hearing impaired animals trained for 10 days displayed adult thresholds closer to untrained adults than those trained for 4 days. Thus, a relatively brief period of auditory training may compensate for the deleterious impact of hearing deprivation on auditory perception on the trained task...|$|R
40|$|The design, development, and {{analysis}} are reported of a digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) for <b>FM</b> demodulation and <b>threshold</b> extension. One {{of the features}} of the developed DPLL is its synchronous, real time operation. The sampling frequency is constant and all the required arithmetic and logic operations are performed within one sampling period, generating an output sequence which is converted to analog form and filtered. An equation relating the sampling frequency to the carrier frequency must be satisfied to guarantee proper DPLL operation. The synchronous operation enables a time-shared operation of one DPLL to demodulate several FM signals simultaneously. In order to obtain information about the DPLL performance at low input signal-to-noise ratios, a model of an input noise spike was introduced, and the DPLL equation was solved using a digital computer. The spike model was successful in finding a second order DPLL which yielded a five db threshold extension beyond that of a first order DPLL...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the design, analysis, {{simulation}} and implementation of new improved architectures of the Time Delay Digital Tanlock Loop (TDTL) based digital phase-locked loop (DPLL). The proposed architectures overcome some fundamental limitations exhibited by the original TDTL. These limitations include the presence of nonlinearity in the phase detector (PD), the non-zero phase error of the first-order loop, the restricted locking range, particularly of the second-order loop, the limited acquisition speed and the noise performance. Two approaches were adopted in this work to alleviate these limitations: the first involved modifying the original TDTL through the incorporation of auxiliary circuit blocks that enhance its performance, whilst the second involved designing new tanlock-based architectures. The proposed architectures, which resulted from the above approaches, were tested under various input signal conditions and their performance was compared with the original TDTL. The proposed architectures demonstrated an improvement of up to fourfold in terms of the acquisition times, twofold in noise performance and a marked enhancement in the linearity and in the locking range. The effectiveness of the proposed tanlock-based architectures was also assessed and demonstrated by using them in various applications, which included FM demodulation, <b>FM</b> <b>threshold</b> extension, FM demodulation with improved THD (total harmonic distortion), and Doppler effect improvement. The results from these applications showed that the performance of the new architectures outperformed the original TDTL. Real-time performance of these architectures was evaluated through implementation of some of them on an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) based system. Practical results from the prototype FPGA based implementations confirmed the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink. ...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{dyslexia}} {{is characterized}} by a phonological processing deficit and impaired low-level auditory processing may contribute to this problem. However, this remains controversial because not all dyslexic individuals show psychophysical deficits on auditory processing tasks; hence {{it has been argued that}} auditory processing deficits are not a causal factor in dyslexia. Because behavioral psychophysical tasks include both bottom-up processing and top-down strategies, dyslexics' successful coping strategies may positively influence their performance on auditory behavioral measures. Therefore we have studied whether dyslexics who perform adequately on auditory psychophysical tasks nevertheless show electrophysiological evidence of impaired auditory processing. We compared auditory event-related mismatch negativity (MMN) potentials to frequency modulated (FM) tones at 5, 20 and 240 Hz between dyslexic adults and controls. Groups were matched for age, cognitive ability and psychophysical <b>FM</b> detection <b>thresholds.</b> The dyslexic group showed significantly smaller MMNs in the 20 Hz FM condition in both the early (150 - 300 ms, P = 0. 010) and late (300 - 500 ms, P = 0. 049) time frames. A 2 -way ANOVA showed a significant group by FM rate interaction (P = 0. 012). There were no significant differences between the groups in the 5 Hz or 240 Hz conditions. The magnitude of the 20 Hz FM MMN correlated with the degree of discrepancy between cognitive and literacy skills (0. 66, P = 0. 003) in the entire group. Thus, even among compensated dyslexics with above-average cognitive abilities and adequate performance on auditory psychophysical tasks, the MMN responses of some dyslexic adults were found to be abnormal.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} corneal {{sensitivity to}} selective mechanical, chemical, heat, and cold stimulation {{in patients with}} fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS. Twenty patients with FM (18 women, 2 men; 51. 9 ± 2. 3 years old) and 18 control subjects (16 women, 2 men; 51. 7 ± 2. 4 years) participated voluntarily in the study. Subjective symptoms of ocular dryness were explored and a Schirmer I test was performed. The response to selective stimulation of the central cornea with the Belmonte gas esthesiometer was measured. RESULTS. The majority (18 / 20) of patients with FM reported dry eye symptoms, with the ocular dryness score significantly higher in affected subjects than in healthy ones (2. 3 ± 0. 1 vs. 0. 05 ± 0. 02; P < 0. 001). The Schirmer test results were significantly lower in patients with FM than in those {{in the control group}} (10. 5 ± 2. 2 and 30. 6 ± 1. 6 mm, respectively; P < 0. 001). Mean corneal threshold sensitivity values to chemical stimulation (31. 16 % ± 2. 04 % CO 2 FM; 15. 72 %± 0. 67 % CO 2 control), heat (1. 87 ± 0. 11 °C FM; 0. 99 ± 0. 05 °C control), and cold (± 2. 53 ± 0. 11 °C FM; ± 0. 76 ± 0. 05 °C control) were increased in patients with <b>FM,</b> whereas <b>threshold</b> responses to mechanical stimulation did not vary significantly (123. 0 ± 8. 0 mL/min FM; 107. 8 ± 4. 4 mL/min control). CONCLUSIONS. The reduced corneal sensitivity of patients with fibromyalgia is attributable to a moderate decrease in corneal polymodal and cold nociceptor sensitivity, which may be the consequence or the cause of the chronic reduction in tear secretion also observed in these patients. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

One potential factor, central pain sensitization, was quantified {{here as the}} response to the temporal summation (TS) paradigm, and that response was compared between case and control groups. Objectives: As previous research has shown that fibromyalgia (FM) is diagnosed in ~ 20 % of TMD patients, Aim 1 determined whether central sensitization is found preferentially in myofascial TMD cases that have orofacial pain as a regional manifestation of FM. Aim 2 determined if the report of after-sensations (AS) following TS varied depending on whether repeated stimuli were rated as increasingly painful. Methods: One hundred sixty-eight women, 43 controls, 100 myofascial TMD-only cases, and 25 myofascial TMD + FM cases, were compared on thermal warmth and pain thresholds, thermal TS, and decay of thermal AS. All cases met Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD; comorbid cases also met the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for <b>FM.</b> Results: Pain <b>thresholds</b> and TS were similar in all groups. When TS was achieved (~ 60 %), significantly higher levels of AS were reported in the first poststimulus interval, and AS decayed more slowly over time, in myofascial TMD cases than controls. By contrast, groups showed similar AS decay patterns following steady state or decreasing responses to repetitive stimulation. Conclusion: In this case–control study, all myofascial TMD cases were characterized by a similar delay in the decay of AS. Thus, this indicator of central sensitization failed to suggest different pain maintenance factors in myofascial TMD cases with and without FM.
