The teacher–learner exchanges were categorized as being primarily focused on content, communication, management, or explicit language.

Teachers were most likely to provide feedback <b>in</b> <b>exchanges</b> that were focused on explicit language and content; learners were most likely to use feedback provided <b>in</b> explicit language-focused <b>exchanges.</b> Feedback was seldom used <b>in</b> content <b>exchanges</b> and never <b>in</b> management contexts.
