3000|$|Pharmacokinetic {{characteristics}} of STS-Nano-RBCs {{were conducted in}} adult SD rats. 12 SD rats were divided into 2 groups, and test samples were intravenously injected through rat tail vein with the dose of 5  mg/kg; the concentration of STS-Nano-RBC and STS was 1.1  mg/ml. At each time points, the blood was collected and centrifuged (2000  rpm for 10  min) to separate the plasma. After that, 50  μl <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> (1  μg/ml) and 1  ml acetonitrile were added into plasma to extract STS. The mixture was vortex-mixed for 1  min followed by centrifugation at 10000  rpm for 10  min. The supernatant was evaporated under nitrogen atmosphere condition and was redissolved with 200  μl mobile phase before HPLC assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentrations of STS with DAS 2.0 software system. The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were maximum plasma concentration (C [...]...|$|E
40|$|Some a, w—diphenoxyalkane p, p'-dicarboxylic acids (1) were {{prepared}} by the reaction of p-hydroxybenzoic acid with a, w—dihaloalkane {{in the presence of}} NaOH in dimethyl sulfoxide con-taining considerable amounts of water. This method is adaptable to the preparations of a, w—diphenoxyalkane—m, m'—dicarboxylic a ids (2) and a, w—diphenoxyalkane—p, p'—diacetic acids (3). Some aromatic polyethers (4) could be {{prepared by the}} reaction of 4, 4 '—isopropylidenediphenol with a, w—dihaloalkane in the presence of NaOH, in which the dimethyl sulfoxide—water mixture was used {{in the same manner as}} a solvent.

30|$|Based on the {{theoretical}} and empirical backgrounds described above, various wet chemical treatments of rag paper with verdigris were tested, simulating a practical situation that conservators might face in their workshops. The sample paper was a handmade rag paper with gelatin sizing, and the verdigris pigments bound in gum arabic were still partially soluble in water or alcohols. The tested chemicals include alkaline earth carbonates and hydroxide, complexing agents such as calcium phytate and 1 H-benzotriazol, and antioxidants such as tetrabutylammonium bromide and <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate.</b> Mostly, a single chemical treatment was employed {{to focus on the}} effect of each agent, with a few exceptions, such as a two-step calcium phytate/calcium hydrogen carbonate treatment. The stabilization effect of the treatments was evaluated by the GPC-Fluorescence-MALLS system with fluorescence labeling of the oxidative functionality of cellulose after accelerated aging. Using this system, not only absolute molar mass moments determined by MALLS (multi-angle laser light scattering detector), but also the carbonyl group contents measured by a fluorescence detector after a carbonyl specific labeling could be presented. Analysis of selected samples using SEM-EDS was also performed. In this paper, the effect on the molecular structure of cellulose, i.e. molar mass and carbonyl groups, after accelerated aging are discussed to evaluate the stabilization of cellulose after different treatments in the presence of copper ions. Details of visual changes after treatments and after accelerated aging and the aspects of practical application by conservators are introduced elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|The uptake of each {{of eleven}} {{structurally}} related solutes from pH 1 donor solution by an invariant liquid membrane formulation was investigated. The presence of polyamino surfactants in liquid membrane formulation significantly altered the partition of solutes between aqueous phase and oil phase. Benzoic acid and salicylic acid followed monoexponentiai kinetics while the uptake of other solutes followed biexponential processes, except p-aminobenzoic acid which was not transported at all. Both benzoic acid and salicylic acid were removed with a much faster rate compared to other solutes. Approximately, 90 % of these solutes were removed in two and half minutes from the donor solution. It is proposed {{that the presence of}} a phenolic group allowed salicylic acid to be transported with a significantly high rate as it can form intramolecular hydrogen bonding which increases its solubility in non-polar solvents. This is supported by the fact that meta and para-hydroxybenzoic acids were removed at a much slower rate. As expected, p-amino benzoic acid was not transported through liquid membrane from an acidic donor solution probably because of the ionized amino group. In presence of methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate,</b> acetaminophen and salicylamide rupture of the liquid membrane was apparent. This is possibly due to the formation of alcohols in the internal aqueous phase when these esters react with the encapsulated buffer. From the data obtained, it appears that the apparent leakage follows zero order kinetics. A new and more sophisticated kinetic model is proposed in an attempt to rationalize the basic mechanisms behind the solute uptake by the liquid membranes. The data for benzoic acid, salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid were analyzed by this model. Benzoic acid was not fit by this model. The lack of success to fit the data for benzoic acid is probably due to the dimerization of benzoic acid in the liquid membrane. For salicylic acid, which followed monoexponential kinetics, micro-rate constant k 1 is significantly higher than k 2 and k 3 while k 1 is significantly smaller than k 2 and k 3 for acetylsalicylic acid which followed biexponential kinetics. Hence, it is possible that depending en the magnitude of these micro-rate constants the uptake process may follow either mono or biexponential kinetics...|$|E
