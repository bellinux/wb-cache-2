60|$|Don Jer. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> But, I believe, {{you will}} not see a prettier girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "You foolish child!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{believe that}} you have been worrying. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much about other people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> now? Why, {{every one}} has been {{remarking}} to me how pleasant {{it is that the}} rooms are not crowded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you forebore {{to let us}} {{hear the}} ring of {{trumpets}} and the tramp of soldiery in the square. Nor <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> numerous a suite necessary for your dignity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> How {{often have}} I asked {{you for your}} grounds for such a conviction! There are none. The man of the age is clearly the Duke, the saviour of Europe, in the {{perfection}} of manhood, and with an iron constitution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you indeed? I'm {{after all}} very much afraid of <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm <b>so</b> very easily pleased?" [...] she asked suddenly, {{changing}} her tone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> high-minded a {{girl would}} listen to you, and take {{advantage}} of a fancy in a boy so much younger, and of a different class?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Her face flamed with color--all her sullen {{restraint}} vanished, all her girlish charm came back. [...] "Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Do {{you suppose}} I {{could get him}} to teach me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|CAPT. G. (Promptly.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Doesn't it show {{a sort of}} motherly {{interest}} in us? (Aside.) Thank Heaven, Harry always wrapped her meaning up safely! (Aloud.) Is it absolutely necessary {{to go on with}} the letter, darling? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is much better," [...] Maria said approvingly. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have {{improved}} {{since you have}} been away. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Giulia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's the difference! A Berliner {{could do}} it, and a Bostonian couldn't. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> {{much better to}} have the courage of your convictions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I {{see what}} you mean. I should say it had begun of late. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> bad a sign?" [...] she asked anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! {{we shall}} {{have to make a}} portage, then, I presume. Could we not give it one trial more? I think we might make a dash for the tail of that eddy, and then the stream above seems not quite so strong. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Jacques?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{controlled}} her temper. [...] "I {{do indeed}} feel the heat," [...] she admitted, with a resignation which gently reproved him; [...] "it is so heavy and oppressive here after Brighton. Perhaps my sad life, {{far away from}} home and friends, makes me sensitive to trifles. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Morris?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Major?" [...] Lord Haverley asked. [...] "The general {{opinion is}} that your record is better {{than that of the}} Phantom. She has done well in the two or three races she has sailed, but she {{certainly}} did not beat the Lesbia or the Mermaid by as much as you did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clarence is handsome, but worthless," [...] she {{continued}} in her sprightly way. [...] "I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she's <b>so</b> very pretty, Mr. Hopper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's--something I don't {{want you}} to let Lottie know I've got. She tells that Mr. Trannel everything, and then {{he wants to make}} fun. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>so</b> very witty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed! Yes, you're quite right. I {{assure you}} I can't {{sleep at night}} for {{thinking}} of you, Mr. Legge. It's the best a Christian can <b>do,</b> seeing <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> mightly little of yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{replied the}} Colonel, drily; [...] "the remark is sound and applies to most things. At present, however, I {{think that she}} is worse; also I hate {{the sight of her}} fat red face. But bother the cook, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much about her; I have {{something}} else to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am {{not worth}} {{receiving}} further proof even of Heaven's reprobation. Do you think, Thomasin, {{that she knew}} me--that she did not die in that horrid mistaken notion about my not forgiving her, which I can't tell you how she acquired? If you could only assure me of that! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Eustacia? Do speak to me." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [dubiously]. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> No no: Haffigan's too old. It really doesn't pay now {{to take on}} {{men over}} forty even for unskilled labor, which I suppose is all Haffigan would be good for. No: Haffigan had better go to America, or into the Union, poor old chap! He's worked out, you know: you can see it.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a little}} {{difficult}} to follow, and Mr. Touchett considered it for a while. At last he said: [...] "Isabel's a sweet young thing; but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she's <b>so</b> good as that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it {{was kind}} of mean to Harriet," [...] said Anne rebukingly, [...] "to go with her and get her talked about and then drop her as <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> yourself, Jerome?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think! That you {{are very}} likely to succeed,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{with one of his}} beaming smiles. 'Ah!' said Mr. Magnus. 'But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Pickwick? <b>Do</b> <b>you,</b> though?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; but <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Kate?' said Mrs Nickleby, {{with as much}} gravity {{as if it were}} a {{question}} of the most imminent and thrilling interest. 'If you don't, say so at once, you know; because it's just as well to be correct, particularly on a point of this kind, which is very curious and worth settling while one thinks about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--but you {{understand}} one thing by staying with me; and I understand another. You, perhaps, {{could make up}} your mind to be about my hand and chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Come--tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} strangest {{instincts}} {{of my own}} about some things," [...] {{she said to me}} one day. [...] "For instance, I knew that Oscar was bright and fair--I mean I felt it in myself--on that delightful evening when I first heard the sound of his voice. It went straight from my ear to my heart; and it described him, just as the rest of you have described him to me since. Mrs. Finch tells me his complexion is lighter than mine. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> too? I am so glad to hear that he is fairer than I am! Did you ever meet before with a person like me? I have the oddest ideas in this blind head of mine. I associate life and beauty with light colors, and death and crime with dark colors. If I married a man with a dark complexion, and if I recovered my sight afterwards, I should run away from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd!--queer!--why, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> We are {{not very}} prudish, to be sure, here in the South--do pretty much as we please--enjoy life, and {{all that sort of}} thing, you know-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that's a {{long time}} hence; next autumn's far off," [...] Osmond continued; [...] "and {{meantime}} {{there are things that}} more nearly interest us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me <b>so</b> very proud?" [...] he suddenly asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "She never {{breathed a}} {{syllable}} about what you'd writ. I warrant you she's close-mouthed enough, {{when she gets}} a line from a young man. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> her <b>so</b> desp'rate handsome as Zeph says she is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In the Malplaquet time, once on some occasion, it is said, two English Officers, {{not well}} {{informed}} upon the matter, and provoking enough in their contemptuous ignorance, were reasoning {{with one another}} in Friedrich Wilhelm's hearing, as to the warlike powers of the Prussian State, and Whether the King of Prussia could on his own strength maintain a standing army of 15,000? Without subsidies, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>so</b> many as 15,000? Friedrich Wilhelm, incensed at the thing and at the tone, is reported to have said with heat: [...] "Yes, 30,000!" [...] [Forster, i. 138.] whereat the military men slightly wagged their heads, letting the matter drop for the present. But he makes it good by degrees; twofold or threefold;--and will have an army of from seventy to a hundred thousand before he dies, ["72,000 field-troops, 30,000 garrison-troops" [...] (Gestandnisse eines OEster reichischen Veterans, Breslau, 1788, i. 64).] the best-drilled of fighting men; and what adds much to the wonder, a full Treasury withal. This is the Brandenburg Spartan King; acquainted with National Economics. Alone of existing Kings he lays by money annually; and is laying by many other and far more precious things, for Prussia and the little Boy he has here.|$|E
6000|$|Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> When I say [...] "The {{kingdom of}} God is {{salvation}}," [...] {{do you think}} it is? Have you even any clear notion of what I mean when I say it? Some of you have not, I am afraid; you cannot see at first sight what salvation and the kingdom of God have to do with each other. And why? You think salvation means being saved from hell, and going to heaven, when you die. And so it does: but I trust in God and in God's holy scripture, that it means a great deal more; for I think it means being unfit for hell, and fit for heaven, before we die. At least, so says the Church Catechism, which teaches every little child to thank his Heavenly Father for having brought him into such a state of salvation in this life, even while he is young. Thanks be to The Spirit of God which taught our fore-fathers to put these precious words into the Church Catechism, to guard us against falling into the very same mistake as the Pharisees of old fell into, when they asked our Lord when the kingdom of God was to come. And, believe me, it is easy enough and common enough to fall into the same mistake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Now I don't {{agree with}} you at all, brother," [...] {{observed}} Miss Peppy. [...] "I think that good fortune is always good fortune, and never can be bad fortune. I wish it would only come to me sometimes, but it never does, {{and when it does}} it never remains long. Only think how she'll flaunt about now, with a coach-and-four perhaps, and such like. I really think that fortune made a mistake in this case, for she has been used to such mean ways, not that I mean anything bad by mean, you know, but only low and common, including food and domestic habits, as well as society, that--that--dear me, I don't exactly know how to express myself, but it's a puzzle to me to know how she'll ever come to be able to spend it all, indeed it is. I wonder why we are subjected to such surprises so constantly, and then it's so perplexing too, because one {{will never be able to}} remember that she's not a fisherwoman as she used to be, and will call her Jessie in spite of one's-self; and how it ever came about, that's another puzzle. But after all there is no accounting for the surprising way in which things do come about, dear me, in this altogether unaccountable world. Take a little more soup, Captain Bingley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Egyptians {{are going}} to burrow through our walls," [...] he said; [...] "but when they do we will drive them like rats out of the holes. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Jethro?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh you'll get me one!" [...] Her manner {{presented}} this as {{so certain}} that it wasn't worth dilating on; so instead of dilating she inquired abruptly a second time: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm <b>so</b> simple?" ...|$|R
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> He has induced us {{to bring}} him into the world; but he chose his parents very incongruously, I think. I see nothing of myself in him, and less of you.|$|R
