They consisted of NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals 200mm in diameter by 50mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5mm thick lead layer. The burst <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> was 500 to 50 microjoules per square meter (510 to 510 erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum and rise time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8s.|$|E
25|$|The odor <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> for {{phosgene}} is 0.4 ppm, {{four times}} the threshold limit value. Its high toxicity arises from {{the action of the}} phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary alveoli, the site of gas exchange: their damage disrupts the blood–air barrier, causing suffocation. It reacts with the amines of the proteins, causing crosslinking by formation of urea-like linkages, in accord with the reactions discussed above. Phosgene detection badges are worn by those at risk of exposure.|$|E

Forward motion {{is limited by}} the subtended angular velocity <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> (SAVT), and horizontal and vertical motion acuity are limited by lateral motion thresholds. The lateral motion limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, lateral motion becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away from the path of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens' power law and Weber–Fechner law.|$|E

The effective change for the whole nociceptive system can be reflected in changes of psychophysical characteristics, e. g., <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds.</b> However, {{it is challenging to}} separate contributions of distinct altered mechanisms with measurements of thresholds only. Here, we aim to understand how these alterations affect Aδ-fiber-mediated nociceptive detection of electrocutaneous stimuli. First, with a neurophysiology-based model, we study the effects of single-model parameters on <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Second, we derive an expression of model parameters determining the functional relationship between <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds</b> and the interpulse interval for double-pulse stimuli. Third, in a case study with topical capsaicin treatment, we translate neuroplasticity into plausible changes of model parameters.

Using the proposed strategy, we can evaluate tradeoffs between test set size, test coverage, <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds,</b> measurement noise, chip performance, and estimated yield.

25|$|Sorbic acid is a {{winemaking}} additive used {{often in}} sweet wines as a preservative against fungi, bacteria and yeast growth.

Most humans have a <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> of 135mg/l, with some having a sensitivity to detect its presence at 50mg/l. Sorbic acid can produce off flavors and aromas which can be described as “rancid”.

25|$|Cats, {{like dogs}} {{and many other}} animals, have a tapetum lucidum, which is a {{reflective}} layer behind the retina that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye. While this improves {{the ability to see}} in darkness, it appears to reduce net visual acuity, thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like pupil closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive retina, and improving depth of field. Big cats have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.|$|E
40|$|Pain {{disorders}} can {{be initiated}} and maintained by malfunctioning {{of one or}} several mechanisms underlying the nociceptive function. Psychophysical procedures allow the estimation of nociceptive <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds</b> using intra-epidermal electrical stimuli. By varying the temporal properties of electrical stimuli, various contributions of nociceptive processes to stimulus processing can be observed. To observe the responsiveness of nociceptive thresholds to changes in nociceptive function, a model of capsaicin-induced nerve defunctionalization was used. Its effect on nociceptive <b>detections</b> <b>thresholds</b> was investigated {{over a period of}} 84 days. A cutaneous capsaicin (8 %) patch was applied for 60 min to the upper leg of eight healthy human participants. Single- and double-pulse electrical stimuli were presented in a pseudo-random order using an intra-epidermal electrode. Stimuli and corresponding responses were recorded on both treated and untreated skin areas prior to capsaicin application and on days 2, 7, 28, and 84. Increases in electrical <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds</b> at the capsaicin area were observed on days 2 and 7 for single-pulse stimuli. <b>Detection</b> <b>thresholds</b> corresponding to double-pulse stimuli were increased on days 7 and 28, suggesting a delayed and longer lasting effect on double-pulse stimuli. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the responsiveness of <b>detection</b> <b>thresholds</b> to capsaicin application depends on the temporal properties of electrical stimuli.

2500|$|Sweetness, usually {{regarded}} as a pleasurable sensation, is produced {{by the presence of}} sugars and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein coupled receptors coupled to the G protein gustducin found on the taste buds. At least two different variants of the [...] "sweetness receptors" [...] must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human <b>detection</b> <b>threshold</b> for sucrose is 10 millimoles per liter. For lactose it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin. The gustducin then activates the molecule adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the production of the molecule cAMP, or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.|$|E
