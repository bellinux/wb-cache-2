40|$|Introduction: Hemolytic {{disease of}} the newborn was first {{described}} in the medical literature 1609, when it was diagnosed in one French housewife. In 1932 Diamond and colleagues described the mutual relationship of <b>fetal</b> hydrops, jaundice, <b>anemia</b> and erythoblastosis, which was later called fetal erytroblastosis. Hemolytic {{disease of the}} newborn (HDN) {{in the strict sense}} is considered disease whose basis is accelerated immune de-struction of fetal/child erythrocytes that are bound to IgG antibodies of maternal origin. These antibodies are directed against antigens of father’s origin, which are present in the fetal/children’s erythrocytes and that the mother’s immune system recognizes them as foreign antigens. Goal: Th...|$|R
50|$|Blood {{testing for}} the mother is called an Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) or an Indirect Agglutination Test (IAT). This test tells whether there are {{antibodies}} in the maternal plasma. If positive, the antibody is identified and given a titer. Critical titers are associated with significant risk of <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and hydrops. Titers of 1:8 or higher is considered critical for Kell. Titers of 1:16 or higher are considered critical for all other antibodies. After critical titer is reached, care is based on MCA scans. If antibodies are low and have a sudden jump later in pregnancy, an MCA scan is warranted. If the titer undergoes a 4 fold increase, it should be considered significant regardless of if the critical value has been reached. It {{should be noted that}} maternal titers are not useful in predicting <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> after the first affected gestation and should not be used for the basis of care. Titers are tested monthly until 24 weeks, after which they are done every 2 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Hydrops fetalis usually {{stems from}} <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia,</b> when the heart needs to pump {{a much greater}} volume of blood to deliver {{the same amount of}} oxygen. This anemia can have either an immune or non-immune cause. Non-immune hydrops can also be {{unrelated}} to anemia, for example if a fetal tumor or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation increases the demand for blood flow. The increased demand for cardiac output leads to heart failure, and corresponding edema.|$|E
50|$|Hemolytic {{disease of}} the fetus and newborn {{is similar to a}} {{transfusion}} reaction in that the mother's antibodies cannot tolerate the fetus's antigens, which happens when the immune tolerance of pregnancy is impaired. In many instances the maternal immune system attacks the fetal blood cells, resulting in <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia.</b> HDN ranges from mild to severe. Severe cases require intrauterine transfusions or early delivery to survive, while mild cases may only require phototherapy at birth.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Hydrops Fetalis is {{a serious}} {{condition}} in fetal period, characterized {{by the presence of}} serous fluid accumulation in at least two potential spaces in fetus including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites. The incidence of hydrops fetalis is one per 2500 - 3000 pregnancies. This condition is followed by different diseases. <b>Fetal</b> hemolytic <b>anemia</b> and its hypoxemia due to hydrops fetalis are potentially life or function threatening. Mortality rate is 50 - 90 %; this poor prognosis is improving with advances in prenatal and medical treatment.                    Methods and Materials This study performed on patients’ records with hydrops fetalis diagnosis in one of the neonatal referral and academic center, Vali-e-Asr Hospital Tehran, the capital of Iran from 2003 to 2010. Etiology, prognosis, and frequency of Hydrops fetalis in newborns were evaluated. Results Out of 10878 cases, 0. 35 % was born with hydrops fetalis: 18. 42 % immune [Rh incompatibility  (% 85. 71), Kell antigen system(% 14. 29) ] and 81. 58 % non-immune.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} the incidence and {{risk factors for}} neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in children with hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn treated with intrauterine transfusion (IUT). Study DesignNeurodevelopmental outcome in children at least 2 years of age was assessed using standardized tests, including the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, according to the children's age. Primary outcome was the incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment defined as {{at least one of}} the following: cerebral palsy, severe developmental delay, bilateral deafness, and/or blindness. ResultsA total of 291 children were evaluated at a median age of 8. 2 years (range, 2 – 17 years). Cerebral palsy was detected in 6 (2. 1 %) children, severe developmental delay in 9 (3. 1 %) children, and bilateral deafness in 3 (1. 0 %) children. The overall incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment was 4. 8 % (14 / 291). In a multivariate regression analysis including only preoperative risk factors, severe hydrops was independently associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (odds ratio, 11. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 – 92. 7).

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the fetal hematocrit (Hct) decrease along repeated intravascular intrauterine fetal transfusions (IUTs) and test the hypothesis that, after consecutive IUTs, there is a lower Hct drop oV. Methods From July 1996 to June 2006, pregnancies submitted to IUT for <b>fetal</b> hemolytic <b>anemia</b> treatment had their data assessed. The daily rate of decrease in fetal Hct was calculated by dividing the diVerence between the posttransfusion Hct of the previous IUT and the pretransfusion Hct of the current IUT, by the number of days between the transfusions. Fetuses with other abnormalities or submitted to intraperitoneal transfusions were excluded. Results Eighty-one women were submitted to IUT during the alluded period, ensuing 296 intrauterine transfusions. The perinatal survival was 89. 9 % (n = 80), with 92. 0 % (n = 69) of nonhydropic fetuses survival. Hydropic fetuses showed higher hematocrit drop oV than nonhydropic ones (P < 0. 01). Compared to the interval between the Wrst and second IUT, the daily fetal Hct decline was lower after the third one (P < 0. 05). Stratifying by the presence of hydrops, nonhydropic fetuses showed a smaller decrease at the third and fourth intervals (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). Among hydropic fetuses, there is a trend of smaller Hct decrease along successive IUTs (interval 3, P = 0. 08; interval 4, P = 0. 07; and interval 5, P = 0. 10). Conclusions Following some IUTs, fetal hematocrit decrease is lower and larger intervals between the transfusions could be accomplished. Multicenter studies should investigate an algorithm for timing subsequent IUTs, considering Doppler values, estimated fetal hematocrit decline and other parameters...|$|R
50|$|In ABO {{hemolytic}} {{disease of}} the newborn (also known as ABO HDN) maternal IgG antibodies with specificity for the ABO blood group system pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation where they can cause hemolysis of fetal red blood cells {{which can lead to}} <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and HDN. In contrast to Rh disease, about half of the cases of ABO HDN occur in a firstborn baby and ABO HDN does not become more severe after further pregnancies.|$|E
50|$|Parvovirus {{infection}} in pregnant women {{is associated with}} hydrops fetalis due to severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia,</b> sometimes leading to miscarriage or stillbirth. The risk of fetal loss is about 10% if infection occurs before pregnancy week 20 (especially between weeks 14 and 20), but minimal after then. Routine screening of the antenatal sample would enable the pregnant mother to determine the risk of infection. Knowledge of her status would allow the mother to avoid contact with individuals suspected or known to have an ongoing infection, however, at the present time, antenatal testing for immunity is not recommended, {{since there is no}} good means to prevent the infection, there is not specific therapy and there are no vaccines available. It may increase maternal anxiety and fear without proven benefit. The best approach would be to recommend all pregnant women to avoid contact with children with current symptoms of infection, as described above. The risk to the fetus will be reduced with correct diagnosis of the anemia (by ultrasound scans) and treatment (by blood transfusions). There is some evidence that intrauterine Parvovirus B19 infection leads to developmental abnormalities in childhood.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{complication}} is a hemorrhage, or bleeding, of the puncture site {{and can be}} especially dangerous when the fetus is younger than 21 weeks. [...] The risk of hemorrhage is greater if the fetus has a defect that affects its platelets. A transfusion of donor platelets is usually done in such cases {{to reduce the risk}} of bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, immediate delivery is an option as long as the fetus is old enough to survive, or fetal blood volume restoration may be considered. [...] Another possible complication is cord hematoma, which doesn’t have any characteristic symptoms but can be indicated by sudden bradycardia. [...] If the hematoma is under control, the fetus is monitored until stabilized. If the fetus remains unstable, a delivery may be done. [...] Fetomaternal hemorrhage is another complication that occurs when the fetal blood mixes into the maternal blood. A small fetomaternal hemorrhage could cause an increase in maternal antigens, while a large fetomaternal hemorrhage could cause <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and death. [...] Fetal bradycardia, low heart rate, is another complication that may occur. [...] Most cases of fetal bradycardia are self-resolved within five minutes. [...] The complication of infection has a low incidence rate, and preventative measures are implemented against the risk of infection, such as antibiotic usage and the aseptic technique. However, vertical transmission of a virus such as HIV may occur. Fetal loss may also occur, especially in the presence of several risk factors, including fetal abnormalities, operator errors, placental penetration, and viability of the fetus.|$|E
40|$|Giant chorioangioma is a placental tumor {{associated}} with gestational complications such as preeclampsia, polyhydramnios and hemorrhage. In addition, this tumor {{might lead to}} the incidence of non-immune fetal hydrops, heart failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, weight loss and death among neonates. In this case report, the clinical image of a term newborn (weighing 2800 g) with one-minute Apgar score of 7 was suggestive of sepsis {{on the second day}} of birth. Moreover, epistaxis, petechia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, cardiomegaly and hepatosplenomegaly were detected in the neonate, which required blood transfusion and antibiotic therapy. However, in case of chorioangioma in the gestational history, it was possible to detect the motive for a clinical sepsis-like disease. According to the pathophysiological explanation, this tumor functions as a "dead space", increasing the rate of blood ejection with subsequent <b>fetal</b> heart failure, <b>anemia</b> through intratumoral hemorrhage or fetal-maternal transfusion, and consumption or intratumoral sequestration resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

40|$|Impaired {{switching}} from fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to adult globin gene expression leads to hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) in adult life. This is of prime interest because elevated HbF levels ameliorate beta-thalassemia and sickle cell <b>anemia.</b> <b>Fetal</b> hemoglobin levels are regulated by complex mechanisms involving factors linked {{or not to}} the beta-globin gene locus. To search for factors putatively involved in gamma-globin gene expression, we examined the reticulocyte transcriptome of three siblings who had different HbF levels and different degrees of beta-thalassemia severity although {{they had the same}} alpha- and beta-globin gene cluster genotypes. Using a differential mRNA display approach, we identified a cDNA of the cold shock domain protein A (CSDA), a trans-acting factor previously reported to interact in vitro with the gamma-globin gene promoter. Real time quantitative analysis in the three patients and CSDA expression studies in the human erythroleukemic K 562 cell line showed an inverse relationship between gamma-globin and CSDA mRNA levels. Our study demonstrates that CSDA acts as a repressor of gamma-globin genes in vivo and is a novel quantitative trait locus for HPFH. We expect our findings pave the way to novel therapeutic strategies, based on gene-silencing, for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: An {{experienced}} sonographer can {{by listening}} to the Doppler audio signals perceive various timbres that distinguish different types of umbilical artery flow despite an unchanged pulsatility index (PI). Our aim was to develop an objective measure of the Doppler audio signals recorded from fetoplacental circulation in a sheep model. METHODS: Various degrees of pathological flow velocity waveforms in the umbilical artery, {{similar to those in}} human complicated pregnancies, were induced by microsphere embolization of the placental bed (embolization model, 7 lamb fetuses, 370 Doppler recordings) or by <b>fetal</b> hemodilution (<b>anemia</b> model, 4 lamb fetuses, 184 recordings). A subjective 11 -step operator auditory scale (OAS) was related to conventional Doppler parameters, PI and time average mean velocity (TAM), and to sound frequency analysis of Doppler signals (sound frequency with the maximum energy content [MAXpeak] and frequency band at maximum level minus 15 dB [MAXpeak- 15 dB] over several heart cycles). RESULTS: WE FOUND A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OAS AND PI: median Rho - 0. 73 (range - 0. 35 - - 0. 94) and - 0. 68 (range - 0. 57 - - 0. 78) in the two lamb models, respectively. There was a positive correlation between OAS and TAM in both models: median Rho 0. 80 (range 0. 58 - 0. 95) and 0. 90 (range 0. 78 - 0. 95), respectively. A strong correlation was found between TAM and the results of sound spectrum analysis; in the embolization model the median r was 0. 91 (range 0. 88 - 0. 97) for MAXpeak and 0. 91 (range 0. 82 - 0. 98) for MAXpeak- 15 dB. In the anemia model, the corresponding values were 0. 92 (range 0. 78 - 0. 96) and 0. 96 (range 0. 89 - 0. 98), respectively. CONCLUSION: Audio-spectrum analysis reflects the subjective perception of Doppler sound signals in the umbilical artery and has a strong correlation to TAM-velocity. This information might be of importance for clinical management of complicated pregnancies as an addition to conventional Doppler parameters...|$|R

40|$|Chorioangioma is {{a primary}} benign tumour with {{predominantly}} vascular involvement. It is found in 1 % of all placentas undergoing careful and systematic histopathological examination. A rarer form is the clinically relevant chorioangioma {{which is likely to}} be associated with complications like polyhydramnios, pre-term birth, IUGR, <b>anemia,</b> <b>fetal</b> congested heart decompensation, non-immune fetal hydrops, perinatal mortality. Chorioangioma generally presents an increased consistency compared to adjacent tissues; it tends to be single, rounded and reddish-brown in colour. The preferred localisation is on the fetal side of the placental disk and it may protrude into the amniochorial cavity; the volume is variable (but rarely exceeds a maximum diameter of 4 - 5 cm). Of the known 3 histotypes of chorioangioma (angiomatous, cellular, degenerative), the first is the most insidious: the intratumoral vascular bed represents an arteriovenous shunt in the systematic circulation of the fetus # 150; sometimes causing dramatic hemodynamic consequences # 150; as well as a functional empty space (blood short-circuited through the neoplasm circulation would be deprived of the possibility of adequate gaseous and metabolic exchanges {{at the level of the}} terminal villi). Having been identified as early as 1798, chorioangioma has recently been the subject of renewed interest for the following reasons: 1) the possibility of prenatal diagnosis, prohibited to earlier generations of authors, following the development of instrumental techniques like ultrasonography and flowmetry; 2) the acquisition of new knowledge regarding the physiopathology of the tumour and the etiopathogenesis of its main complications; 3) improved prognostic capacity accompanied by better prospects for correct management; 4) wider awareness of the range of therapeutic options available...|$|R
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] methods for long-term preservation of cord red blood cells (RBCs) are needed to ensure a readily available supply of RBCs to treat <b>fetal</b> and neonatal <b>anemia.</b> Cryopreservation is a potential long-term storage strategy for maintaining the quality of cord RBCs for the use in intrauterine and neonatal transfusion. However, during cryopreservation, cells are subjected to damaging osmotic stresses during cryoprotectant addition and removal and freezing and thawing that require knowledge of osmotic tolerance limits in order to optimize the preservation process. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the osmotic tolerance limits of cord RBCs in conditions relevant to cryopreservation, and compare the results to the osmotic tolerance limits of adult RBCs. Osmotic tolerance limits were determined by exposing RBCs to solutions of different concentrations to induce a range of osmotic volume changes. Three treatment groups of adult and cord RBCs were tested: 1) isotonic saline, 2) 40 % w/v glycerol, and 3) frozen-thawed RBCs in 40 % w/v glycerol. We show that cord RBCs are more sensitive to shrinkage and swelling than adult RBCs, indicating that osmotic tolerance limits should be considered when adding and removing cryoprotectants. In addition, freezing and thawing resulted in both cord and adult RBCs becoming more sensitive to post-thaw swelling requiring that glycerol removal procedures for both cell types ensure that cell volume excursions are maintained below 1. 7 times the isotonic osmotically active volume to attain good post-wash cell recovery.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) {{maintain}} themselves throughout life by undergoing self-renewing divisions and by differentiating to generate {{all the blood}} and immune system cells in the body. Tumor suppressors {{play an important role}} in regulating signaling pathways that maintain HSCs while avoiding leukemogenesis. Deficiency in the tumor suppressor Pten depletes HSCs but expands leukemia-initiating cells. Understanding this mechanistic difference could lead to anti-leukemia therapies with less toxicity to HSCs. Indeed, the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, blocks HSC depletion and leukemogenesis in Pten-deficient cells, raising the question of how mTOR activation depletes HSCs. In contrast to what occurs after FoxO 1 / 3 / 4 deletion, we found that the depletion of Pten-deficient HSCs was not caused by oxidative stress and could not be blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine. Instead, Pten deletion induced the expression of p 16 Ink 4 a and p 53 in HSCs, and p 19 Arf and p 53 in other hematopoietic cells. Rapamycin treatment attenuated these increases. Analysis of compound mutant mice indicated that p 53 suppressed leukemogenesis and promoted HSC depletion after Pten deletion. p 16 Ink 4 a also promoted HSC depletion but had a limited role suppressing leukemogenesis. p 19 Arf suppressed leukemogenesis but did not deplete HSCs. Pten deficiency and FoxO deficiency therefore deplete HSCs by different mechanisms. These results provide functional evidence that mTOR activation depletes stem cells by inducing a tumor suppressor response. Little is known about whether autophagic processes are active in HSCs and whether they contribute to HSC maintenance. FIP 200 plays important roles in mammalian autophagy and other cellular functions, but its role in hematopoiesis has not been examined. We found that conditional deletion of FIP 200 in hematopoietic cells led to impaired autophagy in the <b>fetal</b> liver, severe <b>anemia,</b> and perinatal lethality. FIP 200 was also cell-autonomously required for the maintenance of fetal HSCs as FIP 200 -deleted HSCs were unable to reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients. FIP 200 ablation increased the rate of cell-cycling in HSCs, which may have contributed to HSC depletion. Interestingly, FIP 200 -deleted HSCs exhibited increased mitochondrial mass and elevated reactive oxygen species levels. Our data identify FIP 200 as a key intrinsic regulator of fetal HSCs and implicate a potential role for autophagy in the maintenance of fetal hematopoiesis and HSCs...|$|R

To compare current criteria for severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> diagnosis. Methodology. A cohort study analyzed 105 alloimmunized fetuses that underwent cordocentesis due to risk of anemia. Concordance among the diagnostic criteria for severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia,</b> hemoglobin deficit> 7 g/dL, hemoglobin deficit ≥ 5 g/dL, and hemoglobin concentration 7. 0 g/dL andhemoglobin concentration 7. 0 g/dL reference, and 0. 77 (Kappa index, IC 95 %: 0. 64 to 0. 90) when comparing hemoglobin deficit≥ 5. 0 g/dL and hemoglobin concentration < 0. 55 MoM standards. Eighteen cases were classified differently {{depending on the}} criteria used. The cut-off point of hemoglobin deficit ≥ 5 g/dL was the best criterion to discriminate fetuses with poor perinatal outcome in our study. Conclusions. Relevant discordances in classification of severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> were pointed out...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hereditary spherocytosis is {{the most}} common form of {{inherited}} hemolytic anemia and is characterized by a structural defect in the RBC membrane. The disorder is commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and leads to a mild to moderate anemia. The autosomal recessive form of hereditary spherocytosis is rarely reported in association with <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and hydrops fetalis. Case: A 25  year old G 5 P 2112 at 25 2 / 7  weeks gestation presents with severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and nonimmune hydrops fetalis requiring multiple fetal intrauterine transfusions. After delivery, the neonate required several double volume exchange transfusions and ultimately was diagnosed with autosomal recessive hereditary spherocytosis weeks after birth. The neonate was identified to have a rare homozygous genetic mutation, SPTA 1 c. 6154 delG, which leads to absent production of normal α-spectrin. Conclusion: The case highlights the importance of considering less common genetic mutations involving the RBC structural proteins when patients present with severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and nonimmune hydrops fetalis...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite {{significant}} advances, perinatal hemolytic {{disease has}} not been eradicated and is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. An accurate method for antenatal diagnosis and quantification of <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> is a crucial step prior {{to the performance of}} invasive procedures, which are not risk-free. the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) is currently the most popular non-invasive diagnostic method used to quantify <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> and determine the exact timing for transfusion the combined use of MCA-PSV and descending thoracic aorta mean velocity (DTA-MV) {{has not been}} previously evaluated. Since this strategy has the potential to decrease false positive results it could reduce unnecessary cordocenteses, therefore minimizing fetal risks. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of MCA-PSV associated with DTA-MV in the prediction of <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia.</b> Method Retrospective analysis of 90 cordocenteses performed on alloimmunized pregnancies in a single hospital MCA-PSV and DTA-MV were performed immediately before cordocentesis. the Dopplervelocimetry findings were compared with fetal hemoglobin concentration. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of MCA-PSV and DTA-MV in the prediction of moderate/severe <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> were calculated. Results the individual sensitivity of MCA-PSV and DTA-MV was 100 and 95. 7 %, specificity was 65 and 100 % and accuracy was 92. 2 and 96. 7 %, respectively. the combination of both vessels produced a higher overall accuracy (98. 6 %). Conclusion MCA-PSV is more sensitive and DTA-MV is more specific in the detection of <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia.</b> the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained by the association of both Doppler evaluations.

40|$|Several {{infections in}} adults warrant special {{consideration}} in pregnant women given the potential fetal consequences. Among these is parvovirus B 19 deserves special attention since {{the harmful effects}} on the pregnant woman and fetus. It can then cause <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia,</b> non-immune fetal hydrops and fetal death. Among cases with fetal demise, B 19 is foundin significant numbers, especially in the second andthird trimesters of pregnancy. There is no specific treatment or prophylaxis available against B 19 infection, but counseling of non-immune mothers and active monitoring of confirmed maternal infections with intervention to correct <b>fetal</b> <b>anemia</b> is likely to decrease mortality...|$|E
