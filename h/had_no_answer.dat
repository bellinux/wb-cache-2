5|$|He {{successfully}} {{defended his}} championship belt at , defeating former Shooto Middleweight Champion Hayato Sakurai via TKO due to strikes at 3:01 {{of the fourth}} round. In {{the first round of}} the fight, Hughes spent all the time either clinching Sakurai up against the fence, or ripping his feet out from under him. In round 2, Sakurai landed a right hand that sent Hughes to the mat; despite this, Matt won the round by spending three minutes hitting Sakurai with elbows from the top position. At the start of the third round, Hughes quickly slammed Sakurai to the ground, again staying three minutes on top. He looked too strong for Sakurai. Hughes finished the bout in the 4th round, by taking down Sakurai and transitioning to full mount. After one minute of ground-and-pound onslaught, the contest was over as Sakurai <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> for the champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{next three}} seasons saw mixed results for New Zealand, who won all their Tri-Nations tests in 1997 before losing the {{title for the}} first time in 1998. In 1998 New Zealand lost all five tests in the Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup series (two to South Africa and three to Australia), the first time they had lost four tests in {{succession}} since 1949. The following year they suffered their worst test loss, 28–7 to Australia in Sydney. At the 1999 World Cup later that year, the All Blacks dominated their pool, handing England a 30–16 defeat at Twickenham. They advanced past Scotland 30–18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. After New Zealand finished the first half 17–10 ahead, France then produced a famous half of rugby to which New Zealand <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer,</b> winning 43–31. Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches Wayne Smith and Tony Gilbert.|$|E

Along with another substantial gain during the third leg, Oracle Team USA <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> to the Kiwi boat and finished a distant second 1:06 behind.

25|$|This {{time in the}} Finals, Detroit {{would face}} the San Antonio Spurs, led by superstar Tim Duncan and {{international}} players such as Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili. The Spurs won {{the first two games}} at home before the Pistons matched them with two wins in Detroit, setting up a crucial game 5 in which San Antonio managed a one-point victory. Detroit would respond with a win on the road in game 6, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> for Duncan and the Spurs attack and lost the series in game 7. Wallace averaged 10 points and 11.3 rebounds throughout the 2005 playoffs.|$|E

25|$|To be able {{to reach}} the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured {{architect}} Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Al Bairuni is less {{credited}} for {{his greatest}} contribution in resolving the thorniest question of biblical scholarship. The disparity between Synoptics and Gospel of John <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> until Anne Jaubert surfaced 'Jaubert hypothesis' in her book, “la date de la cène” in 1958. She rallied {{on the fact}} that Jesus and his disciples probably used calendar of the Book of Jubilee i.e. Essenes Calendar from DSS. The idea was grasped from Al-Bairuni's book ‘Kitab al Makalaat’ in which he highlighted that the people of the cave near Jerusalem were using a different calendar. This discovery and juxtaposition has finally settled this enigma of the biblical scholarship.|$|E

The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney.

25|$|The duo's later {{campaigns against}} Arakan (1545–1547) and Siam (1547–1549) however fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles, {{and went on}} to lay siege to the capitals, Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya respectively. But they still <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> to heavily {{fortified}} defenses equipped with Portuguese firearms, and had to retreat both times. Toungoo's own Portuguese supplied cannon had little impact on the walls of both capitals. Nor did they have enough manpower (19,000 and 12,000 troops respectively in Arakanese and Siamese campaigns) for long-term sieges. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung by 1549 had built up the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, stretching from Pagan in the north to Tavoy in the south.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010s, an {{increasing}} amount of Iraqis, especially {{young people in}} the capital city of Baghdad and the Kurdistan Region, were leaving Islam for a variety of reasons. Some cite the lack of women's rights in Islam, others the political climate, which is dominated by conflicts between Shia Muslim parties who seek to expand their power more than they try to improve citizens' living conditions. Many young ex-Muslims sought refuge in the Iraqi Communist Party, and advocated for secularism from within its ranks. The sale of books on atheism by authors such as Abdullah al-Qasemi and Richard Dawkins has risen in Baghdad. In Iraqi Kurdistan, a 2011 AK-News survey asking whether respondents believed God existed, resulted in 67% replying 'yes', 21% 'probably', 4% 'probably not', 7% 'no' and 1% <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> The subsequent harsh battle against Islamic State and its literalist implementation of Sharia caused numerous youths to dissociate themselves from Islam altogether, either by adopting Zoroastrianism or secretly embracing atheism.|$|E

25|$|Bereft of its Australian players Tasmania {{suffered}} in the state match against the tourists, but still 12,000 {{came to see the}} game at Launceston. Hutton, who was lucky with the toss in Australia, won again, chose this time to bat and made 61, but the star of the day was the stylish Tom Graveney with 134. They added 127 for the second wicket, then Graveney put on 105 with Denis Compton (50) for the third. There was a small collapse from 243/2 to 281/6, but Vic Wilson (cricketer) (62 not out) and Johnny Wardle entertained with 111 for the sixth wicket and Hutton declared at 427/7 on the second morning, Noel Diprose the best of the bowlers with 4/107. The Tasmanians <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> to the in-swing and off-cutters of Peter Loader who took 6/22 off 12 eight-ball overs and were out for 117, captain Emerson Rodwell had to retire hurt on 2, but returned to be bowled by Loader for 11. Hutton, 310 runs ahead elected to bat again, perhaps to entertain the Saturday crowd the next day and sent in nightwatchmen Frank Tyson to open with Reg Simpson. Simpson failed again, ending his chances of playing in the Tests and Bob Appleyard joined Tyson. The MCC scratched round the next day for 133/6 declared, Tyson's 27 was the top score and Terence Cowley took 4/53. Tasmania had no chance of making 444 runs to win and Hutton took the chance to exercise his bowlers. Mike Hyland (49) and added 60 with John Maddox (62 not out), who made his highest First Class score, but was left standing as the rest fell away and Tasmania were out for 200 for a 243 run win.|$|E

The assault was made from three cargo-carrying LVTs. To save wear and tear, they were towed across Seeadler Harbour by LCMs and cut loose for the final run in to shore. The cavalrymen found well constructed and sited bunkers with interlocking fields of fire covering all approaches, and deadly accurate snipers. The next morning an LCM brought over a medium tank, for which the Japanese <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer,</b> and the cavalrymen were able to overcome the defenders at a cost of eight killed and 46wounded; 43dead Japanese naval personnel were counted.
