5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, and it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how far {{previous}} reigns {{had broken}} Roman Catholic devotion, with its {{belief in the}} saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken.

Precisely what {{happened}} <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine,</b> but Sejanus {{seems to have}} covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} Princeps, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the extent}} to which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves.

The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E

5|$|Joehana's œuvre {{consists}} of fourteen books, {{as well as}} numerous editorials and articles in the newspaper Soerapati. In their 1979 review of the author, Kartini et al. {{were able to find}} only six extant titles. It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the printing number was not recorded. As such, sources list works as having been published in different years; for instance, Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923, 1926, and 1928.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, although it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities {{that would be}} attributed to them in later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines {{that have been found}} all over Late Bronze Age Greece.|$|E

In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Gulf Stream off {{the east coast of}} the United States, Cuba, and southern Brazil in the west, and from the Iberian Peninsula to Ghana in the east, possibly including the Mediterranean Sea and Cape Verde. In the Indian Ocean, it has been reported from the Mozambique Channel. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan and Taiwan, northeastern Australia, a number of islands in the Central Pacific northeast of Micronesia, and southern California.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the exact}} number of {{properties}} destroyed during and after Operation Storm, since a large number of houses had already sustained damage {{since the beginning of the}} war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that more than 5,000 homes were destroyed during and after the battle. Out of the 122 Serbian Orthodox churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat. HRW also reported that the vast majority of the abuses during Operation Storm were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale for months afterward, included summary executions of elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serb villages and property. In the months following Operation Storm, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed and another 110 persons forcibly disappeared. One such example is the Varivode massacre, in which nine Serb civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Stigand first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England (reigned 1016–1035). In that year he was appointed to Cnut's church at Ashingdon, or Assandun, which was dedicated by the reforming bishop Wulfstan of York. Little is known of Stigand's life during Cnut's reign, but {{he must have had}} a place at the royal court, as he witnessed occasional charters. Following Cnut's death Stigand successively served Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035–1040) and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042). After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to Emma of Normandy, Cnut's widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor. He may have been Emma's chaplain, and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive, and that he owed his position at Ashingdon to Emma's influence and favour. Because little is known of Stigand's activities before his appointment as a bishop, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> to whom he owed his position.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} about whether Suillus cothurnatus represents a different species from S.salmonicolor. The online mycological taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary to Index Fungorum. In their 2000 monograph of North American boletes, Alan Bessette and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of S.cothurnatus <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> because of confusion with S.salmonicolor. In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based on the internal transcribed spacer, S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating {{a high degree of}} genetic similarity. These analyses were based on comparing the sequence differences in a single region of ribosomal DNA; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{casualties}} for {{the battle}} are {{almost impossible to}} estimate precisely {{due to a lack}} of records. It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how many South Korean citizens were forcibly conscripted during the battle and how many deserted as opposed to being killed. Larger engagements destroyed entire regiments and even divisions of North Korean troops, and their strength had to be estimated based on accounts of North Koreans captured by the UN. On September 1, the North Korean army numbered approximately 97,850 in South Korea, and up to one third of this number is suspected to have been conscripts from South Korea. In the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, only 25,000 or 30,000 of these soldiers returned to North Korea by the end of the month. Upwards of one third of the attacking force became casualties in the fighting. This would mean North Korean casualties from September 1 to 15 could range from roughly 41,000 to 36,000 killed and captured, with an unknown number of wounded. With the addition of the 5,690 killed in the Bowling Alley, 3,500 at the Naktong Bulge, at least 3,700 at Taegu and an unknown number at P'ohang-dong before September 1, North Korean casualties likely topped 50,000 to 60,000 by the end of the battle. They also lost 239 T-34 tanks and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns; virtually all of the armor they possessed.|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E
