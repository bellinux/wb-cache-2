Another animal, free of BHV 1 infection was similarly treated. Two latent carriers of the virus, intradermally injected with Phosphate-Buffered Saline solution were used as control. The evolution of spontaneous multiplication of lymphocytes and lymphoblastic transformation in vitro induced by three phytomitogens (con A, PHA, PWM) and BHV 1 antigen was followed in all animals. The <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test</b> provoked an increase in spontaneous lymphocyte multiplication in latent carriers {{as well as an}} increase in mitogen- and antigen-induced blastogenesis on the 2 nd and the 9 th day following the treatment. A similar increase occurred on the 9 th day in the BHV 1 -free animal. Therefore, in latent carriers of BHV 1, delayed hypersensitivity testing induces an anamnestic lymphocyte reaction corresponding to the cutaneous one. This first lymphocyte activity is followed, one week later, by a new reaction which occurs both in infected and uninfected animals. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>testing</b> with {{multiple}} antigens is frequently {{used to evaluate}} immunopotentiation therapy in man. Since serial skin testing with a single antigen {{has been shown to}} augment the skin test response, the present study was undertaken to assess the effect of serial <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>testing</b> on skin test reactivity {{with multiple}} antigens. Each of twelve healthy volunteers received 0. 1 ml of five antigens on two occassion, 6 weeks apart. The antigens used were streptokinase-streptodornase, Candida, Trichophyton, mumps and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). The results demonstrated enhancement of skin test reactivity in the majority of tests. Indeed, 38. 9 % of the tests which were negative with the first skin test (less than 10 mm induration) converted to positive. Enhancement in reactivity was observed in the majority of test subjects with all antigens except PPD. Similar enhanced skin test reactivity was observed in fifteen additional subjects tested serially with Candida only. The observations in this study suggest that uncontrolled studies of immunopotentiation must be interpreted with caution since serial <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>testing</b> with single or multiple antigens results in enhanced skin test reactivity...|$|R

40|$|Forty-three cattle {{seronegative}} to bovine herpesvirus- 1 (BHV- 1) {{were given}} {{from one to}} five intradermal injections of BHV- 1 inactivated antigen at four-week intervals. This <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test</b> was assessed by the increase in skin thickness. The activity of the antigen was assessed in five animals which had a previous natural BHV- 1 infection with clinical signs and seroconversion. Anti-BHV- 1 antibodies were detected by seroneutralisation and an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Only one animal showed a significant but slight increase in skin thickness after the first test, but it was negative after a second test. The animals remained seronegative after the first test. Seroconversion was identified in 11 of the 43 animals (25 per cent) submitted to repeated delayed hypersensitivity tests. Five of 37 animals seroconverted after only two tests. The serological response was transient in seven of 11 seroconverted calves. Repeated hypersensitivity tests were therefore able to induce a serological response in seronegative calves but the response was weak and often transient. The test must therefore be applied cautiously to seronegative animals. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{methods of}} {{diagnosis}} and prophylaxis of {{infectious bovine rhinotracheitis}} must consider the concept of latency of the etiological agent, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (Bovine herpesvirus 1; BHV 1). The identification of BHV 1 in nasal mucus samples or a rise in specific antibodies have to be cautiously interpreted, because they can signify either a primary infection or a reexcretion of the virus after reactivation. The isolated virus can also either be a vaccine or a virulent strain. Another aspect of BHV 1 infection diagnosis is the detection of latent carriers, which are able to transmit the virus to uninfected animals; <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test</b> {{seems to be a}} good candidate. The classical methods of prophylaxis protect the animal against the disease, but they should also impede the reexcretion of virulent strains by latent carriers.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>testing</b> to five common recall antigens (Varidase, Candida, PPD, Trichophy-ton, and Mumps) was {{performed}} on 50 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiment}} was to define whether {{and to what extent}} can prophylactic vaccinations against Newcastle disease (ND) and haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) affect the humoral and cellular response in pheasants. The evaluation of humoral response was performed on a basis of agglutinin titre after administered antigen and the cellular immunity index was the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. The pheasants were prophylactically vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (ND) on the 1 st, 28 th and 56 th day of life. Moreover, on the 49 th day of life, part of the birds was given in the drinking water a vaccine containing the HEV (Haemorrhagic Enteritis Virus). Fourteen days after the HEV vaccination, the birds were intravenously given 0. 5 ml of the 10 % SRBC (sheep red blood cells) suspension. Simultaneously with the SRBC administration the <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test</b> was performed by intradermal administration of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). It was shown that in pheasants vaccinated with NDV and additionally with HEV, the specific agglutinin anti-SRBC titre was significantly (p < 0. 05) lower than in birds vaccinated against ND only.

Compared to traditional technologies used for metallic products, EBM and SLM alter the mechanical, physical and chemical properties, which {{are closely related to}} the biocompatibility of metallic products. In this study, we evaluate and compare the biocompatibility, including cytocompatibility, haemocompatibility, skin irritation and skin sensitivity of Ti 6 Al 4 V fabricated by EBM and SLM. The results were analysed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test. Both the EBM and SLM Ti 6 Al 4 V exhibited good cytobiocompatibility. The haemolytic ratios of the SLM and EBM were 2. 24 % and 2. 46 %, respectively, which demonstrated good haemocompatibility. The EBM and SLM Ti 6 Al 4 V samples showed no dermal irritation when exposed to rabbits. In a <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> no skin allergic reaction from the EBM or the SLM Ti 6 Al 4 V was observed in guinea pigs.

40|$|Background: There {{is great}} {{disagreement}} regarding which effector T-cells {{are responsible for}} the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. Further, the possible role of superantigens in modulating the T-cell phenotype responsible for the immunopathogenesis of this disease and the response of these patients to common recall antigens have not been adequately determined. Aims: To investigate the T-cell subsets and activation markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of systemic sclerosis patients before and after stimulation with different bacterial superantigens and common recall antigens to better understand the immunopathogenesis of this disease. Materials and Methods: T-cells (CD 3 +) from 20 systemic sclerosis patients and 17 age-matched healthy controls were studied using flow cytometry for the expression of CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RA, and CD 45 RO at baseline and upon stimulation with different superantigens and recall antigens. Patients were also tested for skin delayed hypersensitivity to common recall antigens. Results: The proportions of CD 45 RA + (naive) and CD 45 RO + (memory) CD 4 + T-cells were found to be significantly higher in patients than in controls upon stimulation with bacterial superantigens. However, T-cells from these patients responded weakly to recall antigen stimulation, indicating a loss of specific memory cells. This was further supported by the skin <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>test</b> in which 16 patients were found to be anergic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both naÃ¯ve (CD 45 RA +) and memory (CD 45 RO +) CD 4 + superantigen-reactive T-cells are effector T-cells that may modulate the pathogenic autoantibody response in systemic sclerosis.

The test was optimised for broiler chickens and evaluated in a stress model in which plasma corticosterone levels were increased by the administration of 0. 5 or 2 mg corticosterone/chicken/day. Keyhole limpet haemocyanin evoked a hypersensitivity type IV response, which was sensitive to increased plasma corticosterone levels. However, the inhibitory effect of 0. 5 mg corticosterone/chicken/day was {{not significantly different from}} the solvent control (ethanol), because of an inhibitory effect of ethanol itself. The inhibitory effect of 2 mg corticosterone/chicken/day was mainly due to an effect on female chickens, indicating a difference in corticosterone sensitivity between gender.

The assessment of cellular immune responses included lymphocyte proliferation assays, the <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>test</b> and IFN-Î³ synthesis in whole blood cultures. One group of calves was inoculated subcutaneously with M. avium followed 12 weeks later by M. bovis-BCG. The other group was vaccinated subcutaneously with BCG alone. Calves previously exposed to M. avium responded more rapidly, as assessed in the in vitro assays, to purified protein derivative (PPD) from M. avium (PPD-A) or M. bovis (PPD-B) than did calves inoculated with BCG only, indicating that the exposure to M. avium had primed the immune response in these calves. Following inoculation of BCG the intensity of the in vitro responses and the <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> skin <b>test</b> to PPD-A was higher for the M. avium-primed animals while the responses to PPD-B were similar in the M. avium-primed and BCG-only groups.
