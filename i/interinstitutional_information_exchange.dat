40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance. As such supply chain partners should effectively <b>exchange</b> strategic <b>information</b> as the impact is greater on performance. <b>Information</b> <b>exchange,</b> <b>information</b> quality, operational information, strategic information, supply chain, performance...|$|R

40|$|Coordination–or the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> among {{physicians}} and hospital staff–is necessary for desirable patient outcomes in healthcare delivery. However, coordination {{is difficult because}} healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i. e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations context–use of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i. e. Electronic Health Records systems) by {{physicians and}} hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employment–influence <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship to provider-patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the U. S. A., we find that increased <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship drives provider-patient communication, and increased social interaction ties drives <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Social interaction ties fully mediates the relationship between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Physician employment amplifies the link between ITDR and social interaction ties, but {{does not have an}} effect on the link between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We do not find a direct relationship between ITDR, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship or provider-patient communication...|$|R

Recent {{internationalisation}} {{effort of}} the Swedish Armed Forces has led to rapidly increased demand on interoperability in general and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in particular. Flexibly composed units involve the building of never complete system. Nevertheless, the challenge of connecting systems turns {{out not to be}} only a matter of technical issues but also semantic (unique interpretation of information) and organisational (<b>information</b> <b>exchanged</b> is efficiently used) ones. In order to provide a domain specific model within a particular context we need an adaptive methodology that deals with how to build an <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> model based upon <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> requirements. By having a uniquely defined method to build the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> models we can provide a timely and resource efficient <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> This paper presents a methodology that is a first step towards meeting the challenges mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Title: <b>Information</b> <b>exchange</b> with {{professionals}} in dementia decision-making: views of informal caregivers Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. The majority lives at home and are largely dependent of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and support. This creates unnecessary stress in informal caregivers. Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> enabling informal caregivers to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of {{professionals in}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> between informal caregivers and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of informal caregivers of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. Informal caregivers were positive about <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of actively involved professionals. The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by informal caregivers with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making, to ensure informal caregivers are equal partners in decision-making...|$|R

This paper investigates the interactions between gender, social capital and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in rural Uganda. Within the framework of farmer-to-farmer models, we conceptualise the informal information diffusion process to comprise social capital accumulation and <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We assume that each agent participates in <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> with a fixed (predetermined) level of social capital and examine how endowments of social capital influence <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> paying close attention to gender differences. A multinomial logit model is used to analyse multiple participation choices of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> facing the farmer. Findings demonstrate that social capital {{is an important factor in}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> with men generally having better access to social capital than women. We also find strong evidence in support of group-based technology dissemination systems. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about conceptualizing {{relationship}} alignment in small firm relationships from an <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> perspective. The thesis has a theoretical focus {{but is also}} informed by three case studies. The thesis is based on five papers dealing with <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> with different focus: inter-organizational <b>information</b> systems, <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> patterns, social <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> coordination of <b>information,</b> concepts for relationship alignment. The context in which <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is examined is small firm relationships. While there are research of information technology in such context on strategic issues of IT alignment, {{there is still a}} great need to find out how the small firm relationship can be aligned from the perspective of ‘working together' with an information focus rather than technology focus. The thesis examine and criticize three sets of theoretical bodies; Social exchange theory, relational theory, and information systems theory in order to understand how relationship alignment may be articulated in a differentiated style. The main conclusion drawn from this work is that relationship alignment between small firms could be expressed by a relationship alignment conceptualization that consists of three different aspects of <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The three aspects of the concept are: presence which is the social dimension of <b>exchanging</b> <b>information,</b> formality which has a transaction focus, and mediation, an information technology concept for <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> Godkänd; 2006; 20070912 (dan_h...|$|R
