Reports from New York City stated that Smith's parents discredited the identification of the corpse. A Smith College friend confirmed that Smith wore a silver retainer to straighten her teeth like the one which authorities found in the mouth of the body. The band extended from the eye teeth on the lower jaw. Smith's dentist also was able to provide her <b>dental</b> <b>fittings</b> which aligned with the corpse.|$|E
40|$|THE {{effects on}} field {{distribution}} of metal objects situated between the electrodes have {{for many years}} {{been a matter of}} concern to those applying short-wave diathermy. These workers have always been aware of the risks of this form of treatment when metal is present in the tissues. The physician who turns to the literature for guidance will find a bewildering mass of conflicting evidence. According to many reports the danger of burning is great. Schliephake (1935), among others, advises the removal of all metallic objects, since they may become unpleasantly heated. This warning was repeated by Bierman (1942), who considered that metallic objects may concentrate the field. Kowarschik (1935) observed heating of metal wires in a short-wave field and also the presence of arcing. He noted, however, that metallic <b>dental</b> <b>fittings</b> in a short-wave field did not appear to cause any difficulties, though he could offer no explanation for this. On the other hand, Etter, Pudenz, and Gersh (1947) claimed that burning occurred only when the energy exceeded the therapeutic range...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{investigate}} the fitting accuracy of Co-Cr dental bridges, manufactured by three technologies, with the newly developed method using CAD software. The four-part dental bridges of Co-Cr alloys were produced by conventional casting of wax models, casting with 3 D printed patterns and selective laser melting. The marginal and internal fit of dental bridges was studied out by two methods – silicone replica test and CAD software. As the silicone replica test characterizes with comparatively low accuracy, a new methodology for investigating the <b>fitting</b> accuracy of <b>dental</b> bridges was developed based on the SolidWorks CAD software. The newly developed method allows {{the study of the}} marginal and internal adaptation in unlimited directions and high accuracy. Investigation the marginal fit and internal adaptation of Co-Cr four-part dental bridges by the two methods show that the technological process strongly influences the <b>fitting</b> accuracy of <b>dental</b> restorations. The <b>fitting</b> accuracy of the bridges, cast with 3 D printed patterns, is the highest, followed by the SLM and conventionally cast bridges. The marginal fit of the three groups of bridges is in the clinically acceptable range. The internal gap values vary in different regions – it is highest on the occlusal surfaces, followed by that in the marginal and axial areas. The higher fitting accuracy of the bridges, manufactured by casting with 3 D printed patterns and SLM, compared to the conventionally cast bridges is a good precondition for their successful implementation in the dental offices and laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim: Dental {{impressions}} {{present a}} negative imprint of intraoral tissues {{of a patient}} which is, by pouring in gypsum, transferred extraorally on the working cast. Casting an accurate and precise working cast presents the first and very important step, since {{each of the following}} stages contributes to the overall error of the production process, which can lead to inadequately <b>fitting</b> <b>dental</b> restorations. The aim {{of this study was to}} promote and test a new model and technique for in vitro evaluation of the dental impression accuracy, as well as to asses the dimensional stability of impression material depending on the material bulk, and its effect on the accuracy of working casts. Methods. Impressions were made by the monophasic technique using the experimental master model. Custom trays with spacing of 1, 2 and 3 mm were constructed by rapid prototyping. The overall of 10 impressions were made with each custom tray. Working casts were made with gypsum type IV. Measurement of working casts was done 24 h later using a co-ordinate measuring machine. Results. The obtained results show that the working casts of all the three custom trays were in most cases significantly different in the transversal and sagittal planes in relation to the master model. The height of abutments was mainly unaffected. The degree of convergence showed certain significance in all the three custom trays, most pronounced in the tray with 3 mm spacing. Conclusion. The impression material bulk of 1 – 3 mm could provide accurate working casts when using the monophasic impression technique. The increase of the distance between abutment teeth influences the accuracy of working casts depending on the material bulk. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Objectives. Stress {{transmission}} to {{the root}} through passive <b>fitting</b> <b>dental</b> posts is partly influenced by {{the thickness of the}} cement layer between the post and the prepared root canal surface as well as the fit of the post in the root canal. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the cement gap between the post surfaces and the root canals using five prefabricated, tapered, unthreaded titanium posts of different manufacturers, without and with cement. Methods. Following the endodontic treatment with hand instruments of 100 intact anterior teeth, post spaces were prepared using opening drills of the corresponding size of post. Fifty posts were cemented with zinc phosphate cement in{{to the root}}s for each system while another 50 posts were inserted into the canal without using the cement. After histological sectioning, the cement gap was measured at six sites for three times at the coronal, middle and apical regions between the root canal wall and the post surface under a light microscope before and after cementation. Results. Before cementation, the highest overall cement gap was observed with the Dr Mooser post system (R) (46 mu m) and the lowest with the Velva post system (R) and Cylindro-Conical system (R) (30 mu m). Significantly less (P 0. 001) compared with Velva-Post (R) (38, 20 mu m) at the coronal and middle part, respectively (Mann-Whitney U-test, Boneferroni correction). Significant differences (P < 0. 001) were observed between the cement gap at the coronal and apical part for the Cylindro-Conical system (R) (79, 46 mu m), Dr Mooser post system (R) (45, 56 mu m) and MP Pirec post system (R) (25, 52 mu m). After cementation, the highest cement gap at the coronal part was obtained with the Cylindro-Conical system (R) (79 +/- 21 mu m) and the lowest with the MP Pirec post system (R) (25 +/- 9 mu m). However, at the apical end, the MP Pirec post system (R) (52 +/- 89 gm) and Dr Mooser post system (R) (56 +/- 16 gm) revealed the highest gap. Significance. Form-congruence between the preparation drill and the post systems exhibited differences. The most consistent cement gap either at the coronal, middle or apical parts of the root canals was obtained with the Erlangen post system (R). (c) 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.

40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 31 -year-old male {{presented}} to the emergency department (ED) with worsening constant left sided throat pain {{over the past four}} months. The patient reports that he was brushing his teeth when his dog jumped onto his back causing his toothbrush to puncture the back of his throat, resulting in immediate bleeding and discomfort. The bleeding subsided and the patient did not seek medical care. The pain radiated to his left ear and the back of the neck. He also noted a change in his voice. The day before presenting to the ED the patient noted subjective fevers, hemoptysis and drooling, which led him to seek medical care. Significant findings: The photograph demonstrates an area of ulcerative tissue at the left palatine tonsil without surrounding erythema or purulent drainage. The computed tomography (CT) scan shows a large ulceration of the left soft palate and palatine tonsil (red arrow). There is no evidence of skull base osteomyelitis. There is suppurative lymphadenopathy with partial left jugular vein compression due to mass effect (yellow highlight). There is mild nasopharyngeal airway narrowing with architectural distortion (blue arrow), but no other evidence of airway obstruction. Discussion: The oral cavity is prone to trauma leading to the formation of superficial ulcerations. There are many causes of mechanical trauma, most commonly accidental biting. Chemical, electrical and thermal insults are also possibilities. Poor <b>fitting</b> <b>dental</b> devices and fractured or malformed teeth can also be etiologies. 1 Traumatic ulcerations are most common in children given bruxism and thumb sucking. However, a broad differential must be considered including malignant and premalignant lesions, infections of the oral mucosa, aphthous ulcerations and autoimmune diseases. 2, 3 Chronic ulcerations are associated with superimposed infection, but there has not been established an association of malignant transformation of the oral mucosa after trauma. If there is an unclear history at presentation, the provider must consider referral for a biopsy to exclude malignancy. Most ulcerations from mechanical or thermal trauma resolve in ten to fourteen days. Antibiotics can be considered to prevent secondary infection if the ulceration is severe; however, most resolve without antibiotics. Supportive measures to consider include removal of irritant, mouth guards, soft diet, sodium chloride mouth rinse, topical corticosteroids or anesthetics. Triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinonide gel are recommended for analgesia. 2 The patient discussed here was discharged home after his visit with a plan to follow up for further evaluation by a specialist. He returned to the emergency department three months later with worsening symptoms. He was admitted and otolaryngology performed biopsies, which demonstrated an advanced stage human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer. The patient is currently in a clinical trial receiving treatment. Again, this stresses the importance of follow up and further evaluation of concerning lesions...|$|R
