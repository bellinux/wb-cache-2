40|$|With {{the cost}} of sludge {{management}} on the rise, the volume reduction of municipal wastewater sludge is becoming an increasingly important issue for wastewater treatment plants. Current research is focused on pretreatment methods intended {{to increase the efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion. Unfortunately, many of the pretreatment methods studied show little to no improvements in dewaterability of the secondary sludge. This research was carried out to investigate the potential of <b>freezing</b> and combined ultrasound-??freezing methods for simultaneous sludge pretreatment and conditioning. Three methods of <b>freezing</b> were employed; conventional freeze-??thaw (FT), combined ultrasonic-??freezing (UF) and progressive ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> (PUF). The solubilisation of sludge organic matter, evaluated by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), showed significant improvements for all <b>freezing</b> methods compared to the controls. The maximum increase in sCOD was 6. 5 times the control for conventional <b>freezing</b> at -?? 30 ?C and 5 freeze-??thaw cycles, 5. 3 times the control for combined ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> at 20 % amplitude and 12 minutes of sonication and 7. 7 times the control for the liquid portion of the progressive ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> samples with a three second sonication pulse {{for the duration of the}} <b>freezing.</b> The dewaterability of the <b>freezing</b> methods was also evaluated by measuring sludge volume index (SVI) and capillary suction time (CST). The three <b>freezing</b> methods showed significant improvements in dewaterability with CST ratios ranging from 0. 12 ? 0. 21 for conventional <b>freezing,</b> 0. 11 -?? 0. 21 for combined ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> and 0. 15 ? 0. 26 for the solid portion of the progressive ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> samples. The <b>freezing</b> methods were compared to three commonly studied pretreatment methods (thermal, microwave and ultrasound) and showed equivalent or better abilities to solubilise sludge organic matter and improve dewaterability. Further tests revealed that the three <b>freezing</b> treatments also resulted in significantly higher concentrations of proteins as well as increased biodegradability and gas production. The gas production ratio over the control was greatest for conventional <b>freezing</b> (1. 52), followed by combined ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> (1. 17) and progressive ultrasonic <b>freezing</b> (1. 13).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. A two layer ocean mixed layer model {{is used to}} study the relationship between onset of <b>freezing</b> and mixed layer depth, wind forcing, surface buoyancy flux, and temperature and salinity changes between the two layers. Universal non- dimensional parameters for stability and surface forcing are derived and related to the maximum <b>freezing</b> rate. Analytic solutions to the model are found {{in terms of the}} universal parameters and the model turbulent mixing tuning constants. Sensitivity studies show the dependence of the <b>freezing</b> rate on the stability as defined by the salinity and temperature jumps, the forcing by wind stress and surface heat flux, and the mixed layer depth. Results show that an increase in heat flux produces a nearly linear increase in the <b>freezing</b> rate. Mixing energy from the wind, proportional to the wind speed cubed, results in a nearly linear decrease in <b>freezing</b> rate. There is a nonlinear relationship between the temperature jump between layers and the <b>freezing</b> rate. Warming of the deeper layer decreases the <b>freezing</b> rate and ultimately prevents <b>freezing.</b> A nonlinear relation was also found between the salinity jump and <b>freezing</b> rate. Increase in the deeper layer salinity causes an increase in the <b>freezing</b> rate and leads to the maximum expected <b>freezing</b> rate.

40|$|Ice {{nucleating}} particles (INPs) in {{the atmosphere}} are responsible for glaciating cloud droplets between 237 and 273  K. Different mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation can compete under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Contact <b>freezing</b> is considered relevant because higher ice nucleation temperatures than for immersion <b>freezing</b> for the same INPs were observed. It has limitations because its efficiency depends {{on the number of}} collisions between cloud droplets and INPs. To date, direct comparisons of contact and immersion <b>freezing</b> with the same INP, for similar residence times and concentrations, are lacking. This study compares immersion and contact <b>freezing</b> efficiencies of three different INPs. The contact <b>freezing</b> data were obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH) using 80  µm diameter droplets, which can interact with INPs for residence times of 2 and 4  s in the chamber. The contact <b>freezing</b> efficiency was calculated by estimating the number of collisions between droplets and particles. Theoretical formulations of collision efficiencies gave too high <b>freezing</b> efficiencies for all investigated INPs, namely AgI particles with 200  nm electrical mobility diameter, 400 and 800  nm diameter Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and kaolinite particles. Comparison of <b>freezing</b> efficiencies by contact and immersion <b>freezing</b> is therefore limited by the accuracy of collision efficiencies. The concentration of particles was 1000  cm − 3 for ATD and kaolinite and 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000  cm − 3 for AgI. For concentrations [*]<[*]  5000  cm − 3, the droplets collect only one particle on average during their time in the chamber. For ATD and kaolinite particles, contact <b>freezing</b> efficiencies at 2  s residence time were smaller than at 4  s, which is in disagreement with a collisional contact <b>freezing</b> process but in accordance with immersion <b>freezing</b> or adhesion <b>freezing.</b> With “adhesion freezing”, we refer to a contact nucleation process that is enhanced compared to immersion <b>freezing</b> due to the position of the INP on the droplet, and we discriminate it from collisional contact <b>freezing,</b> which assumes an enhancement due to the collision of the particle with the droplet. For best comparison with contact <b>freezing</b> results, immersion <b>freezing</b> experiments of the same INPs were performed with the continuous flow diffusion chamber Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber–Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (IMCA–ZINC) for a 3  s residence time. In IMCA–ZINC, each INP is activated into a droplet in IMCA and provides its surface for ice nucleation in the ZINC chamber. The comparison of contact and immersion <b>freezing</b> results did not confirm a general enhancement of <b>freezing</b> efficiency for contact compared with immersion <b>freezing</b> experiments. For AgI particles the onset of heterogeneous <b>freezing</b> in CLINCH was even shifted to lower temperatures compared with IMCA–ZINC. For ATD, <b>freezing</b> efficiencies for contact and immersion <b>freezing</b> experiments were similar. For kaolinite particles, contact <b>freezing</b> became detectable at higher temperatures than immersion <b>freezing.</b> Using contact angle information between water and the INP, it is discussed how the position of the INP in or on the droplets may influence its ice nucleation activity...|$|R

Recent evidences suggest a complex interplay between gait impairment and executive functions. Aim of our study was to evaluate whether specific motor conditions (sitting or walking) influence cognitive performance {{in patients with}} or without different types of <b>freezing.</b> METHODS: Eight healthy controls, eight patients without <b>freezing,</b> nine patients with levodopa-responsive and nine patients with levodopa-resistant <b>freezing</b> received a clinical and neuropsychological assessment during two randomly performed conditions: at rest and during walking. RESULTS: At rest, patients with levodopa-resistant <b>freezing</b> performed worse than patients without <b>freezing</b> on tests of phonological fluency (p = 0. 01). No differences among the four groups were detected during walking. When cognitive performances during walking were compared to the performance at rest, {{there was a significant}} decline of verbal episodic memory task (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) in patients without <b>freezing</b> and with levodopa-responsive <b>freezing.</b> Interestingly, walking improved performance on the phonological fluency task in patients with levodopa-resistant <b>freezing</b> (p = 0. 04).
