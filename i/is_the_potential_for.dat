5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies {{and their impact on}} normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

25|$|While {{dealing with}} the issue of {{internet}} privacy, one must first be concerned with not only the technological implications such as damaged property, corrupted files, and the like, but also with the potential for implications on their real lives. One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 “Internet Security Threat Report” that roughly ninety-three percent of “gateway” attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. It {{should be noted that the}} term “gateway” attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks.|$|E
25|$|Nests of eusocial Hymenoptera {{including}} D. sylvestris {{often have}} conflict between {{workers and the}} queen over production of male eggs. Male eggs can be produced by workers that do not mate because these male eggs {{do not need to}} be fertilized. Both queen and worker share more genes with their own sons than each other’s so they benefit more from producing their own eggs. In nests of tree wasps about half of the male eggs are worker produced so there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> a high level of worker-queen conflict. To help decrease this conflict, eggs that are produced by workers are destroyed in a process known as worker policing. These eggs are eaten by the queen or workers shortly after being produced, but workers almost never police queen laid eggs. Worker policing is known to occur in other wasp species, particularly small colonies with high levels of worker laid eggs.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical {{methods include}} dusting, picking and cutting, and abrading. Mechanical {{cleaning}} is typically {{much easier to}} control than chemical treatments {{and there is no}} danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered {{to the surface of the}} ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate vacuum cleaner with a soft, muslin-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian texts {{typically}} {{treat the}} dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the Coffin Texts and a more explicit one in the Book of the Dead, in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him. Details about this eschatological prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris. Yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> a new creation to arise {{in the same manner as}} the old.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, it expanded, {{and built}} a second plant at Elton, Cheshire, {{creating}} over 550 new jobs. It produces 20 percent of the UK's glass container requirements and provides a glass packaging, filling and distribution service for the drinks industry. The facilities at the plant include a beverage filling hall, warehousing, two glass melting furnaces and 13 production lines. The capacity of the second plant is currently 1.2 billion units, with production capacity of both plants estimated to be 2.4 billion units in 2008. The plant has five lines capable of bottling a total of 400 bottles of wine, or 1,000 bottles of beer a minute. Having manufacturing and bottling on the same site can reduce costs and keep prices competitive. By offering bottling services, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> glass makers to win more business as an overflow plant in times of high demand, and it is as a contract packing operation that the greatest benefits from bottling lines {{are likely to be}} had.
