5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this <b>dissertation</b> was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' <b>dissertation</b> was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou <b>Dissertation</b> sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and analyze Nordic doctoral <b>dissertations</b> in logistics and supply chain management (SCM) published from the years 2009 – 2014. The paper is based on a detailed review of 150 doctoral <b>dissertations.</b> Compared with previous studies, this paper identifies a trend toward: more <b>dissertations</b> based on a collection of articles than monographs; more <b>dissertations</b> focusing on inter-organizational SCM issues; a shift from a focal company perspective to functional aspects and supply chain-related research; and finally, a continued decreased focus on the philosophy of science. A score for measuring the significance of article-based <b>dissertations</b> is also proposed.|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} development {{evidenced in}} the above table is an increased focus on functional themes within <b>dissertations</b> (in the present analysis, this is about 26  % of the <b>dissertations</b> compared with 11 and 10  % in previous analyses). This development is primarily driven by Finnish <b>dissertations</b> and can indicate an emphasis on building stronger knowledge bases in certain sub-disciplines along the supply chain. Examples of such <b>dissertations</b> are [18, 19]. Another interesting development is the reduced focus on firm-level analysis and a subsequent increased focus on the supply chain or the network {{as the level of}} analysis, with the network level experiencing the highest increase. This increase is strongly evident within Swedish <b>dissertations.</b>|$|R
