5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E

5000|$|... “Models {{for police}} {{departments}} {{should be based}} on demographic and community needs.” [...] Each size and location should be specific to the quantity of officers. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that overstaffing was an opportunity for less control as well as less personal contact with civilians. With this, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that assignments should be rotated for career development as well as prevention against stratification in the agency.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that Wicca, {{which had}} been a closed {{tradition}} since the 1950s, should become more open to newcomers.|$|R
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|Zhirinovsky {{supports}} Israel-Russia relations, {{but says}} that Israel {{has to make}} Russian its official language. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that Israel has {{to pay more attention}} to the Russian Orthodox Church.

25|$|Jan 24, 2007: Writing for Global Research, General Leonid Ivashov, vice {{president}} of the Academy on Geopolitical Affairs and former Joint Chief of Staff of the Russian Armies, forecasts an American nuclear attack on Iran by the end of April. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes,</b> like Scott Ritter, that the US will use tactical nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, Palast said he'd {{received}} 500 emails {{that former}} White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove exchanged through an account {{supplied by the}} Republican National Committee. Palast says the emails show a plan to target likely Democratic voters with extra scrutiny over their home addresses, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> Rove's plan {{was a factor in}} the firing of U.S. Attorneys.|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{supports}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act {{and believes that}} it brings us closer to giving Americans a sense of financial security. Although he voices strong support, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that legislation should be passed that adds a public option to the insurance mandate and repeals the ban on the government negotiating for lower drug prices. Lessig has proposed prize funding drug research and banning drug companies from negotiating with generic drug providers to delay entry into the market.|$|E

25|$|Even Hyun Jin Kim, who {{argues for}} a Hunnish victory, {{thinks that the}} battle had a major outcome {{on the future of}} Roman Gaul. First, he debunks the claims that it was a {{religious}} and cultural victory over the Huns of Central Asia. Kim argues that the battle significantly weakened the military capacity of the Alans, Visigoths, and the Romans, which allowed for Frankish and Burgundian hegemony in North Gaul. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that it set up the career of Odoacer, who would later found his own Kingdom in Italy after deposing the last Western Roman Emperor and submitting to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|He dismisses {{both the}} notion that the {{strategy}} will trigger an invasion by the Chinese government and {{the notion that}} Taiwan benefits economically by developing economic ties with China. He argues the People's Republic of China is a paper tiger and both its military strength and economic strength have been far overestimated. Lee asserts that when presented with a united and assertive Taiwan, Taiwan will receive support from the international community and also from the United States and that the PRC will be obliged to back down. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that the PRC economy is doomed to collapse and that unlimited integration with the PRC economy, on the part of Taiwan or any country, is unwise.|$|E
25|$|Former NFL coach Tony Dungy {{later told}} Profootballtalk.com {{he was certain}} that Williams {{operated}} a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.|$|E

50|$|Mesmerism, {{also called}} animal magnetism, {{is the term}} given by Frank Mesmer for what he {{believed}} to be an invisible natural force in animals. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> {{that it could have}} physical effects such as healing.|$|R
25|$|Rubio {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq and {{military intervention in}} Libya. Rubio voiced support for a Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Iran-backed Shia Houthis. Regarding Iran, he supports tough sanctions, and scrapping the recent nuclear deal; on the Islamic State, he favors aiding local Sunni forces in Iraq and Syria. Rubio says that the United States cannot accept more Syrian refugees because background checks cannot be done under present circumstances. He supports working with allies to set up no-fly zones in Syria to protect civilians from Bashar al-Assad. He favors collection of bulk metadata for purposes of national security. He has said that gun control laws consistently fail to achieve their purpose and as of 2017 had received $3,303,355 in donations from the National Rifle Association. He is supportive of the Trans Pacific Partnership, saying that the U.S. risks being excluded from global trade unless it is more open to trade. He is wary of China regarding national security and human rights, and wants to boost the U.S. military presence in that region but hopes for greater economic growth {{as a result of}} trading with that country. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> the U.S. should support democracy, freedom, and true autonomy of the people of Hong Kong. On capital punishment, Rubio favors streamlining the appeals process.|$|E
500|$|<b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that {{in order}} to improve the {{competitive}} advantage of Taiwan, the government should review the distribution of resources between northern and southern Taiwan, with the purpose of balancing their development. Hsu, {{as a member of the}} Democratic Progressive Party, also supports the independence movement of Taiwan. Hsu thinks that the United Nations membership referendum is an important step for democracy. He participated in the [...] "UN for Taiwan" [...] rally on September 15, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Aden's main enemy {{throughout}} his duration is Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis). Aden {{did not like}} Geoff because he is talented at football. As Geoff is a strict Christian, Aden sees Geoff representing the [...] "hypocrisy of society". <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> Geoff is as [...] "full of sin" [...] and [...] "flawed" [...] as everyone else. While their characters clashed on-screen Lasance and Lewis were close friends in real life and learned lines together while they critiqued each other's performances.|$|E

25|$|Samuel Guthrie, an American {{physician}} from Sackets Harbor, New York, {{also appears}} to have produced chloroform in 1831 by reacting chlorinated lime with ethanol, as well as noting its anaesthetic properties; however, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that <b>he</b> had prepared chloric ether.|$|R
500|$|Stevenson {{believed}} that 'black and dismal' was {{a translation of}} the name, noting that [...] "as usual, in Gaelic, {{it is not the}} only one." [...] Adamnan in his 7th-century Life of St Columba poetically calls the rock An Dubh Iar-stac, [...] "The Black Stack of the West". Watson (1926) suggests the root is Old Irish hirt meaning [...] "death", (which <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> occurs in Hirta, the main island of the St Kilda archipelago), and offers am Duibh-hirteach, meaning [...] "the black deadly one". The skerry was also known as St. John's Rock prior to the construction of the lighthouse.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{shares a}} sibling rivalry with his younger sister, Lisa, {{but has a}} buddy-like {{relationship}} with his youngest sister Maggie, due to her infant state. While Bart has often hurt Lisa, and even fought her physically, the two are often very close. Bart cares for Lisa deeply and has always apologized for going too far. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> Lisa to be his superior {{when it comes to}} solving problems and frequently goes to her for advice. Bart is also highly protective of Lisa: When a bully destroys her box of cupcakes in [...] "Bart the General", (season one, 1990), Bart immediately stands up for her.|$|E
500|$|Kagame {{has been}} vocal in his praise of China and its model for {{relations}} with Africa, {{saying in a}} 2009 interview that [...] "the Chinese bring what Africa needs: investment and money for governments and companies." [...] This {{is in contrast to}} Western countries, whom Kagame accuses of focussing too heavily on giving aid to the continent rather than building a trading relationship; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>believes</b> that they keep African products out of the world marketplace by the use of high tariffs. China does not involve itself in the domestic affairs of the countries with which it trades, hence has not followed the West in criticising Kagame's alleged involvement in the war in the Congo.|$|E
50|$|Ranil Wickremesinghe {{believed}} {{a political solution}} based on a United Sri Lanka was the permanent solution to the Ethnic Problem in Sri Lanka. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that such a solution could be reached through a peaceful negotiation process with LTTE.|$|R
