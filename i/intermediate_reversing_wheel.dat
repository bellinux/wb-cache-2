40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an experimental investigation {{made of the}} applied ground loads and the coefficient of friction between the tire and the ground during the wheel spin-up process in impacts of a small landing gear under controlled conditions on a concrete landing strip in the Langley impact basin. The basic investigation included three major phases: impacts with forward speed at horizontal velocities up to approximately 86 feet per second, impacts with forward speed and <b>reverse</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation to simulate horizontal velocities up to about 273 feet per second, and spin-up drop tests for comparison with the other tests. In addition to the basic investigation, supplementary tests were made to evaluate the drag-load alleviating effects of prerotating the wheel before impact so as to reduce the relative velocity between the tire and ground. In {{the presentation of the}} results, an attempt has been made to interpret the experimental data so as to obtain some insight into the physical phenomena involved in the wheel spin-up process...|$|R
5000|$|In 1944, the LMS re-gauged {{a pair of}} [...] "Jinty" [...] 0-6-0 tank {{locomotives}} - originally {{built to}} UK [...] - for use on its [...] gauge Northern Counties Committee (NCC) lines in Northern Ireland; re-designated as Class Y, they largely undertook shunting work on dockyard lines in Belfast.

5000|$|The engines were reboilered by the LMS in 1944, {{just before}} {{delivery}} to the NCC in August. The conversion to [...] gauge was simply done by <b>reversing</b> the <b>wheels</b> and renewing the tyres and crank pins.

5000|$|In the Middle Ages {{until the}} start of the Early Modern Period the ore was broken up above ground using sledges and sorted by hand into silver, lead and copper ores and gangue. The {{pounding}} stones (Pochsteine) or stamps used have occasionally been found in recent times during archaeological excavations. The use of water power increased {{around the turn of the}} 16th and 17th centuries and it began to be employed in processing to enrich the ore concentration. On the one hand water was used as an energy source; on the other it was used to wash out the unwanted clay and to separate ore from gangue by making use of the different density of the minerals. The tailings from the washing process were simply emptied into the rivers of the Harz along with the used driving water. The low efficiency of the first ore processing machines resulted in a high content of heavy metals in the rivers. As a consequence of using the aforementioned water-based method of processing the stamp mills (Pochwerke) were located in the deeper river valleys. As a rule, they obtained water from the pits, where it had been used to drive water <b>wheels</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>wheels.</b> Until the beginning of the industrial era, mechanical processing was carried out as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Missiles 63D and 84D on September 9 and 11 lost thrust {{and tumbled}} during the {{sustainer}} phase, {{in the first}} case due to a ruptured vernier hydraulic line, in the second due to thrust section overheating. On October 7, Missile 163D exploded at T+75 seconds when the <b>intermediate</b> bulkhead <b>reversed.</b> Postflight investigation found that launch crews had loaded the helium bottles with insufficiently chilled gas, resulting in a lack of helium flow to the propellant tanks, which lost pressure during ascent.|$|R

When the Elsinore {{was up in}} the eye of the wind, {{and making}} sternway, I found that by putting the wheel sharply over, one way or the other, I could swing her bow off. Then, when she had paid off till the wind was abeam, by <b>reversing</b> the <b>wheel</b> hard across to the opposite hard-over I could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it. This made all the wood-floated triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.|$|R
50|$|Transposable {{elements}} are pieces of genetic material that {{are capable of}} splicing themselves into a host genome and then self propagating throughout the genome, much like a virus. Retrotransposons are a subset of transposable elements that use an RNA <b>intermediate</b> and <b>reverse</b> transcribe themselves into the genome. Retrotransposon proliferation may lead to insertional mutagenesis, disrupt the process of DNA repair, or cause errors during chromosomal crossover, and so it is advantageous for an organism to possess the means to suppress or “silence” retrotransposon activity.|$|R

50|$|Retroviruses {{were shown}} to have a {{single-stranded}} RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA <b>intermediate,</b> the <b>reverse</b> of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several {{that are associated with}} cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to molecular cloning and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|$|R

40|$|AbstractReverse {{transcription}} is {{not solely}} a retroviral mechanism. Hepadnaviruses and caulimoviruses have RNA <b>intermediates</b> that are <b>reverse</b> transcribed into DNA.

50|$|SINEs use an RNA <b>intermediate</b> and <b>reverse</b> {{transcriptase}} to transpose {{into new}} {{parts of the}} genome. SINEs do not encode a functional reverse transcriptase and {{have to rely on}} the molecular machinery of other TEs for transposition. SINEs and other nuclear elements rely on the LINE-1 (L1) proteins for transposition throughout the genome. L1 is transcribed and retrotransposed most frequently in the germ-line and during early development; as a result SINEs move around the genome most during these periods. SINE transcription is down-regulated by transcription factors in somatic cells after early development, though stress can cause up-regulation of normally silent SINEs. SINEs can be transferred between individuals or species via horizontal transfer though a viral vector.|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is of {{the most}} common {{pathogens}} that infect human and non-human primates, and which may cause either acute or chronic infection. The uniquity of the HBV virus {{lies in the fact that}} it possesses a partially double-stranded DNA genome and the virus life cycle contains an <b>intermediate</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription stage catalyzed by the viral reverse transcriptase. Because of this and the ability of the virus to recombine, HBV exhibits a wide range of genetic heterogeneity. The global distribution of HBV genotypes as described by molecular epidemiology shows that there is a specific geographic model which is probably associated with the models of transmission and, mainly, with the origin and the evolutionary history of the virus. As far as the scenario of zoonosis is concerned, it should be noted that HBV has been isolated from non-human primates but not from old world monkeys. Regarding the association between genotype and phenotype, other differences have been observed as far as the prevalence of mutations which are connected with important viral biological properties are concerned, such as precore mutants and basal core promoter mutants. There are also explicit indications that recombination affects the biological properties of HBV, since recombinant strains possess properties which constitute a combination of the properties of the parental strains. HBV genotypes, apart from genomic differences, also appear to differ considerably also in their biological properties. HBV genotypes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B, in the responses to antiretroviral therapy, such as the manifestation of hepatic cirrhosis and the evolution to hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the response to treatment with interferon.
