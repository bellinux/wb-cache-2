40|$|Abstract. As head-disk {{clearance}} {{has been}} reduced to nearly 1 nm, air bearing slider dynamic stability becomes increasingly important. This paper presents an experimental study about the coupling effects of Head Gimbal Assembly (HGA) dynamics and arm vibration on Head Disk Interaction (HDI). HDI dynamics was evaluated on a disc with defect. It was found that a much bigger vibration of the slider was observed when suspension local bending mode and arm bending mode are closed to each other than the situation that the two modes are separated. It is proved that both HGA and arm are related to HDI dynamics in a <b>hard</b> <b>disc</b> <b>drive.</b> This study is helpful to characterize system dynamics for robust HDI design...|$|E
40|$|Negative ion {{formation}} in the three perfluoroethers (PFEs) diglyme (C 6 F 14 O 3), triglyme (C 8 F 18 O 4) and crownether (C 10 F 20 O 5) is studied following electron attachment {{in the range from}} ∼ 0 to 15  eV. All three compounds show intense low energy resonances at subexcitation energies (< 3  eV) decomposing into a variety of negatively charged fragments. These fragment ions are generated via dissociative electron attachment (DEA), partly originating from sequential decompositions on the metastable (μs) time scale as observed from the MIKE (metastable induced kinetic energy) scans. Only in perfluorocrownether a signal due to the non-decomposed parent anion is observed. Additional and comparatively weaker resonances are located in the energy range between ∼ 10 and 17  eV which preferentially decompose into lighter ions. It is suggested that specific features of perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) relevant in applications, e. g., the strong bonding to surfaces induced by UV radiation of the substrate or degradation of PFPE films in computer <b>hard</b> <b>disc</b> <b>drives</b> can be explained by their pronounced sensitivity towards low energy electrons...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} to use {{additional}} actuators to keep vibrating electromechanical systems without rigid connection to the inertial frame, e. g. cameras or <b>hard</b> <b>disc</b> <b>drives,</b> in position. In this paper we investigate an arrangement where a modified piezoelectric bending plate is used for position stabilization. In precision and microsystems engineering such plate transducers are used for transduction of volume flows or pressures. Other applications {{can be found in}} medical devices. The transducer is placed inside a closed capsule providing two air cavities in its front and back. A concentrated mass element connected to the plate supports the stabilization. Based on already existing network approaches the piezoelectric plate transducer model has been developed into a new multi domain network model. The network model further involves electrical, mechanical and acoustical properties of the enclosed transducer. Interactions between the transducer and the surrounding capsule have also been modeled in an acoustical network. The influence of size and numbers of holes in the plate on the electromechanical and acoustical properties of the transducer was investigated and optimized by network simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{relaxation}} {{mechanisms in}} thin nickel films are investigated with all optical pump-probe experiments. Magnetic oscillations in the GHz range {{can be attributed}} to the uniform precession (Kittel mode) and spin waves with dipole character (Damon-Eshbach surface modes). Applying an external field changes both oscillation amplitude and frequency yielding experimental dispersions ν(Hext). On a wedge-shaped nickel sample we discuss i) the merging of Damon-Eshbach with the Kittel mode at a critical field as well as ii) the thickness dependence of the wave vector for magnetostatic surface waves. The signature of a non-linear interaction of modes is found such that the energy pumped into dipolar surface modes is transferred to the Kittel mode and the relaxation amplitude resonantly increases at mode crossings. Modern <b>hard</b> <b>disc</b> <b>drives</b> read and write data at rates of 1 Gbit s− 1 or higher and read/write cycles approach timescales in the nanosecond regime.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the {{continuous sampling plan}} CSP- 100 that was developed from the continuous sampling plans CSP- 1, CSP- 4 and CSP-C. The objective {{of this paper is}} to apply the continuous sampling plan for the new CSP- 100 plan proving a reduction in the delivery inspection time compared to the single lot sampling plan (SSP) while maintaining the same or greater quality conformance. This CSP- 100 was studied in <b>Hard</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Drive</b> manufacturing. The parameters used in the CSP- 100 plan are as follows; i (the number of consecutive conforming units), f (the sampling frequency of partial number in 100 % inspected units) and c (the acceptance number). CSP- 100 computes four performance measures, Average Fraction Inspected (AFI), Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ), Lot Acceptance Rate (LAR) and Defective Parts Per Million (DPPM). The advantage of this CSP- 100 plan is not only to reduce the inspection time but also prove higher productivity numbers when compared with SSP. The verified results of using the CSP- 100 plan proved a reduced inspection time of 6, 722, 702 minutes or 15 % compared to SSP. CSP- 100 also eliminates the work stations and transportation processes due to the inspection area and inspectors are no longer required. The Function Out of Box Audit (FOBA) is introduced to monitor the CSP- 100 performance. The FOBA audit results confirm that the CSP- 100 maintains the same good quality level as the SSP. The excellent results of implementing the CSP- 100 show a reduction in the inspection cost by 3, 693, 730. 04 baht or 60. 40 % compared to SSP, as well as the additional cost savings by no longer needing to purchase a new tester; a savings of ~ 44 million baht. The CSP- 100 plan also eliminates the issue of delayed delivery that is part of the SSP process. Moreover it is a better choice in inspecting the continuous quality process in <b>Hard</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Drive</b> manufacturing...|$|E

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industries, process {{variation is}} known to be a major source of poor quality. As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two or more correlated variables (multivariate). The traditional statistical process control (SPC) charting schemes are known to be effective in monitoring aspect but nevertheless, they are lack of diagnosis. In recent years, the control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) schemes have been developed for solving this issue. Design consideration involved the modeling of manufacturing process data to select input representation based on raw data.
