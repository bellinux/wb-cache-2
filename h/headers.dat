He was not utilised by Eddie Gray, but instead made his debut as a forward under Billy Bremner on 14 October 1985, in a Full Members Cup defeat to Manchester City at Maine Road. He won his first Football League start on 1 January 1986, playing alongside Neil Aspin in a Second Division fixture against Oldham Athletic.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from <b>headers.</b> São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic <b>headers</b> that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{continued}} to press forward following their goal. Carroll found Gerrard with a headed {{pass in the}} 71st minute, but Gerrard's shot went over the crossbar. Two minutes later a shot by Suárez was saved by Čech and out for a Liverpool corner, but Agger's header from the resulting corner went wide. Carroll {{had a number of}} chances in the subsequent minutes, but none of his <b>headers</b> were on target. Chelsea replaced goalscorer Ramires with midfielder Raul Meireles in the 76th minute and a minute later Bellamy was replaced by Dirk Kuyt for Liverpool. A minute after the substitution Suárez worked his way into the Chelsea half, his pass to Kuyt was cleared, but it fell to Henderson, whose shot went over the Chelsea goal. Carroll thought he equalised in the 81st minute when his header from a Suárez cross was then palmed by Čech onto the underside of the bar and away to safety. Carroll ran away celebrating his second goal, but after consulting with his assistant, referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal. Replays of the incident remain ambiguous. Liverpool {{continued to}} push forward for the equaliser in the closing minutes, but they were unable to score and the match finished 2–1 to Chelsea.|$|E

After struggling to affirm {{a place in the}} team, he was released by Alfreton on 28 January 2009. He signed for North Ferriby United of the Northern Premier League Premier Division, and made his debut as a 65th-minute substitute in a 4–0 away defeat to Nantwich Town on 28 February 2009. Fortune-West joined Northern Premier League Division One South club Goole in July 2009, debuting in a 1–1 home draw with Carlton Town on 15 August 2009. In November 2010, he joined Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Armthorpe Welfare.

On 16 February, Campbell scored two goals on his home debut against Bristol City in the Severnside derby, which was then followed by another two against Wolverhampton Wanderers the following week. Campbell was named as the Championship's Player of the Month for February 2013 after scoring all of Cardiff's five goals during the month. On {{the last day of the}} Championship title-winning season, Campbell scored in a 2–2 draw with his former club Hull, taking his final season tally for the Cardiff to seven goals in twelve appearances.

5|$|Shopham Lock {{was another}} where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge {{at the tail}} of the lock is built from red and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the {{construction}} of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey <b>headers</b> and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811-12.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{traditional}} format for email <b>header</b> section allows non-ASCII characters {{to be included}} in the value portion of some of the <b>header</b> fields using MIME-encoded words (e.g. in display names or in a Subject <b>header</b> field), MIME-encoding must not be used to encode other information in a <b>header,</b> such as an email address, or <b>header</b> fields like Message-ID or Received. Moreover, the MIME-encoding requires extra processing of the <b>header</b> to convert the data to and from its MIME-encoded word representation, and harms readability of a <b>header</b> section. Including Unicode characters in a <b>header</b> section using UTF-8 encoding eliminates these limitations and also the need to transmit additional encoding and character set information, as UTF-8 encoding will be assumed implicitly.|$|R

In York's 3–1 away win over bottom-placed Hartlepool United the home team took the lead through Scott Fenwick in the first half, before Lowe scored two <b>headers</b> in the space of two minutes and Hyde scored with a shot from outside the penalty area in the second half. Cisak's loan was extended, having conceded just three goals in four {{appearances}}, while De Girolamo rejoined on a second youth loan, both until 4 January 2015.

5|$|Critchell's loan at York was {{extended}} {{for a second}} month, with the fitness of several York defenders in doubt. York were beaten 1–0 away by Mansfield, courtesy of a Robert Duffy penalty, in the teams' fourth encounter of the season. A 13–12 penalty shoot-out victory over Kidderminster followed a 1–1 extra time draw in an FA Trophy replay; in normal time, McBreen scored a header from a corner delivered by Simon Rusk before the away team equalised shortly after through Justin Richards. A new record for the most consecutive penalties scored in a shoot-out was set, at 25. McBreen {{was reported to have}} signed for North Queensland Fury of the A-League, although the transfer had yet to be confirmed by York. It was confirmed that he would join the Fury for the start of 2009–10 in August 2009. Former Wrexham defender Shaun Pejic signed after a successful trial at the club. York beat Conference South team Havant & Waterlooville 2–0 at home in the fourth round of the FA Trophy to secure a place in the semi-final, with both goals scored by McBreen. This was followed by a 2–0 away defeat to Rushden in the league.
