40|$|A {{new process}} has been {{developed}} to obtain high density epitaxial diamond nucleation via a double bias-assisted <b>hot</b> <b>filament</b> chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In the process, a negative bias voltage {{is applied to the}} Si substrate and a positive bias voltage is applied to a steel grid placed on top of the <b>hot</b> <b>filaments.</b> With this arrangement, a stable plasma can be generated between the grid and the <b>hot</b> <b>filaments.</b> Ions in the plasma are then drawn to the substrate by a negative substrate bias voltage. The impinging rate of these ions can be easily controlled by adjusting the grid current, and the ion energy can be independently controlled by adjusting the substrate bias voltage. Hence, the energy and dosage of ion bombardment onto the Si(100) substrate can be controlled easily and independently. With the controlled ion bombardment, high density and heteroepitaxial nucleation can be achieved routinely. After the nucleation process, highly textured diamond films were grown by either the HFCVD or the microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition process (MPCVD). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

By widely varying {{the power of the}} different activation sources of the gas (plasma, <b>hot</b> <b>filaments,</b> substrate heating) while keeping identical the substrate temperature (973 K) and the catalyst preparation, the results point out the important role of ions in the nucleation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as well as the etching behaviour of highly activated radicals such as H˙ in the selective growth of vertically aligned films of CNTs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that, within the deposition conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rate) used in this study, oriented carbon nanotubes can be grown only when both ions, mainly generated by the gas discharge plasma, and highly reactive radicals, mainly formed by the <b>hot</b> <b>filaments,</b> are produced in the gas phase.
