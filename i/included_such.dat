5|$|After {{structural}} design on alternate body styles encountered obstacles, Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with entry level models priced at $1850, undercutting GM's Chevrolet Vega and directly targeting imported models — which <b>included</b> <b>such</b> new competitors as the Mazda 1200 in 1971, the Subaru DL in 1972, and the Honda Civic in 1973.|$|E
5|$|As a {{key figure}} of the Restoration administration, William Bruce became close to other Stuart loyalists, who <b>included</b> <b>such</b> {{powerful}} patrons as the Duke of Lauderdale, Lord Haltoun, and the Earl of Rothes. In 1667, he undertook his first building work for Lord Rothes, overseeing the extensions to Leslie House, and later worked on several of Lauderdale's properties, concurrently with Holyroodhouse. In 1668 he was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia.|$|E

The opening acts in Europe varied, and <b>included</b> <b>such</b> acts as Iggy Pop, Big Country, The Cult, Erasure, The Stranglers and Nina Hagen. The tour also played festival dates, on one occasion with The Eurythmics headlining one night and Bowie headlining the next.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes <b>included</b> <b>such</b> rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were <b>included</b> <b>such</b> as the phoenix, dragon and manticore {{as well as}} cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which <b>included</b> <b>such</b> figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E
5|$|Nichols was {{instructed}} to write the film for Hepburn, {{with whom he had}} worked on John Ford's Mary of Scotland in 1936. Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford. Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film <b>included</b> <b>such</b> members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.|$|E

5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a {{building}} permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike {{some of the other}} developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents <b>included</b> <b>such</b> prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E

The deal, which <b>included</b> <b>such</b> Disney films as The Lion King, Aladdin and Toy Story, came {{at the height of}} Disney's commercial rebirth. Accompanied with the new BK Kid's Club program, the company saw an impressive growth within the children's market. The company's new Kid's Club, its first major foray into a children's targeted ad campaign since the Burger King/Burger King Kingdom program of the 1970s, saw phenomenal growth with more than one million children signing up for the program within two months of its introduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and <b>included</b> <b>such</b> techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that <b>included</b> <b>such</b> {{mainstream}} stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also <b>included,</b> <b>such</b> as digital logs which scatter {{in the direction of}} the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief <b>included</b> <b>such</b> commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Dmowski, {{increasingly}} {{convinced of}} Russia's impending defeat, decided that {{to support the}} cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western Allies. During his lobbying efforts, his friends <b>included</b> <b>such</b> opinion makers as the British journalist Wickham Steed. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favorable impression on public opinion. He gave a series of lecture at Cambridge University, which impressed the local faculty enough that {{he was given a}} honorary doctorate. In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new Polish National Committee aimed at rebuilding a Polish state. That year he also published, at his own expense, Problems of Central and Eastern Europe, that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats. He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned {{for the creation of a}} number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, Hungarians and Romanians) in its place. Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a Regency Kingdom of Poland, with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus lambei and L. magnicristatus, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{were members of}} a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals that <b>included</b> <b>such</b> well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms. The anatomically similar L. lambei, L. magnicristatus, and Corythosaurus were separated by time within the formation, based on stratigraphy. Corythosaurus fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, L. lambei fossils {{are present in the}} upper third, and L. magnicristatus remains are rare and present only at the very top, where the marine influence was greater.|$|E
5|$|The Mesolithic {{lasted from}} 9000 BCE (rapid climate warming) to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It {{was the last}} period when the food {{production}} economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation {{of plant and animal}} material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was even more important than hunting. Mesolithic human settlements became quite numerous {{and by the end of}} this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of Świętokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and <b>included</b> <b>such</b> fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later Mesolithic, the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in Janisławice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.|$|E
