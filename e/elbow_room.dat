It effectively ended the Indian central government's monopoly over the mining of coal, which existed since nationalization in 1973 through socialist controls.

500|$|Far more probable, {{according}} to the archaeological evidence available, is that Carausius probably had held some important military post in Britain and had already a firm basis of power on both Britain and Northern Gaul (a coin hoard found in Rouen proves {{that he was in}} control of that mainland area {{at the beginning of his}} rebellion) and that he profited from the lack of legitimacy of the central government.

500|$|The Missouri {{crisis of}} 1819–1821 {{sharpened}} commitments to expansionism among the country's slaveholding interests, when the so-called Thomas proviso established the 36°30' parallel, imposing free-soil and slave-soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands. While {{a majority of}} southern congressmen acquiesced {{to the exclusion of}} slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, a significant minority objected. Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer predicted that with the proviso restrictions, the South would ultimately require Texas: [...] "If we are cooped up on the north, we must have <b>elbow</b> <b>room</b> to the west." [...] Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti-slavery advocates, and so depriving the South of additional slave states.

5000|$|Yet analysts (and Wegner himself) {{have pointed}} out that, for the artist, color is often a path to other topics.

More than a decade earlier, Meltzer linked his use of color with market mechanisms. She wrote of the paint chip works that “there is always the problem of capital and its ideological effects. After all the paint chip is an advertising tool—a ploy {{to make a buck}} on a dream. Wegner’s work makes these systems palpable, not through barefaced institutional critique, but by quietly <b>elbowing</b> some <b>room</b> into their rigid structures or—as he says in his book The Other Today Is the One You Want (2002)—by ‘opening up the space between the lines’ and ‘pushing back the horizon.’” ...|$|R
2500|$|In <b>Elbow</b> <b>Room,</b> Dennett {{presents}} {{an argument for}} a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book Freedom Evolves.

The only well-defined things are [...] "expectations". The ability to do [...] "otherwise" [...] only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the original}} Piperjet was designed using the Piper Meridian single-engine turboprop as a template.

According to Piper CEO Geoffrey Berger, [...] "We wanted to give our jet customers an even roomier light jet that incorporates a scalable design, {{paving the way for}} a future family of competitive business jets,". The new fuselage design provided an additional 4inches of headroom and nine more inches of <b>elbow</b> <b>room</b> and does away with a hump in the cabin floor that accommodated the wing spar in the old design.|$|E
2500|$|This issue may be {{controversial}} for good reason: There is {{evidence to suggest}} that people normally associate a belief in free will with their ability to affect their lives. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, author of <b>Elbow</b> <b>Room</b> and a supporter of deterministic free will, believes scientists risk making a serious mistake. He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of [...] "free will" [...] are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also [...] "believing in free will"), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Confederacy, Polish foreign labor was desired to work on Southern farms as replacements for black slaves. Several such societies were founded in Texas, largely by private planters, but in 1871, Texas funded immigration of Europeans through direct state aid (Texas Bureau of Immigration). The Waverly Emigration Society, formed in 1867 in Walker County, Texas, by several planters, dispatched Meyer Levy, a Polish Jew, to Poland to acquire roughly 150 Poles to pick cotton. He sailed to Poland and brought back farm laborers, who arrived in New Waverly, Texas, in May 1867. The agreement the Poles had with the plantation owners was that the farmers would be paid $90 (...) , $100 ($), and $110 ($) per year for three years of their labor, while the owners provided them with a [...] "comfortable cabin" [...] and food. Poles paid back their owners for the ship tickets to America, often in installments. By 1900, after years working on Southerners' farms, Poles had [...] "bought almost all the farmland" [...] in New Waverly, and were expanding their land ownership to the surrounding areas. New Waverly served as a mother colony for future Polish immigrants to the United States, as many arriving Poles lived and worked there before moving on to other Polonias in the U.S. Polish farmers commonly worked directly with southern blacks in east Texas, and they were commonly in direct competition for agricultural jobs. Blacks frequently picked up a few words of Polish and Poles picked up some of the black English dialect in these areas during the late 19th century. R. L. Daniels in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine wrote a piece on [...] "Polanders" [...] in Texas in 1888, praising their industriousness and hard work ethic. He cited instances where Polish farmers called their landlords , denoting a subordinate position on level with slavery, and, when asking a woman why she left Poland, she replied 'Mudder haf much childs and 'Nough not to eat all". Daniels found that the Poles were efficient farmers, and planted corn and cotton so close to their homes as not to leave even <b>elbow</b> <b>room</b> to the nearby buildings.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the ethical difficulties {{presented by the}} United Nations “Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights”. Initially, the Biblical principles regarding entering into covenant are elucidated. Next, the United Nations’ role in initiating global covenants is investigated {{in terms of what}} this body premises its mandate on. To follow is this particular covenant, presented as a case study. The weakness in the United Nations’ approach to treaties and covenants is that the bedrock on which such covenants is being established is notably and necessarily absent. This means that terminology, phrases and application ipso facto are determined on the basis of human presuppositions, rather than on the metaphysically implanted principles of God. Herein lies the basic flaw to what appears on the surface to be a noble approach. In a global setting, with many different worldviews <b>elbowing</b> for <b>room,</b> harmonised application of generically applauded concepts is difficult. The moment a generic concept such as “freedom” needs to be handled, it becomes value-laden. The question is then by whose values this concept is going to be handled. Usually, when consensus cannot be reached, majority will rule. This means that the very sovereignty of member states, supposedly safeguarded in the covenant, is being eroded. For Christians, majority rule is not an acceptable modus operandi. The Christian would support the principled approach to ethical issues. However, where the ethical basis is not articulated, the plethora of opinions (collective or individual) is left to act by. This creates a difficult political environment, for which a solution is hard to find. Yet, the Christian must continue to strive to honour his Lord by striving to be “light and salt” in this political scene...|$|R
