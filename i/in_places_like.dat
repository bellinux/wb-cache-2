5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, Jos√© Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots.

He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to heavy rain, high winds were reported. In Palm Springs, wind gusts {{were reported as}} high as 60mph (95km/h). As a result, several trees were felled and power outages occurred. Highway 86 and 111 were under water from Brawley, near the Mexican border to the Salton Sea. California State Route 98 was also flooded from Brawley to Blythe. Two of the four lanes on Interstate 15 were washed out from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, stranding thousands of gamblers <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Barstow. Ocotillo, a town that was devastated during Hurricane Kathleen in 1976, was flooded again. Buses were sent to evacuate the townspeople, but the residents declined to evacuate. Overall, damage totaled $25 million, mostly in agricultural losses in San Diego and Imperial Counties. Eight deaths were reported. Six children were swept away in the Los Angeles River. Five of them were rescued, but the sixth was later presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|Nasr was a {{military}} leader with long service and experience in Khurasan. As early as 705 he participated in a campaign along the upper Oxus River, led by Salih, the brother of Qutayba ibn Muslim, the general who had been tasked with subduing Transoxiana. For his service during this campaign, Nasr was awarded an entire village in this region. Despite the successes of Qutayba, much of Central Asia east of the Oxus remained outside effective Arab control; while garrisons had been established <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Samarkand, Balkh, or Bukhara, the Caliphate largely relied on cliental relationships with the multitude of local rulers, who became tributary to the Umayyads. In addition, clashes with the Chinese-backed Turgesh, the ambiguous policy followed regarding conversion of the native population (mass conversions would lessen the taxable population and hence the amount of tribute received) and increasing inter-Arab tribal factionalism weakened Umayyad control over the region and necessitated increased military activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Nanking had not {{led to the}} {{surrender}} of the Nationalist Government as Matsui had predicted and the war with China continued. Undeterred, Matsui began planning out new military operations <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Xuzhou and Zhejiang Province soon after he had returned to Shanghai. The other big task occupying his time in January and February 1938 was his plan {{to establish a new}} Chinese government in Central China. Matsui was bound and determined to press forward with his ambition to found a new regime to rival Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, and though he did not finish the job before leaving office, the Reformed Government of the Republic of China would eventually come into being in March 1938. However, the leaders of Japan's Army General Staff showed scant interest in his plan to create a new government in China and they also repeatedly refused to approve any new military campaigns under his command. By the beginning of February Matsui was contemplating suicide to protest their lack of enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|The news of {{the fall}} of Kilinochchi to the Sri Lankan Military {{resulted}} in celebration, including gathering on the streets and lighting firecrackers, <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Ampara and Kalutara. The Government of Sri Lanka claimed that the population in Jaffna celebrated the capture by raising the national flag with anti-LTTE slogans and demonstrations. However Tamilnet, the pro-rebel website, denied these claims and claimed that the public were forced {{to take part in the}} celebrations. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Army confiscated the National identity cards of many residents in order to force them to take part. The country officially marked the capture of Kilinochchi on 5 January by hoisting the national flag and observing two minutes of silence to honour the troops, while television and radio stations either blacked out their regular bulletins during this time or played patriotic songs.|$|E

5|$|With the {{continuing}} {{improvement in the}} region's winemaking reputation, enotourism in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right. On-site sales are becoming an increasingly {{important part of the}} business of Oregon winemaking, and other businesses that cater to wine tourists, such as lodging, fine restaurants, art galleries, have been appearing <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> Dundee, many of which have long been rural farming communities. Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace. It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms. There are approximately 1.8 million visits to Oregon wineries each year, 59% by Oregonians and 41% from out of state visitors. Major events drawing significant numbers of tourists to wine country include the International Pinot Noir Celebration which is held the last weekend of July every year since 1987 and the more recent Oregon Chardonnay Celebration.|$|E
