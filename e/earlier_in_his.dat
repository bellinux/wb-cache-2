A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens actually {{came from the same}} species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name Tyrannosaurus had appeared one page <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name Tyrannosaurus was used.|$|E

5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. <b>Earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disadvantages}} of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various {{segments of the}} society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were {{the activities of the}} Silesian dukes Henry I the Bearded, his son Henry II the Pious, who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the Battle of Legnica, and Henry IV Probus. In 1295, Przemysł II of Greater Poland became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Bolesław II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including Gdańsk Pomerania from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Václav II of Bohemia of the Přemyslid dynasty, who married Przemysł's daughter Richeza and became King of Poland in 1300. Václav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> reign; he died in 1305.|$|E
