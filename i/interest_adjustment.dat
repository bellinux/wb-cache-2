50|$|The {{comparable}} uncontrolled price (CUP) {{method is}} a transactional method that determines the arm's-length price using the prices charged in comparable transactions between unrelated parties. In principle, the OECD and most countries that follow the OECD guidelines consider the CUP method {{to be the}} most direct method, provided that any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have no material effect on price or their effects can be estimated and corresponding price adjustments can be made. Adjustments may be appropriate where the controlled and uncontrolled transactions differ only in volume or terms; for example, an <b>interest</b> <b>adjustment</b> could be applied where the only difference is time for payment (e.g., 30 days vs. 60 days). For undifferentiated products such as commodities, price data for arm's-length transactions ("external comparables") between two or more other unrelated parties may be available. For other transactions, {{it may be possible to}} use comparable transactions ("internal comparables") between the controlled party and unrelated parties.|$|E

40|$|House {{and flat}} {{prices have been}} through a {{tremendous}} bust and boom cycle in Denmark. From 1986 to 1993 real prices for houses and flats dropped by one third on average, foreclosures accounted for around 1 / 6 {{of the house and}} flat turnovers in numbers, and in reality the market for owner-occupied houses and flats was in a crisis. Initiated by a strong interest rate drop and by an expansive finance policy, the market turned. From 1993 H 1 to 2004 H 1 real house prices increased 76 % and real flat prices 128 %. Moreover, Denmark has a leading position in the international household debt race and as in many other countries the fear of the consequences of a strong interest rate increase for the housing market is widespread. Therefore, in order to examine the financial stability among owner-occupiers, a sample of approx. 40, 000 owner-occupier families with data at household level has been drawn from the tax statistics for each year from 1987 to 2003. Through the analysis it is shown that the distributions of the owner-occupiers’ capital structure, measured by the net liability/housing wealth ratios, have more or less been the same throughout the 16 years, even during the long-lasting steep house and flat price rise. Moreover, since 1994 the median value of the net liability/income ratio has increased by 71 % for all owner-occupiers and by 54 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. Finally, one last, important aspect of the financial stability of owner-occupiers, namely, their capacity to service their debt has been analysed. The owner-occupiers’ net interest expenditures/ income ratios before tax have been nearly halved from 1987 to 2003. Most of the drop happened during the years of the "housing market failure". From 1994 on the ratios were more slightly reduced and were in 2003 at 8. 8 % (median value) for all owner-occupiers and 12. 2 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. However, if the reductions of the tax rates for deducting interest expenditures are taken into account, the 2003 after-tax-ratios are only about 2 percentage points below the 1987 after-tax ratios. At March 2005, a new challenge facing Danish owner-occupiers is that 50 % of their mortgages carry <b>interest</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Keywords: house prices, housing wealth, real estate wealth, housing debt, mortgage debt, personal wealth, personal finance, loan-to-value, debt-to-income, interest expenditures, interest-to-income, financial stability.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of banks {{with regard to}} the pricing of commercial short term loans over the period from 1975 until 1997. Due to the inclusion of interest rate quotes by banks located in east Germany in 1991 we distinguished between the subperiods from 1975 – 1989 and 1991 – 1997. In the context of the price setting for credit lines we focus on the commonly held belief of asymmetric <b>interest</b> rate <b>adjustments.</b> In order to raise the markup on credit lines banks adjust rates on credit lines slower when refinance rates are decreasing. Estimating error correction models a longterm relation between the rate for interbank money and for credit lines is established.

The finance companies, moreover, are quicker in adjusting their deposit rates than the commercial banks, but are slower in adjusting their loan rates.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} of how {{the labor}} and product markets interact in determining {{the outcome of a}} generalized reduced-form price Phillips-curve. For the labor market we consider a wage Phillips-curve and for the product market a price Phillips-curve. We estimate separately the wage and price Phillips-curves for the U. S., using OLS, nonparametric estimation and Three-Stage Least Squares techniques. The ¯nding is that wages are always more °exible than prices with respect to their respective demand pressure and that price in°ation responds somewhat more to a medium run cost-pressure than does wage in°ation. This implies, as reduced form equation, a real wage dynamic that depends positively on the level of economic activity and thus, if the economy is wage-led, an adverse type of real wage adjustment. Monetary policy is in this case not only facing adverse real rate of <b>interest</b> <b>adjustments</b> (destabilizing Mundell-e®ects), but possibly also destabilizing real wage adjustments (adverse real-wage e®ects), We however also provide some evidence that the U.

40|$|This paper sets up {{a simple}} model for {{interventions}} and interest rate set- ting assuming that the policy maker cares about deviations in inflation from a target level. Under a quadratic cost of <b>interest</b> rate <b>adjustments</b> and interven- tions the policy maker should {{use a combination of}} <b>interest</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> and interventions. According to the model interventions (purchases of foreign currency) will be negatively correlated with interest rate deviations from the steady state level but positively correlated with interest rate deviations per- taining to non-stabilizing motives or a binding zero lower bound. The model also predicts that interventions will be decreasing in inflation expectations and in the real exchange rate but increasing the expected interventions. In- terventions are shown to be positively serially correlated if the policy maker cares about the future. Following the theoretical model closely two sets of regression results are presented using both Two Stage Least Squares and an Ordered Probit model. The empirical analysis uses daily intervention data for Australia, Japan and Sweden. Overall, the predictions of the model is supported in most dimensions indicating that interventions have been used {{in a way that is}} consistent with monetary policy considerations...|$|R

40|$|This paper demonstrates, {{contrary}} {{to what has been}} shown recently, that demand pressure, besides cost-pressure, matters both in the labor market and the market for goods in the determination of wage and price inflation. We consider and estimate both wage and price Phillips-curves for the U. S., using OLS and nonparametric estimation techniques. The finding is that on the whole wages are more flexible than prices with respect to their respective demand pressure terms and that price inflation determination gives (somewhat) more weight to medium term inflation than does wage inflation. This implies, as reduced form equation, a real wage dynamic that depends positively on the real wage, and thus an adverse real wage adjustment, if aggregate demand depends positively on temporary real wage changes (which {{is likely to be the}} case, at least in states of high economic activity). Monetary policy thus is not only facing adverse real rate of <b>interest</b> <b>adjustments</b> (destabilizing Mundell-effects), but also destabilizing real wage adjustments (adverse real-wage effects). Such effects have rarely been discussed and estimated in the literature. In comparing linear and nonlinear estimates we find that for some relationships nonlinearities are important for others not. Although overall the nonlinear estimates tend to confirm our linear estimates nonlinearities in some relationships of the Phillips-curve are important as well.
