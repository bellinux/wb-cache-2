40|$|International {{audience}} We {{demonstrate the}} Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tag- ging systems (also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items {{from a public}} pool of items (e. g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k <b>items</b> having certain <b>tags.</b> Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items {{in response to a}} query should be done in a network-aware manner: <b>items</b> <b>tagged</b> by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than <b>items</b> <b>tagged</b> by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general ap- proach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully- personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} localize passive UHF RFID tags in uncontrolled and unstructured environments {{is limited by}} multi-path propagation. Therefore, {{in order to increase}} the spatial resolution of RF based localization methods we propose to combine them with additional sensing capabilities. In this work we enhance passive UHF RFID tags with LEDs, using the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP). This allows both humans and computer systems (with cameras) to optically locate <b>tagged</b> <b>items</b> with millimeter accuracy. In order to show the effectiveness of this approach, a PR 2 robot is equipped with an EPC Gen 2 RFID reader and camera. Using the RFID reader alone, the PR 2 is able to identify and coarsely locate <b>tagged</b> <b>items</b> in an unstructured environment. Once the robot has navigated to the vicinity of the LED-enhanced passive RFID tags, it uses the optical location method to precisely locate and autonomously grasp <b>tagged</b> <b>items</b> from a table.

40|$|Recommender Systems (RS) aim at {{predicting}} items or {{ratings of}} items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three twodimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations.

Often these systems rely on user activity or descriptions of the content. Social annotation systems, in which users collaboratively assign <b>tags</b> to <b>items,</b> provide another means to capture information about users and items. Each of these data sources provides unique benefits, capturing different relationships. In this paper, we propose leveraging multiple sources of data: ratings data as users report their affinity toward an <b>item,</b> <b>tagging</b> data as users assign annotations to items, and item data collected from an online database. Taken together, these datasets provide {{the opportunity to learn}} rich distributed representations by exploiting recent advances in neural network architectures. We first produce representations that subjectively capture interesting relationships among the data.
