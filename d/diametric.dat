25|$|Stories Toto Told Me (1898), a {{collection}} of six stories, later expanded to thirty-two and republished as In His Own Image (1901), in which ‘Don Friderico’ and his teenage acolytes embark on long walking tours in the Italian countryside, even as far from Rome as the eastern coast of Italy. The youths’ leader, the sixteen-year-old Toto, recounts tales of saints behaving like pagan gods. The stories are richly Catholic and unashamedly superstitious, and the saints who figure in them are hedonistic, revengeful and (though not licentious) entirely comfortable with nudity, <b>diametric</b> to any Protestant ideal of sainthood.|$|E
25|$|Maritime climates tend to {{fall between}} Mediterranean and {{continental}} climates with a moderate climate that is {{tempered by the}} effects of a large body of water nearby. As with Mediterranean climates, the humidity of the particular macroclimate will {{play a significant role in}} determining how much irrigation is needed. In most cases irrigation, if it is used at all, will only be supplemental in years where drought may be an issue. Many maritime regions, such as Rias Baixas in Galicia, Bordeaux and the Willamette Valley in Oregon, suffer from the <b>diametric</b> problem of having too much rain during the growing season.|$|E
25|$|Reima Pietilä {{had also}} {{been active in the}} {{activities}} of the Museum of Finnish Architecture as well as publishing theoretical articles in Le Carré Bleu and Arkkitehti. Pietilä even attended a meeting of the Team X group of architects, held in 1972 at Cornell University in the USA, who were very much concerned with questions of structuralism in architecture, that is emphasising the elements of culture, somewhat in reaction to the universalising tendencies of modernism, especially as originally promoted by Team X's instigators, the older generation of CIAM. Pietilä took a <b>diametric</b> viewpoint to that of the rationalist school, and though the works (designed in partnership with his wife Raili Pietilä) had much of the organic idiosyncrasies of Aalto, they were far more abstract and nebulous. In arguing that nature is the apotheosis of plasticity, he demanded a morphological analysis of architectural products, considering Euclidean geometry as an inadequate instrument of analysis. His first major work, the Finnish Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Expo did in fact take a modular approach akin to the theories of Blomstedt; however, the wooden rectangular box-like units as a whole gave a foretaste of Pietilä's later surfaces based entirely on free form; the most notable of these organic works being Kaleva Church, Tampere (1959–66), Dipoli student assembly building, Espoo (1961–66), Metso Library, Tampere (1978–86) and culminating in his final work, the Official Residence of the President of Finland, Mäntyniemi, Helsinki (1983–93). All these buildings had been the result of open architectural competitions.|$|E

Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] grade, and said that while it [...] "started strong" [...] the energy level was [...] "lacking", a word that Futterman {{used to describe the}} performance as a whole, to which she added [...] "emotionless and rushed". A <b>diametric</b> view of the song was evident in the [...] "A−" [...] grades given by both Slezak and Strecker, and the latter also complimented the [...] "different" [...] arrangement while both were enthusiastic about the entire set of three songs: Slezak said New Directions [...] "completely killed it", and Strecker said this song [...] "kicked off what was a truly an all-time great performance".|$|E
500|$|The 1990s saw {{the onset}} of <b>diametric</b> changes in {{official}} Mexican government policies towards indigenous and linguistic rights. Developments of accords in the international rights arena combined with domestic pressures (such as social and political agitation by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and indigenous social movements) led to legislative reforms {{and the creation of}} decentralized government agencies like National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI) and Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI) with responsibilities for the promotion and protection of indigenous communities and languages. In particular, the federal Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas [...] recognizes all the country's indigenous languages, including Nahuatl, as [...] "national languages" [...] and gives indigenous people the right to use them in all spheres of public and private life. In Article 11, it grants access to compulsory, bilingual and intercultural education. Nonetheless, progress towards institutionalizing Nahuatl and securing linguistic rights for its speakers has been slow.|$|E

2500|$|During the screenwriting process, a {{stronger}} emphasis {{was placed on}} special effects, rather than satire and story. Overall, the tone of the film is in <b>diametric</b> opposition to the comics. Whereas Katz declared, [...] "It's a film about a duck from outer space... It's not supposed to be an existential experience... We're supposed to have fun with this concept, but for some reason reviewers weren't able to get over that problem." [...] Gerber declared that the comic-book series was an existental joke, stating, [...] "'This is no joke!' There it is. The cosmic giggle. The funniest gag in the universe. That life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. Anyone who doesn't believe this probably cannot enjoy reading Howard the Duck." [...] However, after shooting was finished, Gerber stated that he felt the film was faithful to both the spirit of the comic book and the characters of Howard and Beverly.|$|E

Weatherly divulged, [...] "With the appearance of EJ, suddenly there's a renewed spirit that Tony has always had in him – it's what made him to go Africa and rescue Ziva with McGee. [...] he acts like a goofball because that's what people expect, but in this episode he comes away from that place. We'll see what the audience thinks, but for me, he feels potential and possibility {{in a way that}} he hasn't for years. EJ is a mirror, so he sees that hope for himself again." [...] He added, [...] "She's the <b>diametric</b> opposite of Ziva – physically, and in her demeanor, her way of being. She has her eccentricities as well, which makes her adorable to Tony and highly irritating to Ziva." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Christian missionaries {{who arrived}} through the ports of eastern states of India such as Calcutta in the 18th- and 19th-centuries, Jagannath was the [...] "core of idolatry" [...] {{and the target}} of [...] "an all-out attack". Jagannath, called Juggernaut by the Christian missionary Claudius Buchanan, was through Buchanan's letters the initial {{introduction}} in America of Hinduism, which he termed as [...] "Hindoo". According to Michael J. Altman, a professor of Religious Studies, Buchanan presented Hinduism to the American audience, through Juggernaut, as a [...] "bloody, violent, superstitious and backward religious system" [...] {{that needs to be}} eliminated and substituted with the Christian gospel. He described Juggernaut with Biblical terminology for his audience, called him the Moloch, and his shrine as Golgatha – the place where Jesus Christ was crucified, but with the difference that the [...] "Juggernaut tradition" [...] was of endless meaningless bloodshed, fabricating allegations that children were sacrificed in the [...] "valley of idolatrous blood shed to false gods". In his letters, states Altman, Buchanan [...] "constructed an image of Juggernaut as the <b>diametric</b> opposite of Christianity".|$|E

But it has another aspect, or rather another pole, for the opposition is <b>diametric.</b> As the simplest, so also {{it is the most}} complex of human art. I told you in my fifth Lecture, showing you the spotty picture of Velasquez, that an essential Greek character is a liking for things that are dappled. And you cannot but have noticed how often and how prevalently the idea which gave its name to the Porch of Polygnotus, [...] "[Greek: stoa poikilê]," [...] occurs to the Greeks as connected with the finest art. Thus, when the luxurious city is opposed to the simple and healthful one, in the second book of Plato's Polity, you find that, next to perfumes, pretty ladies, and dice, you must have in it [...] "[Greek: poikilia]," [...] which observe, both in that place and again in the third book, is the separate art of joiners' work, or inlaying; but the idea of exquisitely divided variegation or division, both in sight and sound--the [...] "ravishing division to the lute," [...] as in Pindar's [...] "[Greek: poikiloi hymnoi]"--runs through the compass of all Greek art-description; and if, instead of studying that art among marbles you were to look at it only on vases of a fine time, (look back, for instance, to Plate IV. here), your impression of it would be, instead of breadth and simplicity, one of universal spottiness and chequeredness, [...] "[Greek: en angeôn Herkesin pampoikilois];" [...] and of the artist's delighting in nothing so much as in crossed or starred or spotted things; which, in right places, he and his public both do unlimitedly. Indeed they hold it complimentary even to a trout, to call him a [...] "spotty." [...] Do you recollect the trout in the tributaries of the Ladon, which Pausanias says were spotted, so that they were like thrushes and which, the Arcadians told him, could speak? In this last [Greek: poikilia], however, they disappointed him. [...] "I, indeed, saw some of them caught," [...] he says, [...] "but I did not hear any of them speak, though I waited beside the river till sunset." ...|$|E
