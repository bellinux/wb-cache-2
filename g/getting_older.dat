Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps {{out of fear}} that she was <b>getting</b> <b>older</b> with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.|$|E

In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.|$|E

500|$|Hordern and Jonathan Miller reprised their {{collaboration}} in 1982 {{with a final}} performance of King Lear, again televised by the BBC.

The author Joseph Pearce, writing in 2008, claimed that Hordern played the king [...] "straight up with no gloss" [...] and made a [...] "reliable and workmanlike Lear" [...] who is [...] "forceful when he should be forceful, compassionate when he should be compassionate, [...] sorrowful when he should be sorrowful". Despite the praise, Pearce thought that Hordern's performance in Act 3 [...] "lack the required fierceness and miss the mythic quality when compared to some of the bigger names".|$|E

With his {{children}} <b>getting</b> <b>older</b> and the couple's toy company struggling to stay afloat, Jarrell became {{assistant professor at}} the University of Georgia. His position at the university assured him studio space. In 1979 he had two solo shows and participated in three AFRICOBRA exhibitions. His work continued to be socially and politically aware with paintings like Festival #1 (1978) showing brilliant Senufo figures, a work supporting South Africans at war. African imagery became more apparent in his paintings with zigzag patterns and lizards appearing, representing [...] "that Africans, as the first people, have the right to speak on their own behalf," [...] as seen in Midnight Poet at 125th Street & Lenox (1979). In 1979 Jarrell received grant money to create a 52 x 31 foot mural at the East Athens Community Center. A team of art students helped Jarrell and Jae to complete the work, titled Ascension, which remains in Athens today.|$|E

500|$|Maia Ahmad, at {{the time}} wife of the {{musician}} Ahmad Dhani, had been a background singer for her husband's band Dewa 19 since 1993. She had been musically inclined since childhood and had formed a band while a teenager. She intended to be like her husband and enter the music industry as a headline performer. In a later interview, she explained her motivations: [...] "I wasn't following {{on the success of}} Krisdayanti dan Anang, a husband and wife who had made an album together. I just started when I did. Dhani only gave me the time then, as our children were <b>getting</b> <b>older</b> and I could focus on my music." [...] With Dhani's guidance, in 1999 Maia decided to form a duo consisting of a singer and a musician, with the name Ratu. The concept was based on that of international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden. Maia set herself as a keyboardist, then began to look for a vocalist.|$|E

Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're <b>getting</b> <b>older</b> and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record".

500|$|Musically, A Thousand Leaves was {{considered}} more expansive and relaxed than previous Sonic Youth albums, with less feedback and more guitar playing and improvisation. According to David Browne, the record explored post-rock sounds that were [...] "subtler" [...] and [...] "quirkier" [...] than most mainstream rock at the time. The {{title of the}} album was inspired by Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. According to Moore, [...] "The same way he improvises with images and words, we improvise with sounds and notes". He also attributed {{the style of the}} album {{to the fact that the}} band was <b>getting</b> <b>older,</b> commenting, [...] "You also become much involved with your thoughts about life experience in general. Having children is incredible in that way." [...] The song [...] "Snare, Girl" [...] explored these topics. The longest song on the album, [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)", referenced American poet Allen Ginsberg and contains an instrumental interlude that was described as [...] "a subtle, drawn-out passage of Morse code guitar lines and lazy afternoon with wah-wah pedal licks—bliss in slow motion." ...|$|E

The two agree that while they are both unhappy, they do not feel the same about each other any more. Two old farmers, who previously watched Randy perform, overhear the argument and break into the Marshes' home to steal Randy's underwear, believing that they are acting humanely on its behalf.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Leaves is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1995 album Washing Machine, which was released {{shortly after the}} band concluded their stint headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. With the money they had made at the festival, the band decided to build a recording studio, called Echo Canyon, on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan. The span of nearly three years between Washing Machine and A Thousand Leaves also represented the longest gap between studio albums in Sonic Youth's career at the time. Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore explained that the band needed a break, noting {{that they had been}} touring non-stop for 16 years. He said, [...] "We're having children, we're <b>getting</b> <b>older,</b> let's just cool out a little bit and build this workshop, and go that way, work that route." [...] In their new studio, the band began writing new songs from extended improvisations in rehearsal.

These include , [...] and [...]|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents <b>getting</b> <b>older</b> and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E
