More than 800 fans' ashes have been buried at Goodison Park and since 2004 the club have had to reject further {{requests}} because there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> any more. Tommy Lawton wanted his ashes to be scattered at Goodison but his son chose to donate them to the national football museum because of Goodison's uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

25|$|Though {{women are}} {{considered}} to be members of the Katipunan, information regarding the women's section were scarce and sometimes conflicting. Teodoro Agoncillo, for example, disregarded Marina Dizon and concluded that Josefa Rizal was the only president of the said section. Gregorio Zaide, on the other hand, mentioned Dizon's presidency in his 1939 publication History of the Katipunan but changed his mind when he adopted Dr. Pío Valenzuela's notion that women-members did not elect officers, hence there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> president.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|He {{called them}} earlier or later. The three ages became six periods. The British {{seized on the}} concept immediately. Worsaae's earlier and later became Lubbock's palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but {{alternatively}} English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell's 1883 edition of Principles of Geology, with older and younger as synonyms. As there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which {{would have resulted in}} such terms as early early stone age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.|$|E

Petőfi felt that the country would not be saved through moderation, but {{through the use of}} the most extreme means available. He detested even the thought of cowardice… Petőfi's vision was correct. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> prudence in revolutions whose fate and eventual success is always decided by boldness and raw courage… this is why Petőfi condemned his compatriots for the sin of opportunism and hesitation when faced with the great problems of their age… Petőfi's works must be regarded as the law of the Hungarian soul… and of the… love of the country".|$|E

25|$|Other {{than the}} current {{westbound}} off ramp, existing ramps linking the bridge traffic to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island are inadequate to handle traffic for future expected residential development. In particular, the eastbound off ramp has always been extremely hazardous, while added westbound on ramp traffic would interfere with bridge traffic flow. Between the tunnel's western portal and the existing western suspension span, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> modern ramp configurations. The developments are expected to add some three thousand residents to the island, as well as business and office space. To support this traffic, a system of new ramps (currently only partially completed) will be built {{on the eastern side}} of the islands to link to the YBITS, where there will be adequate room for proper traffic merges and departures. The east-side ramps are expected to cost about $95,670,000 while they began construction on late-2013 for a June 2016 opening. New westbound on- and off-ramps opened on October 22, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
500|$|Stanley's {{achievements}} in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised {{the structure of}} the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that is apt to take in innocent persons like you and me... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> funks in the modern world."

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has also}} been {{suggested}} that substantive natural justice would merely be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper role as conferred by the Constitution. In addition, one scholar has asserted that {{there is no doubt that}} a judicial inquiry covers both substantive and procedural aspects. It is said that Article 9(1) connotes a judicial inquiry into the [...] "fairness" [...] of the law tested against certain principles regarded as fundamental to the legal system. Distinguishing between substantive and procedural fairness is a meaningless exercise, as it merely clouds the process of judicial inquiry. Judicial review is judicial review under whatever name, and as far as Article 9(1) is concerned, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> making this distinction.|$|E

[...] Lake deemed the book [...] "faultlessly relevant, but ultimately cloying." [...] Another Publishers Weekly review was also less positive, calling the book [...] "beautifully staged" [...] but [...] "haphazardly plotted", and noting: [...] "Cleave has a sharp cinematic eye, but {{the plot is}} undermined by weak motivations and coincidences." [...] Teeman of The Times felt that the book was overwritten, and wished [...] "twistedly" [...] {{that it had a}} less positive conclusion, commenting: [...] "With every motive and action explicitly drawn, fleshed out and explained, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> mystery, ambiguity or even tension." ...|$|E

Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (à la fighting between Peter and The Giant Chicken) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers {{when they hit the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, then end up in Kang and Kodos' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing [...] "I will not think about Bart anymore" [...] several times on a chalkboard.|$|E
