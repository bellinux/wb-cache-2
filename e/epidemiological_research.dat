25|$|Although many {{epidemiological}} {{risk factors}} have been identified, the cause of any individual breast cancer is most often unknowable. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>research</b> informs the patterns of breast cancer incidence across certain populations, {{but not in a}} given individual. Approximately 5% of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes, and well-established risk factors accounts for approximately 30% of cases.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his <b>epidemiological</b> <b>research,</b> Gordon also researched and published extensively {{on the use of}} various anthelmintics in sheep. He was responsible for the discovery in the late 1930s of phenothiazine, a safe and effective anthelmintic. His research showed that this compound could effectively control intestinal parasites in sheep and cattle. This discovery, and local production of the required chemicals, resulted in a massive cut in the economic losses suffered by farmers due to intestinal parasitism. Phenothiazine was the mainstay of internal parasite control in sheep in Australia until the 1960s, when broad-spectrum anthelmintics became available.|$|E
500|$|Research {{and studies}} on tobacco's {{effects on the}} population's health were more {{advanced}} in Germany {{than in any other}} nation by the time the Nazis came to power. The link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proven in Nazi Germany, contrary to the popular belief that American and British scientists first discovered it in the 1950s. The term [...] "passive smoking" [...] ("Passivrauchen") was coined in Nazi Germany. Research projects funded by the Nazis revealed many disastrous effects of smoking on health. Nazi Germany supported <b>epidemiological</b> <b>research</b> on the harmful effects of tobacco use. Hitler personally gave financial support to the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren (Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research) at the University of Jena, headed by Karl Astel.

A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link with these incidences and to the accident. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population, such as a non-significant excess leukemia among males being observed.

40|$|A {{total of}} 492 cattle sera was {{screened}} by IgG-ELISA against Neospora caninum (Nc- 1 strain and a Korean isolate, KBA- 2) and Toxoplasma gondii. Out of 492, 113 sera (23. 0 %) reacted positively to either Nc- 1 or KBA- 2 strains of N. caninum. Among the 113 positive sera, 92 sera (81. 4 %) reacted with antigens of both strains, but 6 sera (5. 3 %) with Nc- 1 and 15 sera (13. 3 %) with KBA- 2 strain only. And with T. gondii antigen, 6 sera (1. 2 %) were positive but all reacted with N. caninum antigen also.

40|$|International audienceWe {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} venous compression ultrasonography (CUS) {{for the detection of}} asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in 122 consecutive patients, {{with a mean age of}} 69 years, who were hospitalised in an internal medicine unit.

Twelve out of 17 patients with a positive CUS underwent phlebography, as the others withdrew their consent, whereas the remaining 105 patients with a negative serial CUS testing were clinically followed-up at 3 months. We found that CUS had a sensitivity and a specificity of respectively 1 (95 % CI, 0. 73 to 1) and 1 (95 % CI, 0. 96 to 1) for the detection of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis. Kappa-coefficients for intra-observer and inter-observer agreements were respectively 0. 88 and 0. 56.
