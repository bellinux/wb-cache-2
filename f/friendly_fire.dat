5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from <b>friendly</b> <b>fire.</b> British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was brought forward by {{one day to}} 20 September. The change of schedule caused the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division to commit to battle as it arrived in eastern Slavonia with no reconnaissance or preparation. The resulting traffic jam on the ŠidTovarnikStari Jankovci road prevented bridging units from reaching the Bosut River. That in turn prevented the 1st Guards Division from crossing the river and confined it to the area between the Bosut and the Danube, east of Vinkovci. Besides the bridging units, the division did not receive the 80th Motorised Brigadewhich appears to have disintegrated before reaching the Croatian frontierand the 2nd Guards Mechanised Brigadea victim of <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> bombardment in the area between Tovarnik and Ilača adjacent to the border. Several units of the Novi Sad Corps also disintegrated when morale declined {{after a number of}} <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incidents.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense {{announced}} that it would pay US$100,000 (ex gratia) in compensation to the families of each of the non-U.S. personnel killed in the incident. At this time, the U.S. government, citing the Feres precedent, did not offer compensation {{to the families of the}} U.S. victims. This was the first time that the U.S. had offered compensation to the victims of a <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incident.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, <b>friendly</b> <b>fire,</b> or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Some of No. 111 Squadron dived {{onto the}} Dorniers, but one Hurricane was shot down, {{either by the}} Dorniers or British ground fire. Pilot Flight Lieutenant Stanley Connors was killed. The rest pulled up and away to avoid <b>friendly</b> <b>fire.</b> They flew to the {{northern}} edge of the airfield to catch the raiders as they emerged. Two Hurricanes from No. 615 were taking off under the attack.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian expert Anton Lavrov, on 8 August, Russian and South Ossetian troops {{deployed}} in South Ossetia were unaware that Russian aviation {{was involved in}} the war. Russian troops and South Ossetians often assessed Russian aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place. On 8 August, the air force performed 63 flights in support of Russian ground troops. A total of six Russian aircraft were lost during the war: one Su-25SM, two Su-25BMs, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3; <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> was the cause of the downing of three planes. Lavrov denies that the downed Tu-22M was used for reconnaissance.|$|E

5|$|During the conflict, several {{claims of}} Iraqi air-to-air successes were made, {{including}} an Iraqi pilot, Khudai Hijab, who allegedly fired a Vympel R-27R missile from his MIG-29 and damaged a B-52G {{on the opening}} night of the Gulf War. However, the U.S. Air Force disputes this claim, stating the bomber was actually hit by <b>friendly</b> <b>fire,</b> an AGM-88 High-speed, Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) that homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52's tail gun; the jet was subsequently renamed In HARM's Way. Shortly following this incident, General George Lee Butler announced that the gunner position on B-52 crews would be eliminated, and the gun turrets permanently deactivated, commencing on 1 October 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not {{involved}} in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E

5|$|On {{operations}} {{their performance}} was generally below par, but the Frenchmen {{were involved in}} some successful actions during February and early March 1978. Their oppressive treatment of the black villagers they encountered made them very unpopular in the operational area. The Rhodesians quickly deemed the experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for the company during {{the latter part of}} its second tour, including two <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incidents and several fatalities, it was disbanded in May 1978. Forces led by one of its members, Bob Denard, later that month executed a coup d'état in the Comoros with French, Rhodesian and South African governmental support.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part {{of the reason for}} deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incidents. The exiled Norwegian military authorities had originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be able}} to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of power to}} the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried {{to set up a}} separate alliance (the Sonderbund). The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through <b>friendly</b> <b>fire.</b> Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the {{operation}} was a disaster. Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down, or were damaged and turned back, due to both <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> and enemy action. The evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area, and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge. Resisting attacks {{from the north and}} south, they held out against increasing odds until nightfall.|$|E
5|$|At 08:13, {{the first}} {{formations}} took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before {{the target was}} reached, some 14 D-9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> again on the return flight.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of <b>friendly</b> <b>fire.</b> In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|In 1755 {{he participated}} as a {{volunteer}} aide in the ill-fated expedition of General Edward Braddock, where he distinguished himself in the retreat following the climactic Battle of Monongahela. He served from 1755 until 1758 as colonel and commander of the Virginia Regiment, directing the provincial defenses against French and Indian raids and building the regiment {{into one of the}} best-trained provincial militias of the time. He led the regiment as part of the 1758 expedition of General John Forbes that successfully drove the French from Fort Duquesne, during which he and some of his companies were involved in a <b>friendly</b> <b>fire</b> incident. Unable to get a commission in the British Army, Washington then resigned from the provincial militia, married, and took up the life of a Virginia plantation owner.|$|E
