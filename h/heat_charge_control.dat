40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we address the {{problems}} of hysteresis and vibrations that limit the accuracy of piezoelectric positioners. It is widely known {{that the use of}} <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> significantly reduces hysteresis, thus enabling high-accuracy positioning during low speed operations. However, <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> is unable to reduce vibrations that limit the positioning bandwidth. Our main contribution is to overcome this bandwidth limitation by augmenting <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> with inverse feedforward to compensate for vibrations, resulting in a high-bandwidth, highaccuracy positioning system. We apply this integrated method to a piezoelectric tube actuator and experimental results are presented to illustrate the positioning improvements with the proposed integrated approach...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) technology provide a cost-effective solution to charge wireless devices remotely without disruption to the use. In this paper, we propose an efficient wireless <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method for exploiting the frequency diversity in multiuser broadband wireless networks, to reduce energy outage and keep the system operating in an efficient and sustainable state. In particular, we first analyze the impact of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method to the operating lifetime of a WPT-enabled broadband system. Based on the analysis, we then propose a multi-criteria <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> policy that optimizes the transmit power allocation over frequency by jointly considering the channel state information (CSI) and the battery state information (BSI) of wireless devices. For practical implementation, the proposed scheme is realized by a novel limited CSI estimation mechanism embedded with partial BSI, which significantly reduces the energy cost of CSI and BSI feedback. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method could significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power constraint. Reciprocally, it also consumes lower transmit power to achieve near-perpetual network operation than other single-criterion based <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> methods.
