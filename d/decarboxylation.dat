5|$|Biosynthetically, the {{biochemical}} {{transformation from}} tryptophan to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions: <b>decarboxylation,</b> methylation at the N9 position, 4-hydroxylation, and O-phosphorylation. Isotopic labeling experiments suggest that tryptophan <b>decarboxylation</b> is the initial biosynthetic step and that O-phosphorylation {{is the final}} step.)

5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the <b>decarboxylation</b> of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this <b>decarboxylation</b> reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and <b>decarboxylation</b> for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the <b>decarboxylation</b> step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E

5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the <b>decarboxylation</b> (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} element for life and is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of iodine atoms). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by <b>decarboxylation</b> and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

Its mechanism has recently been proposed to proceed through substrate protonation by an arginine residue. A 2008 report demonstrated that the uncatalyzed rate for UroD's reaction is 10−19 s−1, so at pH 10 the rate acceleration of UroD relative to the uncatalyzed rate, i.e. catalytic proficiency, is the largest for any enzyme known, 6 x 1024 M−1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Those {{features}} of micellar organization and structure most {{pertinent to the}} understanding of micellar catalysis of organic reactions are briefly reviewed. Of crucial importance are the properties of the micelle—water interface: marked hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity as man— ifested in binding of both organic molecules and ions to the micellar surface; a surface dielectric constant near 35; the high concentration of charged groups at the micellar surface; a water activity near unity; and the presence of functional groups. Those factors contributing to micellar catalysis are reviewed. For nonfunctional micelles, effects are either the consequence {{of the nature of the}} reaction medium (activity coefficient effects), the concentration of reactants (entropy effects) or both. Per— tinent examples are cited including <b>decarboxylations,</b> phosphate ester hy— drolyses, fading of dyes, and addition of cyanide ion to pyridinium ions.

The heterologously expressed enzymes accepted acetyl-, n-butyryl-, isovale-ryl-, n-hexanoyl-, benzoyl-, cinnamoyl-, and p-couma-royl-CoA as starter molecules and together with the co-substrate malonyl-CoA, formed multiple products.

2500|$|The lolines are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} pyrrolizidine alkaloids produced by many plants, notably the necine ring containing a tertiary amine. This {{led to the}} early hypothesis that the biosynthesis of the lolines {{is similar to that}} of the plant pyrrolizidines, which are synthesized from polyamines. However, feeding studies with carbon isotope–labeled amino acids or related molecules in pure cultures of the loline-producing fungus N. uncinatum recently demonstrated that the loline alkaloid pathway is fundamentally different from that of the plant pyrrolizidines. The basic loline chemical structure is assembled in several biosynthetic steps from the amino acid precursors, L-proline and [...] L-homoserine. In the proposed first step in loline biosynthesis, these two amino acids are coupled in a condensation reaction linking the γ-carbon in homoserine to the secondary amine in proline in a PLP–type enzyme–catalyzed reaction to form the loline intermediate, N-(3-amino-3-carboxy)propylproline (NACPP). Further steps in loline biosynthesis are thought to proceed with sequential PLP-enzyme-catalyzed and oxidative <b>decarboxylations</b> of the carboxy groups in the homoserine and proline moieties, respectively, cyclization to form the core loline ring structure, and oxidation of the C-2 and C-7 carbons to give the oxygen bridge spanning the two pyrrolizidine rings.|$|R
40|$|Radical SAM’ enzymes {{generate}} catalytic radicals {{by combining}} a 4 Fe– 4 S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in close proximity. We present the first crystal {{structure of a}} Radical SAM enzyme, that of HemN, the Escherichia coli oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, at 2. 07  Å resolution. HemN catalyzes the essential conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX during heme biosynthesis. HemN binds a 4 Fe– 4 S cluster through three cysteine residues conserved in all Radical SAM enzymes. A juxtaposed SAM coordinates the fourth Fe ion through its amide nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen. The SAM sulfonium sulfur is near both the Fe (3. 5  Å) and a neighboring sulfur of the cluster (3. 6  Å), allowing single electron transfer from the 4 Fe– 4 S cluster to the SAM sulfonium. SAM is cleaved yielding a highly oxidizing 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl radical. HemN, strikingly, binds a second SAM immediately adjacent to the first. It may thus successively catalyze two propionate <b>decarboxylations.</b> The structure of HemN reveals the cofactor geometry required for Radical SAM catalysis and {{sets the stage for}} the development of inhibitors with antibacterial function due to the uniquely bacterial occurrence of the enzyme...|$|R

Resolution of the polypeptide subunits on two-dimensional gels allowed quantitative analysis of their cellular levels and patterns of synthesis in growing cells. Cells growing in glucose-salts medium were found to contain roughly 85 to 136 pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes and 73 2 -oxoglutarate complexes. Lipoamide dehydrogenase, the subunit shared by the two complexes, {{was found to be}} in significant excess of its stoichiometric demand in the two enzyme complexes under most growth conditions. The subunits unique to each of the complexes were coordinately regulated over a wide variety of growth conditions and a broad range of expression.

40|$|An {{alternative}} route for haem b biosynthesis is operative in sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfovibrio genus and in methanogenic Archaea. This pathway diverges from the canonical {{one at the}} level of uroporphyrinogen III and progresses via a distinct branch, where sirohaem acts as an intermediate precursor being converted into haem b by a set of novel enzymes, named the alternative haem biosynthetic proteins (Ahb). In this work, we report the biochemical characterisation of the Desulfovibrio vulgaris AhbD enzyme that catalyses the last step of the pathway. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that AhbD promotes the cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and converts iron-coproporphyrin III via two oxidative <b>decarboxylations</b> to yield haem b, methionine and the 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that AhbD contains two [4 Fe– 4 S] 2 +/ 1 + centres and that binding of the substrates S-adenosylmethionine and iron-coproporphyrin III induces conformational modifications in both centres. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that D. vulgaris AhbD belongs to the radical SAM protein superfamily, with a GGE-like motif and two cysteine-rich sequences typical for ligation of SAM molecules and iron-sulfur clusters, respectively.
