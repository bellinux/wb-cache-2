500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, {{to see if the}} eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{porthole}} as the bow swung past {{the line of}} sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our starboard quarter in the formation.

5000|$|I got two dogs, Niggy, {{the little}} black one, and Peewee, a brown one, that's bigger. Me and my wife were sitting here in the living room. We heard the dogs get awful restless. My front light was on and Larry Moore ... had his back light on. I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw this thing. It had me plumb spellbound. It was bout 20 inches high. It had a long tail, about 14 inches. The color of it was dark. It had a face exactly like a cat. Only I ain't ever seen a cat that big. It was walking around stealthy, sneaky, moving about {{trying to get to}} Niggy and Peewee. I jumped for my shotgun and loaded it and went out to shoot it, but it moved into the {{darkness}} right away and I couldn't find him again. [...] A group of hunters from Wilmington including S. W. Garret, G. V. Garret, and Joe Gore spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80 lb. to 90 lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.|$|E

5000|$|From the Memoirs of George Albert DeLong, {{helmsman}} of Helena when Juneau was sunk.My {{assignment was}} on the bridge in the pilot house as helmsman. While steering the ship I {{had the opportunity to}} glance out the port holes and I saw the condition of the San Francisco and the Juneau. I remember commenting to one {{of the men in the}} pilot house that the San Francisco looked so beat up that she would be lucky to make it back to Espiritu Santo, but that the Juneau, while she was down by the bow, still looked seaworthy enough to make it back.Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom left the bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong."

I <b>glanced</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> port hole and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.By this time the Helena was making good time through the water again and picking up momentum heading straight for the cloud. The wheel was still turned hard left and I had no idea where either the Juneau or the San Francisco were. Total silence reigned in the pilot house and on the wings of the bridge.Now it was my turn to shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone was out on the wing of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.Finally, one of the sailors stuck his head in the door and quietly said, [...] "DeLong, she ain't no more." [...] I didn't fully understand what he meant but I decided to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time enough to keep the rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the rudder hit the stop, but it was light enough so there was no jamming.The people that had gone outside now filled me in with what had happened. The Juneau didn't sink; she was blown up. Everyone had seen pieces of her flying through the sky. The largest piece was reported as one of her five-inch gun mounts flying over the Helena.Captain Hoover wisely decided to save all the ships he could and decided not to stop to look for survivors - no one thought there would be any. Even if there were, the subs might still be around and more ships and men could be lost.|$|E

Even if there were, the subs might still be around and more ships and men could be lost.As a footnote to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated across from each other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right in the middle of my story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.From that point on he took over the story. He told us that in the early part of his career he had taken special training on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he felt a little safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.George A. DeLong ...|$|E
