50|$|Gravity feed is the {{simplest}} and cheapest form of hopper available. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> consist of a large container and a feed tube molded into the bottom. Paintballs roll down the sloped sides, through the tube and into the marker. These hoppers have a maximum rate of 11.6 balls per second. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> are very cheap, since they are made of only a shell and a lid, but can become jammed easily as paintballs accumulate above the tube. Rocking the marker (and hopper) occasionally can prevent the paintballs from jamming in the hopper.|$|E

40|$|Corn is {{the primary}} feed grain in the U. S., and it {{accounts}} for more than 90 percent of total feed grain production and use. Besides this, corn {{is the primary}} input for the U. S. ethanol industry. This results in tremendous infrastructure for handling and storage of corn and byproducts throughout the year. The flow properties of ground corn, which is a principal ingredient of animal feed, are very complex in nature. Many physical and chemical properties viz. angle of repose, bulk density, moisture of the product, protein content in the surface layer, etc. affects the flow properties of corn and its products. Flow through a hopper is a typical example of complex flow. Bridging or caking of feed material in <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> are common problems, and many times blocks the flow completely leaving animals without feed. Daily changes in temperature and relative humidity affect the equilibrium moisture content of feed. Size of corn particles affect angle of repose, bulk density and cohesive forces between particles, and thus flow characteristics of the feed. In this study, flow characteristics of ground corn were examined as functions of particle size and moisture content. Feed utilization was historically maximum (i. e. minimum ratio of feed consumption to weight gain), when mean particle size diameter is about 822 microns for roller milled corn flour. In recent times, livestock producers have found that feed efficiency can increase as particle size decreases. Furthermore, excess moisture makes flour sticky and hampers free sliding of particles over each other during flow. Keeping this in view, different combinations of particle sizes and product moisture content were studied with the objectives of understanding and enhancing corn flour flowability...|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} hand-reared ring-necked {{pheasants}} Phasianus colchicus in summer {{is a common}} practice in Britain {{to increase the number}} of birds available to hunters in winter. The breeding success of the birds which survive the shooting season is poor. Traditionally, birds are provided with supplementary wheat grain from release until the end of the shooting season (1 February) to maintain body condition and to help hold birds in areas for hunting. During 1997 - 2000 we assessed the effect of continuing supplementary feeding into spring on pheasant density and breeding success on seven private shooting estates. On each estate we randomly selected two distinct 1 -km 2 plots and provided wheat grain via <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> for birds in breeding territories in one of the plots on each estate while the other plot acted as an untreated control. Food was provided from mid-February to mid-May. We crossed-over the treatment and control plot on each estate each year. We conducted pre- and post-breeding pheasant counts in the plots during April and September. During April, densities were higher in treatment plots than in control plots for territorial males: (mean ± SE) treatment = 22. 6 ± 1. 5 birds/km 2, control = 14. 8 ± 1. 2 birds/km 2, (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and for females: treatment = 40. 6 ± 5. 8 birds/km 2, control = 24. 1 ± 3. 8 birds/km 2 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). In September we found no statistical effect of treatment on densities of adult birds or on brood size. However, more young were observed on treatment plots: 10. 8 ± 1. 5 birds/km 2, than in control plots: 5. 6 ± 1. 0 birds/km 2, (P = 0. 02).

The NAHMS Layers ' 99 Study was designed to provide information about the nation's layer population for education and research purposes. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collaborated with VS to select a statistically-valid sample from 15 states for Layers ' 99. The 15 -state target population accounted for over three-quarters of the table egg layers in the U. S. as of December 1, 1998. The study was limited to companies with 30, 000 or more layer. About two-thirds (68. 1 percent) of farm sites did not allow visitors that did not have a business reason for visiting the operation in the layer houses. The percentage of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors in the layer houses did not differ by size of farm site. However, visitors {{were more likely to be}} required to sign in on farm sites of 100, 000 or more layers than on farm sites with fewer layers. About two-thirds (62. 9 percent) of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors required the visitors, vehicles not to have been on any other poultry farm that day. A total of 22. 9 percent of farm sites did not allow business visitors, such as a salesperson or feed service personnel, in the layer houses. The average usual down time between flocks ranged from 10. 5 days for farm sites in the Central region to 20. 4 days in the Great Lakes region. About one-third (35. 1 percent) of farm sites usually had a down time of 18 days or longer, while 8. 6 percent of farm sites usually had down time of less than 4 days. The median down time was 14 days. Over 98 percent of farm sites emptied feeders and 91. 3 percent emptied <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> between flocks. About 80 percent each flushed water lines and dry cleaned cages, walls, and ceilings, while 71. 8 percent cleaned fans and ventilation systems between each flock.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>hopper.</b> Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|R
