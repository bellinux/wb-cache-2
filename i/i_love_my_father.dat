5000|$|On September 13, 2012, Wiley {{formally}} {{launched a}} recall campaign against Roque, {{during which he}} would run to replace Roque as Mayor. Wiley has invested $50,000 {{of his own money}} into his campaign. Wiley may face political opponents in his run for Mayor, in part {{due to the fact that}} his father, James Wiley, who served as the head of North Bergen’s Department of Public Works from 1995 until his retirement on August 31, 2012, pleaded guilty on September 11, 2012 in County Superior Court to second-degree conspiracy to commit official misconduct after having used North Bergen town employees to work at his house and perform campaign duties and personal chores for him.When asked after the event whether Count Wiley thought his father’s actions would affect his chances as mayor, Wiley answered, [...] "No, it won’t. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to death. I dont condone what my father did. He is an individual as everyone else, but I have no control over the decisions he made. It has no bearing on anything I would do in West New York and my records prove that. Whatever decisions I have made have been for the people and not for myself. He did something wrong and hes paying the price for it." [...] Tempers flared between the two politicians at an October 10 Board of Commissioners meeting, where the board majority passed a 4-1 resolution censuring Wiley for conduct unbecoming of an elected official, following Wileys admission earlier in the month that some North Bergen employees painted his house the previous year, explaining that it was part of a [...] "shared services" [...] agreement with North Bergen. At the same meeting Wiley threatened to file a civil suit against West New York for threatening to dissolve his office. Wiley also charged that a resolution to place Roques sister, Aida Roque on the towns Planning Board was a conflict of interest.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>my</b> predecessors, {{grandfather}} and grandmother included, {{not only as}} a matter of course, but with sincere filial attachment; and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> Miss Mary Wallace, or aunt Mary, as I had been taught to call her, quite as much on account of her quiet, gentle, affectionate manner, as from habit; and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> Major Dirck Follock as a sort of hereditary friend, as a distant relative, and a good and careful guardian of my own youth and inexperience on a thousand occasions; and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> negro man, Jaap, as we all love faithful slaves, however unnurtured they may be; but Andries was the man whom <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> without knowing why. He was illiterate almost to greatness, having the drollest notions imaginable of this earth and all it contained; was anything but refined in deportment, though hearty and frank; had prejudices so crammed into his moral system that there {{did not seem to be}} room for anything else; and was ever so little addicted, moreover, to that species of Dutch jollification, which had cost old Colonel Van Valkenburgh his life, and a love for which was a good deal spread throughout the colony. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> really <b>loved</b> this man, and when we were all disbanded at the peace, or in 1783, by which time I had myself risen to the rank of captain, I actually parted from old Andries with tears in my eyes. My grandfather, General Littlepage, was then dead, but government giving to most of us a step, by means of brevet rank, at the final breaking up of the army, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who had been the full colonel of the regiment for the last year, bore the title of brigadier for the remainder of his days. It was pretty much all he got for seven years of dangers and arduous services. But the country was poor, and we had fought more for principles than for the hope of rewards. It must be admitted that America ought to be full of philosophy, inasmuch as so much of her system of rewards and even of punishments, is purely theoretical, and addressed to the imagination, or to the qualities of the mind. Thus it is that we contend with all our enemies on very unequal grounds. The Englishman has his knighthood, his baronetcies, his peerages, his orders, his higher ranks in the professions, his batons, and all the other venial inducements of our corrupt nature to make him fight, while the American is goaded on to glory by the abstract considerations of virtue and patriotism. After all, we flog quite as often as we are flogged, which is the main interest affected. While on this subject I will remark that Andries Coejemans never assumed the empty title of major, which was so graciously bestowed on him by the Congress of 1783, but left the army a captain in name, without half-pay or anything but his military lot, to find a niece whom he was bringing up, and to pursue his old business of a [...] "chainbearer." ...|$|R

Well, I robbed a priest of a few pence, and was outlawed; he plunders and burns a whole minster, and is made a great earl for if.
