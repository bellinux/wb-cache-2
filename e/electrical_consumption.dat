5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> with renewable resources by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E
25|$|Large {{solar power}} {{photovoltaic}} cell arrays or thermal power plants {{would be needed}} to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 megawatt-hours per person per year.) These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with wireless power transmission.|$|E

Research by the University of Oxford has shown that the average annual <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> for lighting in a UK home fell from 720kWh in 1997 to 508kWh in 2012.

40|$|It is {{important}} for building owners and operators to manage the <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption</b> of their buildings. As electrical energy is the major form of energy consumed in a commercial building, the ability to forecast <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in a building will bring great benefits to the building owners and operators. This paper provides {{a review of the}} building <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption</b> forecasting methods which include the conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The significant goal {{of this study is to}} review, recognize, and analyse the performance of both methods for forecasting of <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Compared to using a single method of forecasting, the hybrid of two forecasting methods can possibly be applied for more precise results. Regarding this potential, the swarm intelligence (SI) method has been reviewed to be hybridized with AI.

[...] In 2010, the college was {{named one of}} 15 colleges in the United States to the [...] "Green Honor Roll", by Princeton Review. Bates currently mitigates 99% of emissions via <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> and purchases all of its energy from Maine Renewable Resources. The college expended $1.1 million of its endowment to install lighting retrofits, occupancy sensors, motor system replacements and energy generating mechanisms. Select buildings at the college are open 24/7, thus requiring extra energy, due to this the college has implemented technology that places buildings on [...] "stand-by" [...] mode while minimum occupancy is attained to preserve energy. The practice is set to reduce the college's overall emissions levels by 5 to 10 percent. Overall, the academic buildings and residential halls are equipped with daylighting techniques, motion sensors, and efficient heating systems. Bates expended $1.5 million to implement a central plant that provides steam for heating for up to 80% of all on-campus establishments. The central plant {{is equipped with a}} modernized biomass systems and a miniature back-pressure steam turbine which reduces campus electricity consumption by 5%. The college also installed a $2.7 million 900kW hyper-roterized turbine that accounts for nearly one tenth of the campus' entire energy consumption. Bates was the first food-service operation in higher education to join the Green Restaurant Association. In 2013, the environmental practices of the college's dining services were placed along with Harvard University, and Northeastern University, as the best in the United States by the Green Restaurant Association; it earned three out of three stars, the only educational institution in Maine to do so.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- By {{undertaking}} a cointegration {{analysis with}} annual data {{over the period}} 1985 ~ 2005 in China, the estimation results {{show that there is}} cointegration relationship between <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and economic growth taking into account industry structure changes and technical efficiency. The model shows that three explanatory variables, the GDP per capita, heavy industry share and efficiency improvement are the crucial factors which influence the electric energy consumption. The three explanatory variables and the actual <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumption</b> are input into a support vector machine(SVM), a Gaussian radial basis function is taken as the kernel function and <b>electrical</b> energy <b>consumptions</b> from 1994 ~ 2006 are forecasted.

50|$|The primary {{criticism}} for the household electricity approach, {{as well as}} other <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> approaches, centers around the assumptions made regarding the stability of the consistency of <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> with GDP. Critics suggest that levels of stability can be altered significantly by the omission of such basic factors as shifts in the weather (Hanousek and Palda 2004, p. 14). The authors of <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> approaches have admittedly been aware of the weakness of their assumptions and have made attempts to control for factors that would make <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> inconsistent with GDP; however, critics do not see these attempts as being adequate enough (Hanousek and Palda 2006, p. 709).|$|E

For Lacko’s original study the parameters were focused around estimates of cross-sections from nineteen OECD countries in 1990, nineteen OECD countries in 1989 and panel data for 1989-1990(Lacko 2000, p. 362).

It was evident, as noted by Dobozi and Pohl, that change within the GDP resulted in lockstep changes with <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> for market economies; however, Kaufman and Kaliberda also noted that the former Soviet bloc countries did not seem to maintain this consistency. The researchers suggested that the transitional nature of these countries' economic development created a break in the consistency between GDP and <b>electrical</b> <b>consumption</b> (Lacko 2000, p. 350).
