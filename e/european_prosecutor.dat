Conde-Pumpido, speaking with the President of the Commission of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, and the Spanish State Secretary for the European Union (EU), Diego Lopez Garrido, presented a technical project, developed from the conclusions of the International Conference convened by the Spanish Prosecutor in 2008 and 2009, which would be discussed later in the Luxembourg Council.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} EPPO is to {{investigate}} and prosecute fraud against the EU budget and other crimes against the EU's financial interests including fraud concerning EU funds of over €10,000 and cross-border VAT fraud cases involving damages above €10 million. Previously only national authorities could investigate and prosecute these crimes and could not act beyond their borders. OLAF, Eurojust and Europol similarly had no ability to act. The body {{is intended to be}} decentralized, based around <b>European</b> Delegated <b>Prosecutors</b> located in each Member State. The central office will have a <b>European</b> Chief <b>Prosecutor</b> supported by 20 <b>European</b> <b>Prosecutors,</b> technical and investigatory staff. The EPPO may request a suspect's arrest, but this must be confirmed by the relevant national authority.|$|R

50|$|The EU, however, {{does not}} have a single constitution, a single government, a single foreign policy set by that government, a single {{taxation}} system contributing to a single exchequer, or a single military. There {{is no such thing as}} a single European justice system, let alone a <b>European</b> <b>prosecutor</b> who could enforce European Union law in European trial courts independent of the courts of individual member states. There are no European trial judges who have sworn loyalty to Europe over loyalty to their home countries, and no European prisons. Without its own independent courts and prisons, the European Union's ability to curb corruption in member states is severely limited (especially in contrast to the federal government of the United States).|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{influence}} of Community law over national criminal law {{is difficult to}} be solved even now, because criminal law is very closely related to state sovereignty. However, at European level it {{is a series of}} unifying trends in the field of criminal law. This includes: the Corpus Juris Project to develop a number of guiding principles on the protection through criminal law of financial interests of EU, within the European judiciary space; the project of founding a <b>European</b> <b>Prosecutor,</b> which would have extended jurisdiction over the entire European judicial area; at the doctrinaire level the project called ”The Criminal Code of the European Union ” result of encoding the provisions relevant for the Community criminal law and published likewise. Romanian criminal law could not remain outside these trends and this paper reveal some internal acts that reflect the trends observed at European level. Some of this acts have a direct influence, and some of them an indirect influence. An example is represented by art. 3022 of the Romanian Penal Code, which, in the basic variant, besides any operations regarding the import of wastes and residue of any kind or other dangerous goods for public health and environment, incriminates the placing or transit operations on the country without observing the laws. In this text, the phrase "without observing the laws" must be reported to both national regulations and international legal instruments...|$|E

40|$|Establishing a new European body, namely, <b>European</b> Public <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office, {{could be}} {{described}} as one of the sensitive issues currently under discussion within the European Union, especially {{in the context of the}} serious economic crisis that hit in the last 5 years both the European Union and the national economies, as well as their difficult recovery.

The author’s conviction is that if agreed to be establish, this new body could change Europe’s judicial landscape, from various reasons. One of these reasons is that this new <b>European</b> Public <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office will constitute a network of around 100 prosecutors in charge to investigate and prosecute suspects for defrauding EU funding programs...|$|R
