But the actress was eager to return for the show's second season. But during the second season the role was expanded which surprised Rosenblat. The actress told a reporter from Indiewire, [...] "I learned where Miss Rosa is from I learned why she's in prison. You're going {{to learn a lot}} about her, a lot that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>desperate</b> to know, and it helps." [...] In March 2014, series creator Jenji Kohan told Jessie Katz (The Hollywood Reporter) that viewers would be introduced to Miss Rosa's backstory. When the writers had planned a backstory episode for the character, Rosenblat was delighted. But the development left her unsure how Miss Rosa's story would fit into main storyline of Orange Is the New Black.|$|E

In the end, I fell, and in one wild orgy undid all the good of a month's abstinence. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>desperate</b> then.
