40|$|Abstract The {{atmospheric}} {{influence on}} sound propagation {{along the ground}} sur-face is a critical issue for estimating the noise impact of industrial plants or road networks. Indeed, sound refraction in the surface layer has a dramatic impact on the geographical acoustic exposure. Many analytical and numerical models and stud-ies based on {{the laws of physics}} are available in scientific papers whereas very few works in statistical analysis have been attempted. However several important practical issues need to be considered. Among these, time and space represen-tativity of “in situ ” measurements, sampling design, influence of meteorological and ground parameters on acoustic exposure show to be a few challenges. They need to be investigated with statistical tools taking into account space and time autocorrelation. A new protocol which includes ground impedance monitoring, spatial micro-meteorological and acoustical characterization has been applied to an experimental campaign from June to August 2005 in a case of sound propagation from a point sound source on a grassy flat ground. The first <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study</b> on such a multi-variable experimental database is presented.

30|$|It {{is not an}} easy task, if not impossible, to {{visualize}} or to describe raw data when it is in a digital form. This is, especially, true for data sets from oil reservoirs because of the large number of points. Therefore, raw data must be organized and presented in the form of charts, diagrams or tables in order to give a clear picture of the phenomena it represents. Statistics is the science which deals with the collection, organization, presentation, and summary of data. Therefore, statistical analysis is considered as an essential step in any <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study.</b> The univariate statistical analysis provides several parameters and helps to determine the type of distribution of the data set. Statistical parameters including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, standard deviation, lower and upper quartiles and coefficient of variation were computed for each well and for zone B of the Shurijeh formation which is under consideration. These parameters are very useful for determining the general behavior of the data distribution. Parameters like the mean and the median provide information about the location of center of mass for distribution. The variance and the standard deviation quantify the variability of the data values and indicate how the data are distributed around the mean. In addition to these parameters, the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, was also calculated. This parameter provides a measure of the relative variability of the data.|$|E

Lithological key units control the effectiveness of the ore forming processes, affecting the in situ ore reserve, The Kwaggashoek East deposit is the product of primary and secondary processes. A genetic model focussed on the source, migration and deposition of iron suggests a possible original source of iron as the product of very dilute hydrothermal input into deep ocean waters, with subsequent migration through structural conduits. Supergene processes account for the upgrading of the ore and the phosphorus redistribution. A good correlation between samples in a preliminary <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study</b> reflects the effectiveness of this process in the high grade ore zone. A broad overview of the economic issues which affect the commercialization of iron, indicates a balanced supply-demand situation for the five next years.

The objective {{of this study was to}} construct a categorization for the spatial dependence index (SDI) proposed by Seidel and Oliveira (2014) in order to classify spatial variability in terms of weak, moderate, and strong dependence. Theoretical values were constructed from different degrees of spatial dependence, which served as a basis for calculation of the SDI. In view of the form of distribution and SDI descriptive measures, we developed a categorization for posterior classification of spatial dependence, specific to each semivariogram model. The SDI categorization was based on its median and 3 rd quartile, allowing us to classify spatial dependence as weak, moderate, or strong. We established that for the spherical semivariogram: SDISpherical (%) &# 8804; 7 % (weak spatial dependence), 7 % 15 % (strong spatial dependence); for the exponential semivariogram: SDIExponential (%) &# 8804; 6 % (weak spatial dependence), 6 % 13 % (strong spatial dependence); and for the Gaussian semivariogram: SDIGaussian (%) &# 8804; 9 % (weak spatial dependence), 9 % 20 % (strong spatial dependence).

40|$|Ground motions {{recorded}} within sedimentary basins are variable over short distances. One important {{cause of}} the variability is that local soil properties are variable at all scales. Regional hazard maps developed for predicting site effects are generally derived from maps of surficial geology; however, {{recent studies have shown}} that mapped geologic units do not correlate well with the average shear-wave velocity of the upper 30 m, Vs(30). We model the horizontal variability of near-surface soil shear-wave velocity in the San Francisco Bay Area to estimate values in unsampled locations in order to account for site effects in a continuous manner. Previous <b>geostatistical</b> <b>studies</b> of soil properties have shown horizontal correlations at the scale of meters to tens of meters while the vertical correlations are on the order of centimeters. In this paper we analyze shear-wave velocity data over regional distances and find that surface shear-wave velocity is correlated at horizontal distances up to 4 km based on data from seismic cone penetration tests and the spectral analysis of surface waves. We propose a method to map site effects by using geostatistical methods based on the shear-wave velocity correlation structure within a sedimentary basin. If used in conjunction with densely spaced shear-wave velocity profiles in regions of high seismic risk, geostatistical methods can produce reliable continuous maps of site effects...|$|R
30|$|To {{avoid any}} speculations about {{what types of}} {{deterministic}} and/or stochastic processes govern the EEG signals, we will use here some properties of these signals that depend on processes underlying them but do not require knowing their exact nature. The one-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) of the absolute increments of scaled multichannel resting state EEG signals calculated {{over a wide range}} of temporal separation (time lags) may be used as one of the properties [24]. It is not sufficient to infer the EEG dynamics, but it is enough to capture some of its features. It {{should be noted that the}} moment of order p of the relevant distribution represents the structure functions (SFs) of order p at a given time lag. The term “structure function” as such was proposed by Obukhov [25] but Kolmogorov [26, 27] was the first to introduce the formal definition of the second- and third-order SFs under a theoretical analysis of velocity difference of a turbulent fluid. Kolmogorov’s second-order SF is also known today as the variogram. The latter has been widely used for many years to quantify the spatial variability of spatial phenomena for many years in <b>geostatistical</b> <b>studies</b> (e.g., Gringarten and Deutsch [28]) as well as to describe a pseudo-periodic signal [29]. It is important that the SF approach is applicable to non-stationary time series.

40|$|Numerous soil gas {{measurements}} of four gaseous species {{with very different}} geochemical behaviors were performed in the Fucino Basin, an area characterized by known and inferred structural discontinuities. A comprehensive statistical and geostatistical treatment of these data followed {{in order to provide}} insight into the spatial influence of tectonic discontinuities and geology on deep-seated gas migration toward the surface. The results yielded anomalies with different features, reflecting the different gas-bearing properties of the eastern seismogenic faults related to the 1915 earthquake (Mb = 7. 0) and the hidden structural features occurring in the western side of the plain. In particular, this approach demonstrates that soil gas concentration (i. e., Rn and CO 2) can identify the simpler normal faults of the eastern sector of the plain. In contrast, the more pervasive fracturing and faulting, as well as the occurrence of coarser deposits, on the western side of the area, make the location of faults less clear. The results show that gases migrate preferentially through zones of brittle deformation by advective processes, as suggested by the relatively high rate of migration needed to obtain anomalies of shortlived 222 Rn in the soil pores. Furthermore, a <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study</b> of soil gas data was conducted to quantify the spatial domain of correlation and the gas-bearing properties of faults on the basis of shallow soil gas distribution (i. e., anisotropic behavior).

40|$|Abstract—Ground-level {{tropospheric ozone}} {{is one of}} the air {{pollutants}} of most concern. It is mainly produced by photochemical processes involving nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the lower parts of the atmosphere. Ozone levels become particularly high in regions close to high ozone precursor emissions and during summer, when stagnant meteorological conditions with high insolation and high temperatures are common. In this work, some results of a study about urban ozone distribution patterns in the city of Badajoz, which is the largest and most industrialized city in Extremadura region (southwest Spain) are shown. Fourteen sampling campaigns, at least one per month, were carried out to measure ambient air ozone concentrations, during periods that were selected according to favourable conditions to ozone production, using an automatic portable analyzer. Later, to evaluate the ozone distribution at the city, the measured ozone data were analyzed using geostatistical techniques. Thus, first, during the exploratory analysis of data, it was revealed that they were distributed normally, which is a desirable property for the subsequent stages of the <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study.</b> Secondly, during the structural analysis of data, theoretical spherical models provided the best fit for all monthly experimental variograms. The parameters of these variograms (sill, range and nugget) revealed that the maximum distance of spatial dependence is between 302 - 790 m and the variable, air ozone concentration, is not evenly distributed in reduced distances. Finally, predictive ozone maps were derived for all points of the experimental study area, by use of geostatistical algorithms (kriging). High prediction accuracy was obtained in all cases as cross-validation showed. Useful information for hazard assessment was also provided when probability maps, based on kriging interpolation and kriging standard deviation, were produced.

40|$|The HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) {{technique}} {{is very popular}} {{in the context of}} seismic microzonation and for the mapping of shallow seismic reflectors, such as the sediment/bedrock transition surface. This easy-to-deploy single station passive seismic technique permits the collection of a considerable amount of HVSR data in a cost-effective way. It is not surprising that some recent studies have adopted single station micro-tremor analyses in order to retrieve information on geological structures in 1 D, 2 D or even 3 D reconstructions. However, the interpolation approaches followed in these studies for extending the punctual HVSR data spatially are not supported by a detailed spatial statistical analysis. Conversely, in order to exploit the informative content and quantify the related uncertainty of HVSR data it is necessary to utilize a deep spatial statistical analysis and objective interpolation approaches. Moreover, the interpolation approach should make it possible to use expert knowledge and auxiliary information. Accordingly, we present an integrated geostatistical approach applied to HVSR data, collected for retrieving information on the morphology of a buried bedrock surface. The <b>geostatistical</b> <b>study</b> is conducted on an experimental dataset of 116 HVSR data collected in a small thermal basin located in the Venetian Plain (Caldiero Basin, N-E Italy). The explorative geostatistical analysis of the data coupled with the use of interpolation kriging techniques permit the extraction of relevant information on the resonance properties of the subsoil. The utilized approach, based on kriging with external drift (or its extension, i. e. regression kriging), permits the researcher to take into account auxiliary information, evaluate the related prediction uncertainty, and highlight abrupt variations in subsoil resonance frequencies. The results of the analysis are discussed, also with reflections pertaining to the geo-engineering and geo-environmental context...|$|E
40|$|The Bierwang Field {{has been}} used for gas storage for around 20 years. To obtain a better {{understanding}} of the storage performance of the field, Ruhrgas acquired 3 D seismic data and has undertaken a full field integrated <b>geostatistical</b> modeling <b>study</b> to obtain high resolution reservoir flow models. These models form the basis for dynamic modeling. A multi-disciplinary approach to the modeling was taken with special attention paid to proper integration of seismic with petrophysical and geological data to improve the confidence in the final reservoir models. The full 3 D reservoir models incorporate structure, volumetrics, and properties for dynamic flow modeling (porosity and permeability) based on a detailed rock lithofacies model. Multiple models were generated using geostatistical simulation to capture modeling uncertainty. This set of final static reservoir models were transformed from a seismic grid representation to a cell-based POSC RESCUE (REServoir Characterization Using Epicentre) geologic model format to facilitate transfer to the reservoir model upscaler...|$|R
40|$|Many {{hydrological}} {{and ecological}} studies {{recognize the importance}} of characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation. In this <b>study,</b> <b>geostatistical</b> methodologies were developed in order to estimate a hydro-meteorological factor by (re) building the space-time distribution of the precipitation associated to monthly averages in a certain hydrological river basin that will be used in the modelling of surface water quality. A hydro-meteorological factor is constructed for each water quality monitoring site (WQMS), based on the analysis of the space-time behaviour of the precipitation observed in an udometric network located in a Portuguese river basin.

A 250 x 100 m plot (approximately 2. 35 ha) was divided into grids with 25 x 25 m spacing that included 51 sampling points from 0 - 0. 2 m in depth. Soil reaction (pH) was the least variable property while the Ex-K was the most variable. The greatest range of influence (237. 6 m) occurred for Ex-Ca and the least range (49. 7 m) for Ex-Mg...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of mineral}} grades of an {{industrial}} mineral deposit (talcum) {{are used in}} a <b>geostatistical</b> case <b>study.</b> The data available come from a quality sampling scheme of the operating mine and can be assigned to two stoping layers each 3 m thick. The aim {{of the study is}} to establish a quality model {{on the basis of the}} mined blocks of the deposit. This will be used in the direct control of the extraction sequence of the blocks to guarantee certain average grades in the raw material for further treatment. A structural analysis (variogramming) shows certain trends, high nugget e€ect and high variances in the classi®ed data sets. By removing a certain trend and introducing a multiplication factor, a consistent model for both stoping layers can be established. This is further used to calculate extrapolated point values by kriging at the known sampling points in the second layer for validation of the model. To establish the quality model for planning the extraction sequences, block values on grid nodes according to the extraction scheme also have been extrapolated for the second and third stoping layers. # 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
