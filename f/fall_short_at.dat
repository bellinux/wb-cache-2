40|$|Pressure {{transients}} {{are caused}} by {{a change in the}} volumetric flow in a pipeline system, and can have severe consequences for rapid changes of the volumetric flow. A sudden closure of a valve is a common source of a pressure transient, and the pressure increase in front of the valve depends on the flow rate and the wave propagation velocity in the fluid and pipe. A gas-liquid mixture can have a very low wave propagation velocity, even for small air contents, and is effective in terms of damping due to the compressibility effects of the gas bubbles. With these alterations of the fluid properties the pressure transient will be weakened with reduced amplitude and an increased period, which are beneficial effects for the pipeline system. A simple experiment was carried out to investigate the practical solutions for the air injection system, and the results showed that the presence of air was beneficial in terms of a reduction of the amplitude and increased damping of the pressure transient. However, a few aspects should be revised in a refinement of the experiment. The air flow rate and duration were uncertain because of water accumulating in the air hose, and the timing of the gate valve closure was challenging. Simulations of various models of pipe systems were carried out in Flowmaster. The models are sufficient for simulation of ordinary pipes with a rapid closure of a valve, but <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> <b>at</b> modeling an air-water mixture.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} racial gaps in pre-collegiate {{academic}} achievement can plausibly be expected to erode {{is a matter of}} great interest and much uncertainty. In her opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, Supreme Court Justice O’Connor took a firm stand: “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary... ” We evaluate the plausibility of Justice O’Connor’s forecast, by projecting the racial composition and SAT distribution of the elite college applicant pool 25 years from now. We focus on two important margins: First, changes in the black-white relative distribution of income, and second, narrowing of the test score gap between black and white students within family income groups. Other things equal, progress on each margin can be expected to reduce the racial gap in qualifications among students pursuing admission to the most selective colleges. Under plausible assumptions, however, projected economic progress will not yield nearly as much racial diversity as is currently obtained with race-sensitive admissions. Simulations that assume additional increases in black students’ test scores, beyond those deriving from changes in family income, yield more optimistic estimates. In this scenario, race-blind rules approach the black representation among admitted students seen today at moderately selective institutions, but continue to <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> <b>at</b> the most selective schools. Maintaining a critical mass of African American students at the most selective institutions would require policies at the elementary and secondary levels or changes in parenting practices that deliver unprecedented success in narrowing the test score gap in the next quarter century. ...|$|E
40|$|Tropical forests host {{at least}} {{two-thirds of the}} world’s flora and fauna {{diversity}} and store 25 % of the terrestrial above and belowground carbon. However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> <b>at</b> addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques {{in support of the}} UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i. e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures...|$|E
