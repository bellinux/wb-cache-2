25|$|The Domain Name System {{specifies}} a set {{of various}} types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.|$|E

While by default, a player using a PlayStation 2 or an Xbox 360 uses a virtual/in-game keyboard option, the player is able to use an external keyboard that is USB compatible for communication within the game. The heads-up display in Final Fantasy XI consists of a log window, menus, and several game <b>information</b> <b>elements.</b> The log window {{at the bottom of the}} screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. [...] "Menus" [...] allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. The [...] "action command menu" [...] appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts, as well.|$|E
50|$|The first byte of the <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> Identifies (IEI) what {{information}} is to follow. The second byte of the <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> is the 'Information Element Data Length' or IEDL.

The third and subsequent bytes of the <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> are the actual information being conveyed. This is called the IED or <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> Data.|$|R

50|$|The Traffic {{indication}} map <b>information</b> <b>element</b> {{is covered}} under section 7.3.2.6 of 802.11-1999 standard. The IEEE 802.11 standards {{chose to use}} a bitmap to indicate to any sleeping listening stations if the Access Point (AP) has any buffered frames present for it. Because stations should listen {{to at least one}} beacon before the listen interval, the AP periodically sends this bitmap on its beacons as an <b>information</b> <b>element.</b> The bit mask is called the Traffic Indication Map and consists of 2008 bits, each bit representing the Association Id (AID) of a station. For example, the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element</b> allows you to transfer 1 byte up to the entire 251 bytes (2008 bits) of the TIM, you are allowed to transmit a smaller TIM bitmap as it is expected that only a few number of stations will be asleep. Because of this the bitmap values passed in the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element</b> is called a partial virtual bitmap. To allow you to transmit only a partial bitmap you must make use of the bitmap control and length fields of the TIM <b>information</b> <b>element.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mobile {{communications}} system created {{to meet the}} communication needs {{that can be done}} anywhere either when user is motionless or moving. To maintain the quality of services in a wide service area, coverage area is divided into smallest geographic units called cells. If the user moves from one area of the cell to another, then it needs an algorithm that guarantees the continuity of communications services. These algorithm is called a handover to a dedicated mode and the cell reselection for idle mode. In observing handoff algorithm, the operator did a drive test using computer and handset, which each had been equipped with special software, and GPS. This final project analyze the matters related to the handoff algorithm, both when in idle mode or dedicatd mode, including the causes, processes and things that influence it. Data acquisition is carried out through a drive test using software TEMS Investigaions GSM 4. 1. 1 with routes in the downtown area of Semarang. Drive test held on every Thursday and Sunday for three consecutive weeks starting on August 23, 2009 and each of day divided into three time allocation, ie morning, noon and night. The observed event include: cell reselection, handover, handover (intracell), handover failure and intracell handover failure. In addition <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> that effected on the event are also observed, path loss criteria and cell reselection criteria for cell reselection, and received power, bit error rate and timing advance for the four other events. From the analysis is known that the assignment channel is triggered by the <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> value that reaches a certain threshold value. For cell reselection, the both <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> having equal influence. <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> of the most influential for the handover and the handover failure is received power, whereas for two other events the most influential is the received bit error. After the detected value of the <b>Information</b> <b>Element</b> reaches a certain threshold, MSC will instruct the candidate cell to monitor and serving mobile station. Different process going on for handover (intracell), which after the <b>information</b> <b>element</b> value is known at a certain threshold, MS will move to another traffic channel in the same cell. If handover (intracell) was requested but could not be performed then handover based quality is tried the next time (if criterion is still given). When this handover also fails then BS toggles back and tries again a handover (intracell). In this drive test result there are 15 handover failures that may because no available traffic channel in candidate cell. There is only once handover intracell failure happened which may be caused by full traffic in candidate channel, but no cell reselection failure is found because this event doesnâ€™t need traffic channel but only signalling channel.
