5|$|Traditionally, {{illustrations}} of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat {{over his left}} shoulder and has two <b>kids</b> <b>under</b> his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot {{in his right hand}}. However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the <b>Kids</b> <b>under</b> his left arm. The 1488 atlas Hyginus deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. Jacob Micyllus depicted Auriga in his Hyginus of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a mule, called Mulus clitellatus by Johann Bayer. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as Adam kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effects that crossbreeding and concentrates feeding have on growth performance of goat <b>kids</b> managed <b>under</b> pasture conditions of the Romanian highlands. Experiments were carried out at the Research and Development Station for Sheep and Goats from Caransebes, in south-western Romania. The growth performances of two kids genotypes were studied, Carpatina purebreds and F 1 Boer x Carpatina crossbred <b>kids,</b> respectively. <b>Under</b> two experimental variants, with no concentrates allowance and with 300 g/day concentrates supplementation of the ration, respectively. Carpatina purebred kids had an average daily gain of 100. 7 ± 0. 03 g/day when managed exclusively on pastures (control group), while the group fed with concentrates registered growth rates of 124. 4 ± 0. 02 g/day (p≤ 0. 05). The F 1 Boer x Carpatina crossbreeds had growth rates of 145. 2 ± 0. 02 g/day when kept exclusively on pasture, while the group fed with additional concentrates registered growth rates of 211. 9 ± 0. 04 g/day (p≤ 0. 01). Genotype of the kids affected significantly (p≤ 0. 001) the growth rates, in both experimental variants. It was concluded that both crossbreeding and, to a leaser extent concentrates feeding of kids, are influencing the growth rates of fattening <b>kids</b> managed <b>under</b> highlands conditions of Romania...|$|R
