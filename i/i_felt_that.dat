5|$|I did it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all my power, because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> you were the last {{man in the world}} whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> indignant <b>that</b> Sidney Sanderson should abuse so soon my confidence.|$|R
60|$|I was {{a little}} puzzled. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{convinced}} <b>that</b> Mr. Bundercombe was concealing something from me.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} that I {{did not know}} and waited, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> {{he had something to}} say.|$|R
5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> air {{was forced}} into my mouth, I could not speak and I could not close my mouth. I could {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times I {{feel that there is}} food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she made}} her promise. And, knowing Pomona, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> she would keep it--if she could.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{apprehensive}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was personally}} {{interested in this}} dialogue, and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.|$|R
60|$|Although <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> annoyed <b>that</b> he had {{suggested}} it, still I {{made up my}} mind that Euphemia must have a servant.|$|R
25|$|Could I {{forget that}} the event in St. Peter's Square {{took place on the}} day and at the hour when the first {{appearance}} of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E
25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
25|$|In her 1973 book To Take Arms: My Life With the IRA Provisionals, former IRA member Maria McGuire {{described}} her sentiments following the Donegall Street bombing,"I admit {{at the time}} I did not connect {{with the people who}} were killed or injured in such explosions. I always judged such deaths in terms of the effect they would have on our support - and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this in turn depended on how many people accepted our explanation".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have I the {{pleasure}} of addressing Mr Buck MacGinnis?' <b>I</b> said. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> convinced <b>that</b> this could be no other than that celebrity.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled at}} me a little curiously. All the time <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>that</b> she was taking very careful note of my answers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} didn't," [...] she acknowledged. [...] "You ignored even my sweetest bow. <b>That</b> is why <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> you {{recognised}} me perfectly." ...|$|R
25|$|B {{were very}} strong characters, {{with a very}} {{specific}} type of humor and very loyal fans, {{and of course they}} were instantly identifiable. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> referencing them in Daria, while we were trying to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.|$|E
25|$|After the Finnish War, {{which ended}} when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the {{official}} capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Turku {{was too far}} from Russia and too aligned with Sweden {{to serve as the}} capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which almost completely destroyed the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.|$|E
25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. I {{consider}} the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>that</b> {{the case}} did indeed look very black against me. But would a jury venture to convict me on such very {{doubtful}} evidence? ...|$|R

25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
500|$|Chekhov {{witnessed}} much on Sakhalin {{that shocked}} and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and forced prostitution of women. He wrote, [...] "There were times <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation." [...] He was particularly {{moved by the}} plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example: ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Elson, an English support official, {{commented on}} the large {{swimming}} crowds [...] " [...] For many, {{this must have been}} a first introduction to swimming by the paralysed, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> many were wondering whether paralysed persons could swim 50 metres– how many would fail to make the distance and it was all just a stunt to enlist their sympathies and raise money". [...] The crowd's thunderous applause made the official more comfortable about the event.|$|E
6000|$|... "Delightful!" [...] Helene murmured. [...] "She is {{with you}} then, I hope. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw her the other night at the opera." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, I did not {{guess it}} at first," [...] he replied. [...] "I <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> it was Carthew {{from the first}} minute when I found that you had not landed, {{and it was just}} the luck of finding out that the Phantom's crew had returned, and that they had been paid off at Ostend, that put me on the track. Of course, {{directly}} I heard that she had been altered and turned into a brigantine, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> she was the craft that we had noticed; and as soon as I learned through Lloyd's that she had sailed south from the Lizard, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> she must have gone up the Mediterranean, or to the West Indies. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure it was the latter. However, it was a great relief when I got a letter from Lloyd's agent at Madeira, telling me that the brigantine had touched there, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should hear of you either here or at one of the South American ports." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not even then, Amy. Somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> in {{the nick}} of time her lady friend would step out from somewhere and say that the letters were hers.' ...|$|R
500|$|I love New York. But if I'm there, I {{want to go}} out, friends come to the studio, {{the phone}} rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, {{and there is no}} one I can run into. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in Capri I would be able to {{effectively}} finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [...] was becoming increasingly difficult.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on the way that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> people I knew were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E
500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E
60|$|Already <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> relieved, seeing <b>that</b> she too {{was caught}} in the spell.|$|R
