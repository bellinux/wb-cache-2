40|$|Over recent years, {{hub-and-spoke}} distribution {{techniques have}} attracted widespread research attention. Despite {{there being a}} growing body of literature in this area there is less focus on the spoke-terminal element of the hub-and-spoke system as being a key component in the overall service received by the end-user. Current literature is highly geared towards discussing bulk optimization of freight units rather than to the more discrete and individualistic profile characteristics of shared-user Less-than-truckload (LTL) freight. In this paper, a literature review is presented to review the role hub-and-spoke systems play in meeting multi-profile customer demands, particularly in developing sectors with more sophisticated needs, such as retail.

This paper not only ensures every port in the <b>hub-and</b> <b>spoke</b> port logistics network to achieve its maximum economic benefits, but also makes the entire system get the minimum total transportation cost in the view of quantitative point. In order to illustrate the validity of the model, the example was solved. The results show that the model is feasible. Furthermore, the competitiveness power of the port, the demarcation of hinterland and the traffic capacity are changed dynamically in the model, which is closer to the real system...|$|R

Integration has been the burning issue for large enterprises in the last twenty years, {{due to the fact that}} 70 % of the development and deployment budget is spent on integrating complex and heterogeneous back-end and front-end IT systems. The need to integrate existing applications is to support newer, faster, more accurate business processes and to provide meaningful, consistent management information. Historically, integration started with the introduction of point-to-point approaches evolving into simpler <b>hub-and</b> <b>spoke</b> topologies. These topologies were combined with custom remote procedure calls, distributed object technologies and message-oriented middleware (MOM), continued with enterprise application integration (EAI) and used an application server as a primary vehicle for integration. The current phase of the evolution is service-oriented architecture (SOA) combined with an enterprise service bus (ESB). Technical aspects of the comparison between the aforementioned technologies are analyzed and presented. The result of the study is the recommended integration strategy for large enterprises...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} the structure of airline networks as dominant strategies in the industry have changed. The network strategy is an integral component of the airline strategy, and network structure will be a function of demand side externalities and uncertainty, as well as supply side network economies. Network economies have predominantly been on the demand side, but in airline networks they are viewed as being for the most part on the supply side. The paper first describes the natural move to <b>hub-and</b> <b>spoke</b> (HS) systems after deregulation and the consequences of this network configuration. Network structure choice is not just a cost issue; a network can confer revenue advantages as well. We show these advantages in a discussion of low-cost carrier strategies. Next, the paper {{examines the}} current state of the airline industry and the evolution from HS to networks of connectivity. We report on the [opposing] forces that lead to such a result. The network structure ranges from fully connected, to HS to alliance (fully contracted) to middle of the road strategies, which include connectivity, and "rolling hubs. " The forces leading to the choice of each strategy are discussed as well as the future sustainable strategies of the airline industry. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of networks, they have been used amongst home users, companies and organizations and most damage on the network is due to inappropriate security configurations. To secure networks, a protocol suite {{can be used to}} encrypt and authenticate all IP packets of a session. Therefore, this report will include the advantages and possible solution of some techniques used to offer increased network security such as scalability and data confidentiality. Captures of traffic sent using the two security techniques, IPSec/VPN and GRE-Tunnel will be monitored. The objective behind this project is to configure a network with these two different tunneling techniques and compare the security and network performance. The report also describes the security problems encountered by networks such as the ignorance of network users, vulnerabilities and the security of the devices. IPSecis a standard security protocol solution for TCP/IP, and it provides security through authentication, encryption and data integrity. GRE encapsulates packets and create a logical <b>hub-and</b> <b>spoke</b> topology of virtual point-to-point connections. The Jperf-tool is used to measure network performance and show specific details while another tool, Wireshark is used to analyze the information captured during transmission of data sent using IPSEC and GRE. The comparison further finds that IPSec-tunnel technique makes data transfers very secure but causes network performance disadvantages in comparison to a GRE solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> of practice learning has been utilised within one Scottish university's undergraduate nursing programmes since 2011. Early {{findings suggest that}} generally, students exhibit a greater depth of understanding when the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model</b> is incorporated into practice learning (Roxburgh, Conlon and Banks, 2012). Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> of practice learning can present {{in a variety of}} forms but overall the approach has become generally accepted in nurse education as a 'value added' model to learning as they provide the opportunity for deeper student learning experiences that also enhance a person centred approach to nursing care. However, the quality of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> can become easily distilled. Reasons can include organisational and capacity issues of the institution and the placement provider. In addition, restrictions of placement areas, regulatory requirements and curriculum demands can all result in a very much reduced version of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model.</b> If this occurs, the practice learning experience can then become easily compressed into short, disjointed and disconnected learning experiences that prioritise the administrative and curricular demands of the programme over the quality of the student learning. Thus, the Hub and Spoke approach requires further exploration to supply robust evidence which ensures only quality interpretations of the model are available. This mixed method case study approach aims to explore the student experience of Hub and Spoke learning by deconstructing the model to identify which characteristics best benefit the student's learning. This means specifically studying the component parts of the Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model</b> that impacted on three distinct areas: 1. The students ability to connect with the person rather than the patient 2. Connection with the family of that person and in turn the wider community 3.

40|$|Background: Most of UK students' {{practice}} {{learning experience}} {{is based on}} a rotational placement model which often leads to students lacking confidence and feeling anxious about the complexities of the care environment. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>model(s)</b> of clinical practice placement across geographically diverse locations, with a particular focus on enhancing the student practice learning experience. Design: Multiple case study design. Setting & Participants: Comprised undergraduate student nurses from Adult, Learning Disability and Mental Health programmes from 3 Scottish Schools of Nursing. Methods: A mixed methods approach which included quantitative and qualitative date tools. Results: All three Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> shared two broad findings: 1) which supports the process with opportunities for individual students to be positively innovative and creative in their learning approaches. Depth of learning was achieved in two ways; a) the method in which Hub placements are organised, managed and structured and, b) the depth of empathy and sensitivity to the individual at the centre of the care. In the three Hub and <b>Spoke</b> <b>models</b> detailed in this paper, there is a continuum of student led learning 2) Engagement of mentors/enhanced student/mentor relationship.
