5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} on domestic routes is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines <b>first</b> <b>have</b> to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of this practice is Indonesia AirAsia, a branch of Malaysian AirAsia; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month of}} {{classroom}} instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should <b>first</b> <b>have</b> some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity {{at a much lower}} cost, but voters would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls {{are covered}} in small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls {{are covered in}} rows of large ventral plates. During early stages of development, they <b>first</b> <b>have</b> only small, rounded scales. Fossils show, as the animals grew, the scales on the undersides of their bodies {{developed}} into large, wide ventral plates. The plates overlap {{each other in a}} way that allows a wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, have no evidence of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration, the absorption of oxygen through the skin.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E

25|$|The Canary creeper (Tropaeolum peregrinum) is a {{trailing}} {{and climbing}} half-hardy annual species with wiry stalks and palmately lobed leaves.

25|$|There {{are limited}} cases where {{portions}} of a confession may be revealed to others, but {{always with the}} penitent's permission and always without actually revealing the penitent's identity.

25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would <b>first</b> <b>have</b> to install and configure drivers to support either expanded memory specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E
25|$|Almost all the torrejones are {{in areas}} now {{uninhabited}} (except those in Castrejón and Alaejos, {{both of which}} were turned into castles, in later history). The torrejones were relatively simple square or egg-shaped structures, with several floors, built of limestone or brick. At least two categories of torrejones can be identified: The <b>first</b> <b>have</b> small peepholes in their walls and are built in regions that were in isolated areas at the time of use, and the other are small castles located in what were rural farming villages (though today they are deserted).|$|E

25|$|Terrestrial Climate zones <b>first</b> <b>have</b> {{been defined}} by Wladimir Köppen {{based on the}} {{distribution}} of vegetation groups. Climate classification is furthermore based on temperature, rainfall, and subdivided based upon differences in the seasonal distribution of temperature and precipitation; and a separate group exists for extrazonal climates like in high altitudes. Mars has neither vegetation nor rainfall, so any climate classification could be only based upon temperature; a further refinement of the system may be based on dust distribution, water vapor content, occurrence of snow. Solar Climate Zones can also be easily defined for Mars.|$|E
25|$|Frist {{graduated}} from Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, {{and then from}} Princeton University in 1974, where he specialized in health care policy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. In 1972, he held a summer internship with Tennessee Congressman Joe L. Evins, who advised Frist that {{if he wanted to}} pursue a political career, he should <b>first</b> <b>have</b> a career outside politics. Frist proceeded to Harvard Medical School, where he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine with honors in 1978. While at Harvard he shared an apartment with future United States Congressman David Wu.|$|E
25|$|The Red Army had {{originally}} sowed confusion among the locals {{by claiming that}} they were arriving to save Poland from the Nazis. Their advance surprised Polish communities and their leaders, {{who had not been}} advised how to respond to a Bolshevik invasion. Polish and Jewish citizens may at <b>first</b> <b>have</b> preferred a Soviet regime to a German one, but the Soviets soon proved as hostile and destructive towards the Polish people and their culture as the Nazis. They began confiscating, nationalising and redistributing all private and state-owned Polish property. During the two years following the annexation, they arrested approximately 100,000 Polish citizens and deported between 350,000 and 1,500,000, of whom between 150,000 and 1,000,000 died, mostly civilians.|$|E
