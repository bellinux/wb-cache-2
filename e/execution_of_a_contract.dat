40|$|Customer pre-signing of all {{transactional}} {{documents in}} one sitting is a questionable procedure as {{it does not follow}} the required sequence in the Shariah concept of “offer and acceptance”. As “offer and acceptance” or “ijab and qabul” (i. e. sighah) is, according to the vast majority of scholars, an absolute requirement of exchange contracts and can be executed only after the seller possesses the contracted item. Pre-signing in normal circumstances has been seen as either a promise from one party to purchase or to sell, or as an execution of contract without proper ownership by contracting parties. Hence, the study is integral in order to analyse the permissibility of considering pre-signing as offer and acceptance. Furthermore, it is assumed that any non-compliance issues in the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> will affect its validity. Therefore, this study aims to explain the Shariah view on the sequence of contract execution in Islamic banking products, and the Islamic banks' practices in executing contracts in vehicle financing, house financing and personal financing. The paper applies the qualitative research method comprising of document analyses, fiqh muqaran and interviews with the stakeholders. This paper suggests that “offer and acceptance” should be done in a proper manner as described by Islamic jurists and that modern technology, especially communication technology, should be used to overcome pre-signing needs.

One of the popular recommendations is arbitration. This aim of this study is to study the process and procedures of arbitration as a method for disputes resolution, to identify and also analyze the causes of disputes and its solution techniques {{in construction}} industry. The questionnaires will be distributed by hand to all types of contractors limited to area in Kuala Lumpur and Kuantan.

Moreover,it is hoped that these findings can be used to overcome disputes that cause all the problems in Malaysian construction industry and hopefully will give new point of view on arbitration as a resolution technique to the contractors and construction industry in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|An organization's {{decision}} on which aspects of its operations to outsource represents a key, strategic issue {{that should be}} based on maximizing performance throughout the entire value chain. In certain instances strategic outsourcing decisions make it ideal for firms to source from one particular supplier. Singlesource relationships, in particular, necessitate strategic contract development to ensure incentives are aligned throughout the value chain. Much of the existing research in contract development focuses on mitigating fluctuations in demand. Forecasting demand is highly uncertain and can lead to inefficiencies throughout the value chain that contracts can alleviate. However, the defense industry typically has low uncertainty in demand, which offers a unique environment to study contract development. This thesis focuses on contract development with certain demand through case studies in the defense industry. The essence of this thesis revolves around a strategic framework for developing contracts. This framework begins with a discussion of methods for performing a strategic analysis of suppliers. Next an overview of investigating supplier alternatives is provided. The framework then addresses the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> which includes writing and negotiating the contract. Finally, contract maintenance is discussed, which includes contract validation as well as managing latent concerns. After the framework is laid out, four different single-source supplier relationships are analyzed. Each of these supplier relationships is investigated to understand the motivation for initiating these particular relationships. The four supplier case studies revolve around the issues of supplier investment costs, internal competition, commodity negotiations, and supplier power. After each case study, the pertinent aspects of the contract development framework are applied to the specific supplier relationship and conclusions are drawn. by Kevin Resch. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{establish}} in what way the legislator has distributed the so-called carriage risk between the parties to the contract under the new carriage law. With this purpose in mind, certain issues regarding the liability of the carrier, of a more general character, have been analised, as well as those concerning specific types of rights to which persons using carriage services are entitled. Such a formulation of the problem enables a simultaneous discussion of the liability deriving from an inadequate execution of both, a carriage contract of persons and that of things. One might discuss the distribution of the carriage risk by means of an analysis of the different types of rights to which the contracting parties are entitled, {{in the event of a}} lack of exucution or an inadequate execution of carriage services. Among the rights aiming at a proper change in the legal relationship there is noticeable a right to validate performance through the so-called execution by substitution. The contents of this right will in practice be dependent on the interpretation of the concept of "circumstances rendering the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> in accordance with its terms, impossible". Unfortunately, the Act does not provide for those rights of travellers, the realization of which would lead to making the payment for services conform to a decreased performance value. In this situation, it seems necessary to enlarge upon the postulate of basing legal sanctions in such cases on general principles. We are concerned here with those stiuations in which the carrier charges an additional payment for a special standard of the services. The party to the carriage contract is also entitled to rights of a nullifying character, as for e. g. the right to renounce a contract. In the new act, there is a regulation guaranteeing a return of undue performance and a return to the precontractural state in those situations, when further travel has hecome pointless for the contracting party. The lack of execution or the inadequate execution of a resolution by the carrier, might be the cause of a damage to the contracting party's property. A distribution of the risk of bearing the negative consequences of such developments weighing upon the parties to the carriage contract, depends on the contents of the specific preconditions of indemnity liability, such as 1) a breach of the contents of the relationship resulting from an obligation linking the parties, 2) the lack of circumstances exempting the carrier from liability, 3) the appearance of damages, 4) the existence of a causal nexus between the lack of execution and the damage, 5) the contents of the indemnity liability of the carrier. The problems of the carrier's indemnity liability, which appear at the reading of the new carriage law have been discussed in the above order.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers which contribute to the literatures on regulation and organizational economics. The {{first part of the}} dissertation addresses questions related to the procurement decisions of private and public organizations. In particular it focuses on how the anticipation of renegotiating the contractual terms during the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> procurement <b>contract</b> affects the initial arrangements between the parties. Renegotiation may involve the design itself of the goods which are procured, and not just their price or the time <b>of</b> their delivery. <b>A</b> plausible explanation for its pervasiveness is the existence of transaction costs which prevents contracts from being complete. This is especially true for more sophisticated and customized goods, such as new infrastructures or cars' and aircrafts' parts or components. Ex-post these goods may fail to fit the buyer's specific needs and/or may exhibit flaws unforeseen at the planning stage. In the first two chapters, I show that the anticipation of ex-post adaptations has critical implications for many procurement choices, such as that of the contractual agreement, the award mechanism, and the delegation of the design task to the suppliers. Therefore, <b>a</b> proper inclusion <b>of</b> design failures into the analysis of procurement contracts can help broaden our understanding of the wide variety of procurement modes and outcomes observed in the real world. My analysis offers an explanation for the procurement practices adopted in complex manufacturing and construction industries. Moreover, it can provide useful guidance for public procurement. Governments face tight restrictions in their choices of the procurement modes and for this reason they should carefully evaluate whether or not to adopt the best practices of the private sector. The second part of the dissertation concerns the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organization. In many organizations the task <b>of</b> evaluating <b>an</b> agent's performance is delegated to a third party, a supervisor, who can opportunistically misreport information. The question of how the provision of incentives in hierarchies is affected by the supervisor's opportunism is of great importance since it can improve our understanding of the internal organization of firms and can have broad applications to regulatory design. The third chapter of the thesis, co-authored with Luca Livio (ECARES, FNRS), contributes to this line of research by studying the optimal task a supervisor should be charged with in the presence of corruption concerns. We highlight the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade-off between monitoring the agent's effort choice and auditing it ex-post, which arises when the two faces of corruption, collusion and extortion, are present.

However, there is <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> formal study {{on the behavior of}} users in these systems, which leaves the correctness and security of such system without a solid foundation. Unlike mining, in which the reward for mining a block is fixed, different <b>execution</b> results <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smart <b>contract</b> may lead to significantly different payoffs of users, which gives more incentives for some user to follow a branch that contains a wrong result, even if the branch is shorter. It is thus important to understand the exact probability that a branch is being selected by the system. We formulate this problem as the (+-) -Biased Ballot Problem as follows: there are n voters one by one voting for either of the two candidates A and B. The probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user voting for A or B depends on whether the difference between the current votes <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and B is positive or negative. Our model takes into account the behavior of three different kinds <b>of</b> users when <b>a</b> branch occurs in the system [...] users having preference over a certain branch based on the history of their transactions, and users being indifferent and simply follow the longest chain. We study two important probabilities that are closely related with a blockchain based system - the probability that A wins at last, and the probability that A receives d votes first. We show how to recursively calculate the two probabilities for any fixed n and d, and also discuss their asymptotic values when n and d are sufficiently large...|$|R
40|$|Most honors {{programs}} offer multiple {{options for}} scholars {{to complete their}} honors credits each semester. Students may, for instance, take honors courses on campus or abroad, participate in honors independent study, or take upper-division courses as freshmen or sophomores. In some cases, especially if a scholar has a scheduling conflict between courses required for the major and honors courses, {{he or she may}} select to develop <b>an</b> honors <b>contract,</b> allowing the student to take a non-honors course and work with the faculty instructor to develop an honors experience in the course. At our institution, honors students must complete <b>a</b> minimum <b>of</b> six honors credits per academic year. Of the fifty honors students enrolled in our honors program, approximately ten each semester satisfy honors requirements through honors contracts (called “honors options” on our campus). We communicate that the honors contract is not supposed to be an add-on to the routine assignments but should provide alternatives to {{some or all of the}} assignments. The honors contract should not simply require more work but should go more deeply into methodology, structure, and theory; attack more sophisticated questions; and satisfy more rigorous standards than are generally expected for the non-honors students. Honors contract advisers, who are the instructors for the course, commonly design the <b>contract</b> as <b>an</b> inquiry- or community-based project. Such projects are typically rigorous enough to then qualify for presentation at a conference. Although the honors contract may be the only opportunity for a student to satisfy the honors credit requirements in a semester, several challenges may occur with the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> honors <b>contract</b> project. Some projects may not get started until well after the semester has begun if, for instance, a student needs to learn appropriate content knowledge before knowing how to proceed or if there is a delay in getting institutional review board (IRB) approval to work with human subjects. Unanticipated changes may occur in access to necessary resources; a scheduled interview with a distinguished speaker may become impossible, for instance, because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cancelled campus visit. Most often, we see that there is not enough time in the semester to complete the honors contract project. Everything from lab work to the construction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art installation can take longer than anticipated. As a semester draws to a close, a scholar may become frustrated in not being able to complete the honors contract or may not produce the quality work of which he/she is capable because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm deadline to earn a grade in the course. No motivation or incentive usually exists for a scholar and the supervising faculty member to continue <b>an</b> honors <b>contract</b> project beyond the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> semester. Once the course concludes, students receive a grade for their honors contract work that is averaged into their overall course grade. Students cannot earn any additional honors contract credits for the same project since it was tied into a specific course. However, there may be an opportunity for students to continue the project in a future semester as an honors independent study if the student is not graduating and if the faculty member is available. Great value to the scholar and the project outcome can result when <b>an</b> honors <b>contract</b> project is voluntarily extended and refined. This paper describes <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> one honors contract that expanded into a much larger project, benefitting two honors scholars in the growth of their content knowledge and skills sets in addition to producing a higher-quality product...|$|R
