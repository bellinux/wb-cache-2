25|$|The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking {{man in a}} {{burgundy}} {{blazer and}} salmon-pink shirt who is summoned {{by people who are}} stuck in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting with a woman who doesn't want that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E

500|$|Rare {{announced}} in mid-1998 that their follow-up to GoldenEye 007 would appear at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) as Nintendo's lead game. Using {{an updated version}} of the GoldenEye 007 engine, Perfect Dark was originally intended to be available by December 1999 and was heavily trailed in magazines, with Nintendo Official Magazine predicting that it would be [...] "the best shooting game this century". A working version of the game appeared at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1998; N64 Magazine described the preview as having [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> to detail that had everyone who saw [...] drooling". A more complete version of the game was presented at E3 in May 1999 and at Nintendo Spaceworld in August 1999, along with Rare's Donkey Kong 64 and Jet Force Gemini. Shortly before release, Rare unveiled a number of websites for companies in the game's universe, such as datadyne.com, to promote interest in the game's storyline. Nintendo also arranged a number of publicity stunts, including hiring model Michele Merkin, who appeared as Joanna Dark in commercials and in-store promotions for the game cartridge.|$|E
500|$|Releases {{from major}} studios – such as The Big Lebowski (1998), which was {{distributed}} by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail {{at the box}} office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. [...] Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. [...] With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. [...] The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as The Big Lebowski, can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. [...] Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial. [...] Discussing his reputation for making cult films, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said, [...] "I didn't set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits." [...] Writing in Cult Cinema, academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism is not out of character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else.|$|E

2500|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn, Cathy Davidson {{suggests}} that breakthroughs in cognitive science should recalibrate {{our sense of}} what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the [...] "digital age," [...] even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> than we previously required.|$|E
2500|$|Zichermann {{reports that}} he gravitated towards using game {{mechanics}} professionally with games like Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Civilization. In his speeches at TED he argues that not only can gamification be exploited by business but it also can be utilized in education as a serious game to teach students that are not otherwise engaged with traditional classrooms. He points to [...] educationalist Anant Pai's work with an elementary school in White Bear Lake, Minnesota as well as University of Washington's Foldit program. He counters {{the argument that the}} immersive environment of video games don't teach the right <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> by pointing to the concept of fluid intelligence. Zichermann believes the intense mental engagement of video games is tied to the dopamine released in game participants as the players receive rewards in game. [...] Zichermann also refutes the idea that gamification is necessarily pernicious or simply a fad by pointing to the positive results of gamification applied outside of the entertainment industry, although he has acknowledged that a dark side does exist to this technology. He also posits that gamification could be taken to online banking, charitable organizations, or any other industry. A system of rewards could encourage members of a gym to attend regularly.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began working}} {{in the studio with}} Naughty Boy in 2009, where the pair first worked {{together}} on Chipmunk's debut album I Am Chipmunk. When Sandé was 16 years of age, her parents took her to Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor Tour and she said she always wanted Keys to hear her music. She spoke on why she likes Keys so much; [...] "I'd read about her background and identified with her on so many levels. She was mixed race like me, a great student who'd been top of her class, who played piano and loved Nina Simone. And there she was in the pop charts, yet with songs that had a message. I saw 16,000 people hanging on her every word and thought, [...] "I want this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> I want Alicia to know my music." [...] The pair met when Sandé had just came back from New York and just began a second songwriting stint, but this time involved with Keys. The pair sat at a piano and played for hours {{trying to come up with}} a good track. She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the lyric, rather than there just be throwaway pop music. Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill were also major influences for the album.|$|E
40|$|A growing {{literature}} suggests that working memory and attention are closely related constructs. Both involve the selection of task-relevant information, and both are characterized by capacity limits. Furthermore, studies {{using a variety of}} methodological approaches have demonstrated convergent working memory and attention-related processing at the individual, neural and behavioral level. Given the varieties of both constructs, the specific <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and WM must be considered. We find that individuals’ working memory capacity (WMC) uniquely interacts with feature-based attention when combined with spatial attention in a cuing paradigm (Posner, 1980). Our findings suggest a positive correlation between WM and feature-based attention only within the spotlight <b>of</b> spatial <b>attention.</b> This finding lends support to the controlled <b>attention</b> view <b>of</b> working memory by demonstrating that integrated feature-based expectancies are uniquely correlated with individual performance on a working memory task...|$|R

2500|$|She also enlisted costume {{designer}} Arianne Phillips {{to create the}} dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made. In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she [...] "started doing research in 2009, a year before [...] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry {{to make her feel}} royal. My first task was figuring out how to re-create those famous gifts." [...] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project. The singer understood the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched the clothes on display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way We Wore had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives. Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinise the dresses. Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces. For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with organza skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method of {{predicting}} human egocentric visual attention using bottom-up visual saliency and egomotion information. Computational mod-els of visual saliency are often employed to predict human attention; however, its mechanism and effectiveness have not been fully explored in egocentric vision. The purpose of our framework is to compute attention maps from an egocentric video {{that can be used}} to infer a person’s visual attention. In addition to a stan-dard visual saliency model, two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> maps are computed based on a camera’s rotation velocity and direction of movement. These rotation-based and translation-based attention maps are aggregated with a bottom-up saliency map to enhance the accuracy with which the person’s gaze positions can be predicted. The efficiency of the proposed framework was examined in real environments by using a head-mounted gaze tracker, and we found that the egomotion-based attention maps contributed to accurately predicting human visual attention...|$|R
