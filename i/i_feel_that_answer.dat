40|$|Each of the {{articles}} in this issue demonstrates the usefulness of computers in the clinical practice of medicine. We must now ask if these tools can {{be removed from the}} hands of the pioneers and used by the average nephrologist. Although <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the <b>answer</b> to this question is yes, most readers will be skeptical. The promise of computer power has been held before us for 20 years, and tangible results have been rare. To understand what has changed, we must review the causes of previous failures...|$|R
60|$|I {{conclude}} with regret, because I have not said {{one half of}} [what I intended] to say; but I am sure you will deem my excuse sufficient, [when I] inform you that my head aches violently, and I am in other respects unwell. I must, however, again give you my warmest thanks for your kind letter. I shall be happy {{to hear from you}} again: and do not think it unreasonable that I should request a letter from you, when <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the <b>answer</b> which <b>I</b> may make to it will not perhaps be above three or four lines. This I mention to you with frankness, and you will not take it ill after what I have before said of my remissness in writing letters.|$|R

50|$|I {{have often}} been asked if I have found a {{definite}} type of Fighter pilot… I have thought about this a lot, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> the <b>answer</b> is ‘No’… The most striking thing about the Fighter pilots - ‘operational Fighter pilots’, grand title that, isn’t it? - is their ordinariness. Just ‘You, I, Us and Co.’, ordinary sons of ordinary parents from ordinary homes.So when you wonder where they come from, dear reader, whoever you may be, contemplate your own home, your profession and your background, {{and you have the}} answer. You have everything in common with them, or at least I hope you have, for they are just people who read the poster that reads ‘It all depends on YOU’. They are not a race apart.|$|R
6000|$|CUSINS [with polite obstinacy] Mr Undershaft: I am in {{many ways}} a weak, timid, ineffectual person; and my health is far from satisfactory.
