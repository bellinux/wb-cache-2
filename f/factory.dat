5|$|In 1796, a German {{engineer}} {{found that}} the area had suitable clay for the making of faience, and two years later, founded the Mezhyhirya Faience <b>Factory,</b> {{the first one in}} Ukraine, {{at the site of the}} unused monastery. By 1852, the faience <b>factory</b> had become the largest industrial complex in Kiev. During its existence, the <b>factory</b> produced a variety of crockery and ornamental vases and figurines. In 1884, the faience <b>factory</b> was closed down after it failed to bring any profit.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Malcolm Reid {{proposed}} the station's site {{as a possible}} location for a £80 million Siemens wind turbine <b>factory.</b> The <b>factory</b> would create 700 jobs and up to 1,500 further jobs in the supply chain if built. He has said the site would be perfect for the <b>factory</b> because of its close proximity to NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities. The <b>factory</b> {{is likely to be}} built either in Blyth or on Humberside.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{manufacturer}} Batchelors {{became a}} significant employer in Ashford when they opened a £2.5m <b>factory</b> in Willesborough, {{east of the}} town centre, in 1957. A substantial proportion of Batchelors staff moved from their main production unit in Sheffield to Ashford. The <b>factory</b> is now owned by Premier Foods. Proprietary Perfumes Ltd (PPL), a division of Unilever opened a fragrance and flavour <b>factory</b> and research laboratory {{next door to the}} Batchelors <b>factory</b> in 1962. It was subsequently renamed as Quest International and purchased by Givaudan in 2007.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the massive expansion of the Royal Ordnance <b>Factories</b> in the Arsenal, and of private munitions companies, other UK Government-owned National Explosives <b>Factories</b> and National Filling <b>Factories</b> were built during the First World War. All the National <b>Factories</b> closed {{at the end of}} the War, with only the Royal (munitions) <b>Factories</b> (at Woolwich, Enfield, and Waltham Abbey) remaining open through to the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} UK World War II {{explosives}} <b>factories</b> were built and owned by ICI. These privately owned explosives <b>factories</b> {{were not considered}} part of the ROF Organisation and they were not called ROFs. ICI also managed numerous munitions <b>factories</b> constructed with Ministry of Supply funding; these were known as Agency <b>Factories.</b> ICI Nobel's Ardeer site and its World War II agency <b>factories</b> produced, for example, 35% of the combined ROF and Agency <b>Factories</b> output of Cordite and 15% of the combined output of TNT.|$|R
5|$|An {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{was established in}} the town with the construction of an Airspeed <b>factory</b> at Christchurch Airfield in 1942. In 1948 the <b>factory</b> became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire, Sea Venom and Sea Vixen. In the 1950s, Bournemouth Airport, a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn, also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong—which later became the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)—established a <b>factory</b> at the airport.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new <b>factory</b> in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the <b>factory</b> should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new <b>factory</b> elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the grand Roman villa was being {{excavated}} at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate <b>Factory.</b> Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the <b>factory</b> grounds, and construction on the <b>factory</b> went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the <b>factory</b> a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the <b>factory</b> site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E

5|$|British Cellophane Ltd, a {{joint venture}} between La Cellophane SA and Courtaulds opened a major <b>factory</b> {{producing}} cellophane in Bridgwater 1937. The <b>factory</b> produced Bailey Bridges during World War II for the invasion of Europe. Bought by UCB Films in 1996, the town suffered a blow in 2005 when Innovia Films closed the cellophane <b>factory.</b> At one time the <b>factory</b> employed around 3,000 people, although at the time of closure this had been reduced to just 250. However recovery has begun with the establishment of new businesses on the Express Park business park including the relocation of Gerber Juice and new enterprises Toolstation and Interpet as well as the Exel centre for the NHS Logistics Authority.|$|E

5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste <b>factory,</b> responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the <b>factory</b> replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate <b>factory,</b> which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
50|$|In genetics, {{transcription}} <b>factories</b> {{describe the}} discrete sites where transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus. They were first discovered in 1993 and {{have been found to}} have structures analogous to replication <b>factories,</b> sites where replication also occurs in discrete sites. The <b>factories</b> contain an RNA polymerase (active or inactive) and the necessary transcription factors (activators and repressors) for transcription. Transcription <b>factories</b> containing RNA polymerase II are the most studied but <b>factories</b> can exist for RNA polymerase I and III; the nucleolus being seen as the prototype for transcription <b>factories.</b> It is possible to view them under both light and electron microscropy. The discovery of transcription <b>factories</b> has challenged the original view of how RNA polymerase interacts with the DNA polymer and it is thought that the presence of <b>factories</b> has important effects on gene regulation and nuclear structure.|$|R
50|$|Although {{damage to}} big <b>factories</b> was slight, {{approximately}} one-fourth of some 4,000 lesser <b>factories,</b> which operated hand-in-hand {{with the big}} <b>factories,</b> were completely destroyed by fire.... Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks, workers in general were reluctant {{to work in the}} <b>factories,</b> and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.|$|R
40|$|Economic historians tend {{to explain}} {{the rise of the}} {{cooperative}} form in agriculture from the advantage of cooperative over private <b>factories</b> in reducing transaction costs with suppliers. This study provides a first test of this thesis using data on 1, 130 dairy <b>factories</b> in The Netherlands. Indeed, we find that cooperative <b>factories</b> performed significantly better than private <b>factories.</b> The persistence of private <b>factories</b> in certain regions can be explained by first-mover advantages.

Charlie is {{determined}} to save the <b>factory</b> and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first <b>factory</b> in 1848, a larger <b>factory</b> called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the <b>factory,</b> mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by <b>Factory</b> No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to <b>Factory</b> No. 381 as <b>Factory</b> No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to <b>Factory</b> No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the <b>factory</b> had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E
