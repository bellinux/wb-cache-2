5000|$|Sir Joseph William Isherwood, 1st Baronet (23 June 1870 [...] - [...] 24 October 1937) was a British naval architect. He {{invented the}} <b>Isherwood</b> <b>System</b> of {{longitudinal}} construction of ships and the Arcform System.|$|E
50|$|In the 1900s Richardson, Duck started {{building}} steel hulls. By {{the end of}} that decade Richardson, Duck had built five hundred tramp steamers, other merchant ships and lighters. It had also become licensees for the <b>Isherwood</b> <b>system</b> of longitudinal framing.|$|E
50|$|Longitudinal framing (also {{called the}} <b>Isherwood</b> <b>system</b> after British naval {{architect}} Sir Joseph Isherwood, who patented it in 1906) {{is a method}} of ship construction in which large, widely spaced transverse frames are {{used in conjunction with}} light, closely spaced longitudinal members. This method, Isherwood felt, lent a ship much greater longitudinal strength than in ships built in the traditional method, where a series of transverse frames were fit together closely from the keel upwards.|$|E
5000|$|Isherwood {{was created}} a Baronet, of Raggleswood, in the 1921 Birthday Honours in {{recognition}} of his invention of the <b>Isherwood</b> <b>System.</b> The name of his baronetcy was taken from his country home, Raggleswood, in Chistlehurst, Kent. The Isherwood Armorial at Raggleswood is recorded as Argent, a fesse dancettee azure, between three rudders proper. Mantling azure and argent. Crest-On a wreath of the colours, a lymphoid sails furled sable, surmounted by a rainbow proper. Badge-Two daffodils, leaved and slipped proper, enfiled by a circlet or. Motto-"Perficio curium." ...|$|E
50|$|Isherwood {{was born}} in Hartlepool, {{the son of a}} grocer. He was educated at Luggs School on the Headland, near St Hilda's church, and at the age of fifteen entered the drawing office of the Hartlepool shipbuilders Edward Withy & Co. He served in several {{departments}} in that firm and in 1896 left to become a ship surveyor with Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Here he developed the <b>Isherwood</b> <b>System,</b> a new stronger, safer, and cheaper longitudinal girder form of ship construction designed to replace the traditional traverse construction method (ribs placed at regular intervals along the keel), which he patented in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|Longitudinal framing was a known {{method of}} {{shipbuilding}} before Isherwood. Naval engineer J. Scott Russell, for instance, had built several longitudinally framed ships, including the SS Great Eastern. However, {{no one had}} made the process practical from a commercial standpoint, which was Isherwood's achievement. The first commercial vessel constructed with the <b>Isherwood</b> <b>system,</b> the oil-tank steamer Paul Paix, of some 6,600 tons deadweight in 1908, was scrutinized by other shipbuilders and owners. The success {{of it and the}} first general cargo liner to be constructed on the [...] "Isherwood" [...] system, the Gascony in early 1909, encouraged builders in a number of countries to use longitudinal framing as well.|$|E
50|$|The ship's launch {{set a new}} world's {{record for}} rapid construction. The ship, and sister , were built on the {{patented}} <b>Isherwood</b> <b>System</b> of longitudinal framing with propulsion machinery in the stern. Cargo space was provided by six large, self trimming, coal holds for 2,248 ST of coal and four deep tanks forward under the lower deck combined with tanks in the inner bottom under the holds for 772,400 gal L of oil cargo. The coal holds had two hatches each, except for the one hatch for the forward hold, and the contract requirement was for each hatch being able to handle 100 ST per hour which was met in the official test by a figure of 137.5 ST per hour. An advantage of the Isherwood framing was a weight saving that allowed Orion to carry the specified deadweight on a draft of 26 ft instead of the contracted draft at that load of 27 ft allowing for an increase of 500 ST of coal at specified draft. Propulsion was by two triple expansion steam engines with cylinders of 27 in, 46 in and 76 in diameter and a 48 in stroke with steam from three double ended Scotch boilers driving two 16 ft three bladed propellers with 18 ft mean pitch with average trial speed of 14.468 kn achieved.|$|E
50|$|Structures {{involves}} {{selection of}} material of construction, structural analysis of global and local {{strength of the}} vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during motions in seaway. Depending {{on the type of}} ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure. The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship, deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible. The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships in the great eastern, it later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system. The arrangement of the <b>Isherwood</b> <b>system</b> consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them ass the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.|$|E
