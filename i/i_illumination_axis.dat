40|$|A new illumination-estimation {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{based on the}} dichromatic reflection model combined with Hough transform processing. Other researchers have shown that using the dichromatic reflection model under the assumption of neutral interface reflection, {{the color of the}} illuminating light can be estimated by intersecting the dichromatic planes created by two or more differently coloured regions. Our proposed method employs two Hough transforms in sequence in RGB space. The first Hough Transform creates a dichromatic plane histogram representing the number of pixels belonging to dichromatic planes created by differently coloured scene regions. The second Hough Transform creates an <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> histogram representing the total number of pixels satisfying the dichromatic model for each posited <b>illumination</b> <b>axis.</b> This method overcomes limitations of previous approaches that include requirements such as: that the number of distinct surfaces be known in advance, that the image be pre-segmented into regions of uniform colour, and that the image contain distinct specularities. Many of these methods rely on the assumption that there are sufficiently large, connected regions of a single, highly specular material in the scene. Comparing the performance of the proposed approach with previous non-training methods on a set of real images, the proposed method yields better results while requiring no prior knowledge of the image content...|$|R

It’s content can be captured by videoconferencing systems {{in order to create}} more engaging presentations to remote users. However depending on the lighting configuration in the scene and the position of the camera with respect to the whiteboard some shading effects and highlights may appear decreasing the contrast and legibility of the captured images. We propose a system that records and extracts the whiteboard content and enhances its appearance and legibility. Our system acquires a sequence of images from a high resolution fixed view camera and extracts the whiteboard content. Firstly we estimate the whiteboard background model using a robust surface fitting technique. We use this model to locally identify areas with written content and also to detect and remove occlusions. Secondly we estimate the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> that goes through the whiteboard color distribution in the RGB color space. Finally we implement two different enhancement methods: one that balances the image colors rotating the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> and another focused on enhancing the image colors using the estimated color of the illuminant. We perform a psycho-visual experiment on a dataset of images enhanced with our methods combined with other state of the art whiteboard image enhancement algorithms.

40|$|Color image {{segmentation}} algorithms often consider object color to be a constant property of an object. If the light source dominantly exhibits a particular color, however, it becomes necessary {{to consider the}} color variation induced by the colored illuminant. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} segmenting color images that are photographed under non-white illumination conditions. It also addresses how to estimate the color of illuminant in terms of the standard RGB color values rather than the spectrum of the illuminant. With respect to the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> that goes through the origin and the centroid of illuminant color clusters (prior given by the estimation process), the RGB color space is transformed into our new color coordinate system. Our new color scheme shares the intuitiveness of the HSI (HSL or HSV) space that comes from the conical (double-conical or cylindrical) structure of hue and saturation aligned with the intensity variation at its center. It has been developed by locating the ordinary RGB cube {{in such a way that}} the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> aligns with the vertical axis (Z-axis) of a larger Cartesian (XYZ) space. The work in this paper uses the dichromatic reflection model [1] to interpret the physics about light and optical effects in color images. The linearity proposed in the dichromatic reflection model is essential and is well preserved in the RGB color space. By proposing a straightforward color model transduction, we suggest dimensionality reduction and provide an efficient way to analyze color images of dielectric objects under non-white illumination conditions. The feasibility of the proposed color representation has been demonstrated by our experiment that is twofold: 1) Segmentation result from a multi-modal histogram-based thresholding technique and 2) Color constancy result from discounting illumination effect further by color balancing...|$|R

The range of incidence angle in which only the total reflection occurs at all three uncoated corner mirrors has been found to vary considerably with the orientation of CCR and the refractive index of the CCR prism. The analytical expression for the far-field diffraction pattern of a tilted CCR is obtained by taking different polarization transformation of the six sectors of the effective reflecting aperture into account. This expression is essential when evaluating the lidar {{cross section of}} a moving CCR which is tilted in general. Formulas for the angles defining the six sectors have also been obtained...|$|R

40|$|Camera sensors (CCD) have {{a limited}} dynamic range that {{constrains}} {{the brightness of the}} incident light that can be quantified. In other words, if the ray of incident light is too intense, the sensor saturates and the value quantified is inadequately represented. This color clipping effect is a common problem in computer vision and it can become specially difficult when dealing with specular objects against a low-intensity background. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing such clipping effects of CCD cameras appearing in color images. Using an averaging technique to estimate the color of the illuminant, we define two types of axes in the RGB color cube: the <b>Illumination</b> <b>Axis</b> and the Clipping Axis. Our study concludes the followings: 1) the clipped pixels from a dielectric object form one or two lines, depending on the number of color channels on which the clipping effect takes place; and 2) these lines are parallel to the Clipping Axes. These two properties allow for a framework for a color-based segmentation that works even in the presence of saturated (specular) regions in the image. Moreover, the captured images can now be obtained under a wider variation of illumination conditions...|$|R

40|$|Deriving {{intrinsic}} {{images from}} image sequences Intrinsic images are a useful midlevel description of scenes proposed by Barrow and Tenenbaum [1]. An image is decomposed into two images: a reflectance image and an illumination image. Finding such a decomposition remains a difficult problem in computer vision. Here {{we focus on}} a slightly easier problem: given a sequence of Ì images where the reflectance is constant and the illumination changes, can we recover <b>Ì</b> <b>illumination</b> images and a single reflectance image? We show that this problem is still illposed and suggest approaching it as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem. Following recent work on the statistics of natural images, we use a prior that assumes that illumination images will give rise to sparse filter outputs. We show that {{this leads to a}} simple, novel algorithm for recovering reflectance images. We illustrate the algorithm’s performance on real and synthetic image sequences. ...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{sections}} of the cornea are obtained by illumination with a collimated beam expanded in a fan shape by a small rotary cylindrical lens. The light diffused from the cornea is observed by two cameras and processed in order to yield the surfaces' profiles. The optical system used to project a thin rotating line on the cornea consists of a white light source provided with optical fiber bundle output which is first conditioned {{by a set of}} lenses so that it would produce a spot on the cornea. A small cylinder lens is used to expand the beam in one direction so that a thin line illuminates the cornea, rather than a spot. The cylinder lens is provided with motor driven rotation about an axis normal to its own in order to rotate the line on the cornea such that the projected line scans the whole cornea; the illuminator is completed with a slit aperture. The cornea is not perfectly transparent, scattering some of the light that traverses it; this fact is used for its observation by two cameras. These are placed at pre-defined angles with the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis,</b> so that optical {{sections of}} the cornea can be seen; the use of two cameras avoids the need for camera rotation in synchronism with the cylinder. The two cameras' images can be combined in order to simulate a single virtual rotating camera. Image processing is used to extract information about the corneal surfaces profiles and thickness from the optical sections. Several peculiar aspects of processing are discussed, namely the corneal edge detection algorithm, the correction for angle of view and deformation due to observation of the inner surface through the cornea.

40|$|Color is {{an image}} {{attribute}} {{that has been used}} extensively in many areas of computer vision such as image segmentation, object recognition, and object tracking. Color values, however, heavily depend on both the illumination intensity and the color of the illuminant. Variations in illumination intensity create shading effects on object surfaces that need to be discounted. Moreover, with non-white illumination, object surfaces exhibit illumination-induced color changes. It therefore becomes important to use color descriptors that are maximally independent of not only the variations of illumination intensity but also the color content of the illumination. Although the RGB color space {{is one of the most}} commonly used color representations, it does not provide illumination-invariance. Other color spaces such as the HSI and the normalized RGB provide simple but ineffective mechanisms to cope with variations of illumination. To the best of our knowledge, a color descriptor that is completely free from illumination effects has not yet been reported in the literature. ^ In this dissertation, we propose a transformation technique that adapts the color space to the color of the illuminant and leads to a color representation that is more independent of illumination than any existing approaches. This color space transformation extends the well-known RGB-to- HSI transformation to the case of non-white illumination in such a way that the saturation is measured as radial distance from the <b>illumination</b> <b>axis</b> and the hue as the polar angle around the same axis. When a color space is constructed in this manner, it becomes possible to characterize object color with illumination-adapted hue and illumination-adapted saturation. Another benefit of the new color space is that the dichromatic plane now acquires a single-parameter characterization. Our experimental results on color constancy, color image segmentation, specularity detection and color object tracking establish the usefulness of the new approach to color representation. ...|$|R

As a result, much effort is being placed on reducing the k 1 for hole patterning to the range of 0. 35 - 0. 40.

Selective excitation of photosystem I by far-red light for 130 min {{resulted in a}} 40 % inactivation of photosystem I. It is surprising that this treatment also caused up to 90 % damage to photosystem II. This suggests that active oxygen produced at the reducing side of photosystem I is highly damaging to photosystem II. Only a small pool of the D 1 -protein was degraded. However, most of the D 1 -protein was modified to a slightly higher molecular mass, indicative of a damage-induced conformational change.

40|$|Abstract—Visible light {{communications}} (VLC) {{has recently}} gained popularity {{as an alternative}} to RF. However, the design and deployment of a VLC system requires an understanding of the underlying communications and how they affect the design of higher layer protocols. In this paper, we take a basic step towards getting an understanding of the impact of interference on a VLC system. Such an understanding is key to the design of MAC protocols for arbitrating access across lights in multiple rooms, while ensuring that illumination requirements are met. Specifically, we consider the interference across two rooms from VLC emitters. The emitters are assumed to use Binary Pulse Position Modulation (BPPM); the pulse width is varied to provide different dimming levels. In this setting, we use a modified ray-tracing algorithm to calculate the channel impulse response between the emitters and receivers that are located at different positions within a room. Subsequently, we analyze the performance observed at the receivers in the presence of (<b>i)</b> <b>illumination</b> and (ii) transmissions from an interfering VLC emitter. We find that in the former case, the VLC emissions from the interferer do not impact the reception at the target receiver. However, in the latter case, the performance is degraded. The extent of degradation depends on the position of the receiver. We find that increasing the dimming level increases the pulse intensity and thus, improves performance in the presence of interference. We also perform extensive simulations to provide performance results in different settings. I...|$|R

On the minute time scale this leads to redirection of the excitation energy, usually referred to as state transitions, which involves movement of the phycobilisomes. We have studied short-term light adaptation in isolated heterocysts and intact filaments from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. In N. punctiforme vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts where nitrogen fixation takes place. Photosystem II is inactivated in the heterocysts, and the abundancy of Photosystem I is increased relative to the vegetative cells. To study light-induced changes in energy transfer to Photosystem I, pre-illumination was made to dark adapted isolated heterocysts. Illumination wavelengths were chosen to excite Photosystem I (708 nm) or phycobilisomes (560 nm) specifically. In heterocysts that were pre-illuminated at 708 nm, fluorescence from the phycobilisome terminal emitter was observed in the 77 K emission spectrum. However, illumination with 560 nm light caused quenching of the emission from the terminal emitter, with a simultaneous increase in the emission at 750 nm, indicating that the 560 nm pre-illumination caused trimerization of Photosystem I. Excitation spectra showed that 560 nm pre-illumination led {{to an increase in}} excitation transfer from the phycobilisomes to trimeric Photosystem <b>I.</b> <b>Illumination</b> at 708 nm did not lead to increased energy transfer from the phycobilisome to Photosystem I compared to dark adapted samples.
