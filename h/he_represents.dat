5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that <b>he</b> <b>represents.</b>|$|E
