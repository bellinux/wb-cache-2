25|$|To {{reach the}} quays, No.42 had first to pass over a short tramway from the BNCR goods yard to the Belfast Harbour Commissioners' tramway. To {{accomplish}} this feat required three persons {{to drive and}} conduct her, and if more than two wagons were attached, a fourth to look after them. Two of these people were equipped with red flags. While on the tramway her driver {{was not allowed to}} sound the whistle, open the cylinder <b>drain</b> <b>taps</b> or allow the engine to blow off. The maximum speed was to be three miles per hour.|$|R

60|$|These accesses of new {{population}} {{have come}} {{in a series of}} waves, very much as if successive reservoirs of surplus population in the Old World had been <b>tapped,</b> <b>drained</b> and exhausted. First came the Irish and Germans, then Central Europeans of various types, then Poland and Western Russia began to pour out their teeming peoples, and more particularly their Jews, Bohemia, the Slavonic states, Italy and Hungary followed and the latest arrivals include great numbers of Levantines, Armenians and other peoples from Asia Minor and the Balkan Peninsula. The Hungarian immigrants have still a birth-rate of forty-six per thousand, the highest birth-rate in the world.|$|R
40|$|Lakes {{within the}} Colville River delta in {{northern}} Alaska, USA, vary {{in size from}} small ponds created by ice-wedge growth to thaw lakes that are as much as three kilometres long and ten metres deep. As the river migrates, lake edges are breached and the lakes are <b>drained.</b> Such lake <b>tapping</b> is aided by permafrost thaw and ice wedge melt and, {{in the case of}} the larger lakes, by wave action within them. Once a lake is <b>tapped,</b> it <b>drains</b> rapidly creating a deep scour hole at its entrance and from then on it is subject to the varying stages and discharge of the river. During flooding, when the river is transporting its largest amount of sediment, the tapped lakes become settling basins and rapidly fill. The Colville River delta has lakes in all stages from freshly breached to those that are now being destroyed by channel migration...|$|R
50|$|Medicine Lake is a {{geologic}} anomaly in {{the sense}} that it is not actually a lake but rather an area in which the Maligne River (flowing from Maligne Lake into the Athabasca River) backs up and suddenly disappears underground. During the summer months during intensified meltwater runoff the lake (which during the winter months is a meandering frozen river) fills to levels which fluctuate over time and with the runoff events. Much like a bathtub that is filled too fast for it to drain, it becomes laden with water (lake) until it can slowly <b>drain</b> as the <b>tap</b> flow (runoff) is reduced (river). The underground system is extensive and during the 1970s researchers used a biodegradable dye to determine the underground river's extent. The dye showed up in many of the lakes and rivers in the area to the point where it became clear that the underground system was one of the most extensive in the world.|$|R
40|$|Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} (AK)  — corneal inflammation {{caused by}} protozoa — Acanthamoeba. The disease is related mainly with wearing of contact lens, pathogen — Acanthamoeba penetrates under the contact lenses. The cases of AK after Lasik are described. Corneal epithelium microtrauma and contact with sources of environmental pollution are {{the risk factors}} of the invasion of Acanthamoeba into the cornea. Acanthamoebas affect soil, stagnant reservoirs, swimming pools, <b>drain</b> pipes, <b>tap</b> water, etc. Diagnosis can be confirmed only when cysts are detected in cornea material, plate count, smear, and the containers where such material is stored. Long life cycle including cyst stage helps keratitis relapsing course last for months. It is not always possible to detect cysts. Assessment of etiology presents certain difficulties. Such aspects as history taking, monitoring the clinical course of disease, confocal microscopy that enables to reveal acanthamoebas in vivo help to determine a diagnosis. Disease {{is characterized by a}} long chronic course with the development descemetocele and cornea perforation. The sequence of remissions and exacerbations of inflammation, apparently, occurs due to peculiarities of Acanthamoeba life cycle. Acanthamoeba keratitis is difficult to treat, it’s resistant to antibiotics. Untimely diagnosed disease and delayed initiation of treatment in patients with AK promote corneal perforation and inflammatory process in deep eye structures what often leads to eye enucleation. Severe pain is typical for AK in onset of disease. It is caused by emergence of subepithelial infiltrates and defects along the nerve fibers located in the most sensitive surface layer of the cornea. Conservative treatment is conducted with the use of antiseptics. The most effective one against cysts is 0. 02 % chlorhexidine which is prepared ex. temporae. The article presents the peculiarities of clinical course of Acanthamoeba keratitis, clinical cases of the disease and the results of penetrating keratoplasty as the main method of treatment of severe AK. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to improve the safety and shelf life of cooked kembung fish (Rastrelliger sp), a {{traditional}} food called pindang fish. Fresh eviscerated fish was fisrt soaked in 2 % NaCl solution for 15 minutes, <b>drained,</b> washed with <b>tap</b> water and <b>drained</b> again. Sodium chloride at 12 % concentration (w/w) was distributed on the whole surface of the fish. Fish was then laid on a wooden basket inside a clay pot, steamed for 30 minutes, and then cooled. Combine method applied to the steamed fish (pindang) was soaking in a mixed culture of Lactobacillus plantarum kik and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in the ratio of 2 : 1 (v/v) containing 4 % Na-acetate for 2 hrs and after draining, the product was vacuum packed. The result showed that the combine method using mixed culture of lactic acid bacteria containing 4 % Na-acetate could reduce the growth of Staphylococcus aureus by 3 - 6 log units, decrease the TMA (Trimethylamine) content and maintain the organoleptic properties (texture, appearance and odor) of pindang fish during 6 days storage at room temperature. Control treatment without 4 % Na-acetate could only keep the pindang fish for 4 days. Vacuum and nonvacuum packaging did not show any significant difference...|$|R
40|$|The {{ablution}} ritual consumes {{large amount}} of water, especially in musollas and mosques, where the greywater is allowed to run free and drain away. As quoted in the Hadith, Prophet Muhammad reminded Muslims to avoid wastage, even when performing the cleansing ritual or ablution prior to prayer. The ritual, locally known as known as wudhu’, requires a Muslim to wash exposed body parts with clean water. In Malaysia, most ablution system consists simply of a row of water taps with a drainage trough to carry the greywater to main <b>drains.</b> As the <b>tap</b> is usually left running, much good water is wasted in the process. Considering the unnecessary wastage, a simple recycling system can be designed to collect, treat and reuse the ablution water within a close-loop system for non-potable water applications, such as toilet flushing, general washing, plants watering and flowerbed cultivation. This approach does not only introduce practical engineering solutions in promoting sustainable living, it is also in-line with the Islamic principles of using natural resources in a prudent manner. By referring the University’s own mosque, a {{study was conducted to}} develop and verify a conceptual model of the ablution water recycling system, named SmartWUDHU’, which fulfills the requirements of Islamic teachings yet viable from the engineering perspective. A simple ablution water output prediction model was next proposed to mor...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} oviposition {{preferences of}} Aedes aegpti to water from storm-water <b>drains</b> and seasoned <b>tap</b> water were evaluated in the laboratory. The sample was collected from concrete storm-water drains with stagnant clear {{water in a}} dengue-endemic site, Taman Samudera, Selangor. Ae. aegypti adults were given a blood meal and released into the caged. Gravid females were given a choice between drain water and seasoned tap water for egg deposition. In a no-choice test, {{there was no significant}} difference in the numbers of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults colonized from the drain water and seasoned tap water (p> 0. 05), indicating that Ae. aegypti oviposit their eggs on a substrate which is readily available. In a choice test, the number of eggs laid by Ae. aegypti in drain water (1630. 67 Â± 204. 26) was significantly more than that in seasoned tap water (221. 33 Â± 53. 18) (p 0. 05), indicating that water from the drain did not contain high organic content. Significant water conductivity (p< 0. 05) and the presence of bacteria could have contributed to the site selection for egg laying by Ae. aegypti. The drain water successfully supported the colonization of the immatures, with the emergence of 824. 33 Â± 13. 96 adult mosquitoes. The ratio of male and female mosquitoes was 1 : 1. This study concluded that the concrete drainage system with clear stagnant water provides a suitable medium for the colonization of dengue vector Ae. aegypti...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hand hygiene {{causes a}} {{significant}} reduction in the carriage of potential pathogen in the hand. Inadequate hand hygiene facilities is one of the factors affecting compliance with hand hygiene by health care workers. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the availability and accessibility of hand hand hygiene facilities and supplies of hand hygiene agents in the inpatient wards of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Methods and Materials: The study was conducted in a federal tertiary hospital in Nigeria. A modified survey checklist that assessed the condition of hand hygiene sink and other facilities was adapted and pretested. Direct observations of existing hand hygiene facilities in all the inpatient wards were carried out by one of the authors. Results: Of the 28 sinks, 22 (78. 6 %) were accessible but 13 (46. 4 %) had blocked <b>drain.</b> All the <b>taps</b> were hand operated with only 4 (14. 3 %) working. Majority of the sinks (67. 9 %) had no soap and no sink had antiseptic solution. Only 8 (28. 6 %) sinks had hand drying material which was a cloth towel. No sink had hand hygiene instructions displayed on or close to it. Conclusion: There is gross inadequacy of hand hygiene facilities in Ido-Ekiti, Nigeria. There is an urgent need for health managers to give priority to provision of hand hygiene facilities at all levels of health care delivery. Infection Control Unit should be established and strengthened in each facility for effective implementation of infection control policies. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2012; 11 (5. 000) : 571 - 576...|$|R
