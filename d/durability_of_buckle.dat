40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{possibilities}} <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> evaluation <b>of</b> surface layer of concrete structures. The <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete surface layer usually determines the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the structure as a unit. It has to be determined in what environment the structure is situated and what influences it has to face, to set the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the structure. There is a several normative prescription to set {{the resistance of the}} structure. There is formulated a summary of the most widely used and known prescriptions in the theoretical part of the thesis. It is a lot of effort to estimate the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the concrete by estimation of permeability of the concrete surface layer recently. Thus these methods are also formulated in the summary and there are compared the individual outputs of the tests. The permeability and pore structures of the concrete surface layer are crucial parameters for the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete structure. These parameters influence the construction properties of the concrete as well, thus the thesis {{is focused on}} relationship of the pore structure and the strength in press of the concrete...|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} of fines content, methylene blue (MB) value, and lithology of crushed sand (CS) on frost <b>durability</b> and strength <b>of</b> concrete were investigated, and the frost <b>durability</b> and strength <b>of</b> crushed sand concrete (CSC) and river sand concrete (RSC) were compared. The {{results show that}} inclusion of fines improves CSC compressive strength and reduces frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> C 30 CSC when fines content reaches 10 %, whereas it has little negative influence on frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> C 60 CSC. Increasing MB value does not negatively affect compressive strength of C 30 CSC but decreases compressive strength of C 60 CSC and frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> CSC, and the reduction is more pronounced when MB value exceeds 1. 0. Lithology has no prominent influence on frost durability and compressive strength of CSC within the lithologies (dolomite, limestone, granite, basalt, and quartz) studied. Though compressive strength of CSC is a little higher than RSC under equal water to cement ratio, frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> CSC is no better than RSC especially for C 30 CSC, and air-entraining agent is suggested for enhancing frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> C 30 CSC exposed to freezing environment...|$|R

Abstract: Assessment <b>of</b> {{the structure}} <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete bridge in service {{is crucial for}} determining whether their service performance is meeting the design requirements or not. In this paper we classify the whole structure of bridge into two levels, i. e. bridge structure and bridge components. A two-level-multi-index model for evaluating the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete bridges in service is established based on the dependent functions of various factors, in which the dependent functions are chosen {{in accordance with the}} difference of various factors affecting the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> components. In this model, the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the bridge is divided into five different fuzzy levels: intact, disrepaired, damaged, severely damaged, and dangerous. Finally, based on fuzzy mathematics theory, the <b>durability</b> level <b>of</b> a bridge in practice is evaluated by using the maximum subordination principle...|$|R
40|$|Plant breeders {{are much}} {{concerned}} about the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the resistance gene(s) that they are incorporating into the better performing backgrounds to tolerate biotic stresses. While resistance that is controlled by a single major gene (vertical resistance) is simple to achieve, the one controlled by poly genes (horizontal resistance) is not. There {{are a number of}} ways to make the non-durable resistance genes durable. Comprehensively, the exploitation of genes with known <b>durability,</b> the use <b>of</b> quantitative resistance and the use of gene deployment are suggested to be some of them that can lead to the better ways <b>of</b> achieving <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> resistance. There are also various approaches of deploying genes to achieve <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> resistance. Therefore, to realize <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> disease resistance genes in crop plants any one of the approaches that are dealt in this study can be used without compromising their economic feasibility...|$|R

Samples {{were obtained from}} six different sites with distinct lithologies that included 12 mudstones from two sites, 14 mudshales from two sites, 6 clayshale and 4 siltstones. Slake durability tests were continued to fifth cycle to study the effect of different cycles on <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> weak rocks such as shale. The highest value <b>of</b> slake <b>durability</b> was measure for siltshale and the lowest for clayshlae. The slake <b>durability</b> results <b>of</b> this study also indicate {{that there is no}} single parameters {{that can be used to}} predict the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> weak rocks. The results show that durability is closely related to the quantity of clay minerals. Therefore, it can be concluded that variation in durability within weak rocks is controlled predominantly by mineralogy. A decrease in the slake durability was associated with an increase in clay content. It seems that other geological parameter such as fabric and weathering also effected <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> weak rocks...|$|R

40|$|The AC {{impedance}} spectroscopy (ACIS) is an electrochemical {{technique used}} to characterize materials in various research fields owing to its non-destructive nature. The ACIS, accordingly, {{appears to have}} a potential as a non-destructive technique to investigate the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> cement paste. An understanding of the mechanism of frost action occurring within cement paste, a key binding component of concrete, is necessary to improve the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete with respect to freezing and thawing, particularly where the winter is severe. In addition, the research on the effectiveness of the wollastonite micro-fibres, a cost-effective naturally occurring calcium silicate, as a reinforcing material to improve the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> cement paste is demanded due to worldwide concerns of material shortages. Three primary objectives in this study are to further the understanding of the mechanism of frost action within cement paste subjected to freezing and thawing, to investigate the potential of the ACIS as a new technique to determine the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> cement paste with respect to freezing and thawing and to investigate the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the wollastonite micro-fibre reinforced cement paste to freezing and thawing.
