5|$|In {{the valley}} temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre {{extended}} the eastern annex, where he added {{two sets of}} alabaster columns, rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> temple to the high temple. There, Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple, notably adding to it a square antechamber with a single central pillar.|$|E

5|$|Many {{men were}} {{infected}} with malaria, and the regiment was periodically rotated away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> bottom {{to the western}} hills. Their first move back west was on the 16 May, when they moved to the brigade camp site near Talaat Ed Dumm, remaining there for the next thirteen days. On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, {{to the south of}} Bethlehem. On 14 June the regiment returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Kushana {{leaves for}} the Tolmekian capital with Nausicaä and five hostages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley,</b> but an agile Pejite {{interceptor}} shoots down Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausicaä, Kushana and other hostages crash-lands in the jungle, disturbing several Ohm, which Nausicaä soothes. She leaves {{to rescue the}} Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Roman remains in particular a villa and burial pits. Artefacts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{were sent to the}} British Museum. Other Roman artefacts from the lake are on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. There are historic parks and mansion houses, including Stanton Drew, Hunstrete, Stowey House, Chew Court, Chew Magna Manor House and Sutton Court. Almost all of the villages have churches dating back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|US395 {{traverses}} {{the entire}} length of the Owens Valley, entering the valley near the former site of the Owens Lake. The valley, named for one of explorer John C. Fremont's guides, was primarily home to Timbisha and Paiutes before European settlement. Formerly a fertile lake and valley, Owens Lake and the southern portion of the valley are now dry. Water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> is channeled for use by the City of Los Angeles, via the Los Angeles Aqueduct, in what is commonly called the California Water Wars.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the border town of Dryden, NY38 emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still undeveloped area. The highway gradually curves {{to the north}} toward the village of Dryden, where the route changes names to South Street upon {{entering the}} village limits. It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E

5|$|As Ponsonby {{tried to}} rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was {{attacked}} by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue. By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry. A countercharge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch–Belgian light dragoons and hussars under Major-General Ghigny on the left wing, and Dutch–Belgian carabiniers under Major-General Trip in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J. Arroyo-Cabrales noted substantial differences in coloration and measurements between highland populations (albiventer) and lowland populations (mexicanus) in Jalisco. On {{the basis of these}} differences, they recognized O.albiventer as a species separate from the lowland populations, which they classified under O.couesi. They confirmed that Eliot's molestus was based on a large example of O.abiventer, but left the status of the three forms Goldman had associated with albiventer—crinitus, aztecus, and regillus—open, noting that there was no convincing evidence that these represented the same species as O.albiventer. The identity and exact provenance of fulgens (supposed to be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> of Mexico), and consequently its relationship to O. albiventer, remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid {{complex is}} unusual as the outer {{sections}} of the mortuary temple are offset {{to the south of}} {{the eastern side of the}} complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Buner <b>Valley</b> lies on <b>the</b> Peshawar <b>valley</b> {{border of}} <b>the</b> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It {{is a small}} {{mountain}} valley, dotted with villages and divided into four sub-divisions. The Mora Hills and the Ilam range divide it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Swat <b>Valley,</b> <b>the</b> Sinawar range <b>from</b> Yusafzai, <b>the</b> Guru mountains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mardan <b>Valley,</b> and <b>the</b> Duma range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Puran <b>Valley.</b> During <b>the</b> 19th century the inhabitants rose twice against the British, but submitted in 1897.|$|R

5000|$|The name Siebengebirge emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> word Siedengebirge which {{indicated}} {{the presence of}} soap boilers ("Seifensieder"), who were banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> because boiling soap smelled so bad.|$|R
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. All of those who stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and tank fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came down off the mountain where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small covering force on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the only chance of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
25|$|San Jose lies {{close to}} the Pacific Ocean and close to San Francisco Bay (a small portion of its {{northern}} border touches the bay). Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area and, like the hub and spokes of a wheel, surrounding communities emanate outwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> This growth, in part, has shaped the greater Bay Area {{as it is today}} in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of suburbanization away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
