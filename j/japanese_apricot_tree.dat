40|$|Scabs {{caused by}} Venturia carpophila greatly reduce {{the quality of}} the fruits of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot</b> (Prunus mume) when the disease is not {{properly}} managed. The disease produces a superficial blemish that is unlikely to affect the overall yield of processed fruit, but reduce the value of fruit intended for the fresh market. Incidence rates of scab at sprayed and unsprayed orchards range from 0 % to 21. 5 % and from 30. 2 % to 100 %, respectively, in the major cultivation regions of Jeonnam Province during the growing season of 2009. The trends in disease progress were quite similar, regardless of regions, and cultivar Namgo was relatively less damaged by scab compared to cultivar Cheonmae among the tested <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot</b> cultivars. The fruits on branches 1. 5 m above the infected <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot</b> <b>trees</b> and the stem-end parts of the infected fruits were more severely damaged by scabs, possibly because of rain and run-off facilitate dissemination of conidia of V. carpophila and subsequent infection of the fruits or branches. The conidia of V. carpophila were dispersed from March 24 to April 26 in 2010, and more conidia were dispersed from 2 -year-old branches than 1 -year-old branches. Since the control efficacies were higher than 90 % after more than two applications of Trifloxystrobin WG at 10 -day-intervals from mid April, it is that effective fungicides be applied at least two times at 10 -day-intervals from the middle of April to manage scabs of <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot</b> in orchards...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of pistil abortion widely occurs in <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot,</b> and imperfect flowers with pistil abortion seriously decrease the yield in production. Although transcriptome analyses have been extensively {{studied in the}} past, a systematic study of differential gene expression has not been performed in <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot.</b> To investigate genes related to the pistil development of <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot,</b> high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina) was employed to survey gene expression profiles from perfect and imperfect <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot</b> flower buds. 3, 476, 249 and 3, 580, 677 tags were sequenced from two libraries constructed from perfect and imperfect flower buds of <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot,</b> respectively. There were 689 significant differentially-expressed genes between the two libraries. GO annotation revealed that highly ranked genes were those implicated in small molecule metabolism, cellular component organisation or biogenesis at the cellular level and fatty acid metabolism. According to the results, we assumed that late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA), Dicer-like 3 (DCL 3) Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 2 (XTH 2), Pectin lyase-like superfamily protein (PPME 1), Lipid transfer protein 3 (LTP 3), Fatty acid biosynthesis 1 (FAB 1) and Fatty acid desaturase 5 (FAD 5) might have relationships with the pistil abortion in <b>Japanese</b> <b>apricot.</b> The expression patterns of 36 differentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-time (RT) -PCR. This is the first report of the Illumina RNA-seq technique being used {{for the analysis of}} differentially-expressed gene profiles related to pistil abortion that both computationally and experimentally provides valuable information for the further functional characterisation of genes associated with pistil development in woody plants...|$|R

In terms of anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of <b>apricot</b> gum <b>tree</b> this extract used on skin wound healing in rats. Materials and Methods: 28 Wistar male rats {{were divided into}} four groups: group I, normal without surgery, group II, control group without treatment, group III, a wound treatment with Vaseline, and group I˅, wound care therapy <b>apricot</b> <b>tree</b> resin extract. In the treated and placebo groups after anesthesia applied induction circular wound area of 280 square millimeters behind rats, but treated groups continued treatment for 21 days. Daily treatment was done with hydro-alcoholic extract of <b>apricot</b> <b>tree</b> gum. Wound size is measured every day by analyzing digital images for 21 days and then rats killed and samples were fixed in formalin. Slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissue sections were studied qualitatively and quantitatively, to check regeneration of cells, the collagen fibers, angiogenesis, and distribution of inflammatory cells. Normal data analyzed using Tukey test and data with non-normal distribution were compared between groups by Mann-Whitney test. Results: Use of <b>apricot</b> <b>tree</b> resin, reduces the blood vessels from the second week onwards, reduction of inflammatory cells and increased collagen fibers and tissue epithelialization.
