500|$|During {{the making}} of HIM's 2007 album Venus Doom, Valo's alcohol abuse worsened {{to the point that}} he was {{vomiting}} and defecating blood. According to Valo, he neither slept nor ate for weeks. Things came to a head, when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process. Valo was able to recuperate, until he suffered a relapse during the album's mixing stage. He was eventually admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Following Valo's time in rehab, HIM released , which was the band's first album that Valo recorded entirely sober. Since then, Valo has relapsed, but has said that he tries to balance his drinking, stating [...] "I'm an on-and-off guy. If <b>I</b> <b>drink,</b> <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> properly for long stretches of time. And if I don't drink, I don't drink at all." ...|$|E

60|$|So I {{abandoned}} the Snark voyage and sought a cooler climate. The day I {{came out of}} hospital I took up drinking again {{as a matter of}} course. <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> wine at meals. <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> cocktails before meals. <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> Scotch highballs when anybody I chanced to be with was drinking them. I was so thoroughly the master of John Barleycorn I could take up with him or let go of him whenever I pleased, just as I had done all my life.|$|R

500|$|The word θέλημα (thelema) {{is rare in}} {{classical}} Greek, where it [...] "signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual", but it is frequent in the Septuagint. Early Christian writings occasionally use the word {{to refer to the}} human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil, but it usually refers to the will of God. [...] One well-known example is in the [...] "Lord's Prayer" [...] (...) , “Thy kingdom come. Thy will (Θελημα) be done, On earth as it is in heaven.” It is used later in the same gospel (...) , [...] "He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, [...] "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> it, Thy will be done." [...] In his 5th-century Sermon on , Augustine of Hippo gave a similar instruction: [...] "Love, and what thou wilt, do." [...] (Dilige et quod vis fac).|$|E

2500|$|And He took a cup {{and when}} He had given thanks He gave it to them saying [...] "Drink this, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the {{forgiveness}} of sins. I tell you, I shall not drink again of {{the fruit of the}} vine until <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> it new with you in My Father's kingdom." ...|$|E
60|$|And still, {{through all}} this period, I did not care in the {{slightest}} for John Barleycorn. <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> when others drank, and with them, as a social act. And I had so little {{choice in the matter}} that <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> whatever they drank. If they elected whisky, then whisky it was for me. If they drank root beer or sarsaparilla, <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> root beer or sarsaparilla with them. And when there were no friends in the house, why, <b>I</b> didn't <b>drink</b> anything. Whisky decanters were always in the room where I wrote, and for months and years I never knew what it was, when by myself, to take a drink.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{five months}} were {{spent in the}} various islands of the Hawaiian group. Being ashore, <b>I</b> <b>drank.</b> <b>I</b> even <b>drank</b> {{a bit more than}} I had been {{accustomed}} to drink in California prior to the voyage. The people in Hawaii seemed to drink a bit more, on the average, than the people in more temperate latitudes. I do not intend the pun, and can awkwardly revise the statement to [...] "latitudes more remote from the equator." [...] Yet Hawaii is only sub-tropical. The deeper I got into the tropics, the deeper <b>I</b> found men <b>drank,</b> the deeper <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> myself.|$|R

2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} in The Japan Times, Tsuchiya explained: [...] "It is cool being wild and broken-down, but drinking at nighttime {{is enough for}} me. I believe when you make rock music, {{it might not be}} cool if you behave not so cleverly. Actually, I've been rather earnest. When <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> a bit, I can get crazy, but not too much. The happiest thing for me is my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{conductor}} Erich Leinsdorf {{thought that}} her longevity, like Flagstad's, {{had something to}} do with her Scandinavian heritage, remarking that Wagner required [...] "thoughtful, patient and methodical people."

I was born with the right set of parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Cantor, the {{character}} of Hamlet exists exactly where these two worlds collide. [...] He is in one sense drawn towards the active side of heroism by his father's legacy ("He smote the sledded Polaks on the ice") {{and the need for}} revenge ("now could <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> hot blood. And do such bitter business as the day/ Would quake to look on"). Simultaneously though, he is pulled towards a religious existence ("for in that sleep of death what dreams may come") and in some sense sees his father's return as a ghost as justification for just such a belief.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series is}} written by Fintan Ryan, {{produced}} by Helen Gregory {{and directed by}} Martin Dennis. The series itself is made by production company World Productions. Mangan and Ashfield had previously worked together early in their careers, providing voices for an animated series of Watership Down. Ashfield claimed that on set, she [...] "struggled to keep a straight face most of the time." [...] She also said that her part made her more aware of her health. She {{said in an interview}} with The Times that she hoped the show would make, [...] "people think twice about binge drinking." [...] When asked if the role made her more , she said, [...] "I watch what <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> and I try to keep myself healthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Soilent Grün {{broke up}} in 1982, Bela and Farin decided to form another band. In {{the first two}} years (including Sahnie) they mostly played in clubs in their hometown, Berlin. Their first release was a {{contribution}} to the sampler 20 schäumende Stimmungshits (rough translation: [...] "20 foamy party hits"), featuring a strong alcohol theme (for example, the chorus of [...] "Vollmilch" [...] translates as [...] "you drink whiskey, he drinks beer, <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> milk"). In 1983 they won a rock contest in Berlin and with the prize money they recorded their debut EP Uns geht's prima... ("We're doing great..."). Finally CBS signed them, and they released their first LP Debil ("Moronic") in 1984 then their second Im Schatten der Ärzte ("In the shadow of Die Ärzte") a year later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{events of}} Jesus' last week occupy {{a third of}} the content of all four gospels. Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph and drives the money changers from the temple, holds a last supper, prays to be spared the coming agony (but concludes [...] "if this cup may not pass away from me, except <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> it, thy will be done"), and is betrayed. He is tried by the Jewish leaders (the Sanhedrin) and before Pontius Pilate, and Pilate washes his hands to {{indicate}} that he does not assume responsibility. Jesus is crucified as king of the Jews, mocked by all. On his death there is an earthquake, the veil of the Temple is rent, and saints rise from their tombs. Mary Magdalene and another Mary discover the empty tomb, guarded by an angel, and Jesus himself tells them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.|$|E

2500|$|Ozu {{once said}} of Noda: [...] "When a {{director}} {{works with a}} scriptwriter they must have some characteristics and habits in common; otherwise, they won't get along. My daily life—what time I get up, how much sake <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> and so on—is in almost complete agreement with that of [...] When I work with Noda, we collaborate even on short bits of dialogue. Although we never discuss {{the details of the}} sets or costumes, his mental image of these things is always in accord with mine; our ideas never criss cross or go awry. We even agree on whether a dialogue should end with wa or yo." [...] From Late Spring on, partly due to Noda's influence, all Ozu’s characters would be comfortably middle class and thus, unlike the characters in, for example, Record of a Tenement Gentleman or A Hen in the Wind, beyond immediate physical want and necessity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of a nazirite vow {{is part of}} the ambiguity of the Greek term [...] "Nazarene" [...] that appears in the New Testament; the sacrifice of a lamb and the offering of bread does suggest a relationship with Christian symbolism (then again, these are the two most frequent offerings prescribed in Leviticus, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn). While a saying in ( [...] and [...] ) attributed to Jesus makes it doubtful that he, reported to be [...] "a winebibber", was a nazirite during his ministry, the verse ends with the curious statement, [...] "But wisdom is justified of all her children". The advocation of the ritual consumption of wine as part of the Passover, the tevilah in Mark 14:22–25 indicated he kept this aspect of the nazirite vow when Jesus said, [...] "Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> it new in the kingdom of God." [...] The ritual with which Jesus commenced his ministry (recorded via Greek as [...] "Baptism") and his vow in [...] and [...] {{at the end of his}} ministry, do respectively reflect the final and initial steps (purification by immersion in water and abstaining from wine) inherent in a Nazirite vow. These passages may indicate that Jesus intended to identify himself as a Nazirite ("not drinking the fruit of vine") before his crucifixion.|$|E

"May I be permitted," [...] he asked, [...] "to {{propose a}} toast--or rather several toasts? <b>I</b> <b>drink</b> with you, sir," [...] he added, {{with a slight}} bow, [...] "to the {{extinction}} of an ancient enmity!

60|$|The {{result was}} that I was no longer reinvigorated by periods of open-air {{abstinence}} and healthy toil. <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> every day, and whenever opportunity offered <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> to excess; for I still laboured under the misconception that the secret of John Barleycorn lay in drinking to bestiality and unconsciousness. I became pretty thoroughly alcohol-soaked during this period. I practically lived in saloons; became a bar-room loafer, and worse.|$|R
60|$|Of course <b>I</b> <b>drank.</b> <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> with {{my guests}} and hosts. Also, <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> by myself. Doing the work of five men, I thought, {{entitled}} me to drink. Alcohol was good {{for a man who}} over-worked. I noted its effect on my small crew, when, breaking their backs and hearts at heaving up anchor in forty fathoms, they knocked off gasping and trembling at the end of half an hour and had new life put into them by stiff jolts of rum. They caught their breaths, wiped their mouths, and went to it again with a will. And when we careened the Snark and had to work in the water to our necks between shocks of fever, I noted how raw trade rum helped the work along.|$|R
