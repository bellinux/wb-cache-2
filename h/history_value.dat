Although sold to an external audience, they are produced according to an internal standard. Older Hmong women in the United States still create elaborate Hmong clothing for nieces, daughters and granddaughters. And though such clothing is an important source of cultural identity for the Hmong, it's questionable whether such traditional attire will continue to survive beyond the next generation. Many young women now pursuing an education don't have the time to commit to years of practice in becoming proficient in Hmong paj ntaub techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a novel {{approach}} to the characterization of structural damage in civil structures is presented. The proposed method is scalable, automated, and well suited to implementation within a low power, low cost wireless sensing network. Structural damage often results in subtle changes to structural stiffness and damping properties that are manifested by changes in the location of transfer function characteristic equation roots (poles) upon the complex plane. Using structural response time-history data collected from an instrumented structure, transfer function poles can be estimated using traditional system identification methods. Comparing the location of poles corresponding to the structure in an unknown structural state {{to those of the}} undamaged structure, damage can be accurately identified. Pattern classification methods that have been increasingly popular in recent years for damage detection are leveraged to quantify damage existence, location, and severity. To validate the proposed methodology, response data from the Z 24 Bridge is adopted as a test case. Utilization of forced vibration data corresponding to the bridge in various controlled damaged states allow the damage detection methods to be tested; in this study, they are shown to be capable of accurate and robust damage assessment in such a complex civil structure.

How the accomplishment of law protection toward the object of tour for the temple at Tulungagung, 3. what the problem faced in accomplishment of the law protection for the temple at Tulungagung and how to solve those problems. This resets uses sociologist judicial method. Data gathering techniques that are used are interview with respondent/sample from population of the temple of Tulungagung and observation directly the object of research at Tulungagung as the lace for gathering the primary of data. Then, analyzing the data using descriptive method. From two sample of the tem[le that ever lost, the eases of the theft it self were; a. There was noting protection for the temple as one of the object of tour, b. The institution of the tourism were not responsible toward the theft of part the temple, c.

40|$|Histories. (Under the {{direction}} of Thomas M. Conte.) Value prediction is a speculative technique to break true data dependencies by using history to predict values before they are computed. Previous research focused on exploiting two types of value locality (computation-based and context-based) in the local value history, which is the value sequence produced by the same instruction that is being predicted. Besides local value <b>history,</b> <b>value</b> locality also exists in global value history, which is the value sequence produced by all dynamic instructions according to their execution order. In this thesis, {{a new type of}} value locality, computational locality in global value history is studied. A prediction scheme, called gDiff, is designed to exploit one special and most common case of this computational model, the stride-based computation, in global value history. Experiments show that there exists very strong stride type of locality in global value sequences and ideally the gDiff predictor can achieve 73 % prediction accuracy for all value producing instructions without any hybrid scheme, much higher than local stride and local context prediction schemes. However, the ability to realistically exploit locality in global value history is greatly challenged b...|$|E
