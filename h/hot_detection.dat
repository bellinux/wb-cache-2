The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether sensory abnormalities are confined to the dystonic body segments or whether there is a wider involvement in patients with idiopathic dystonia. For this purpose, we recruited 20 patients, 8 had generalized, 5 had segmental dystonia with upper extremity involvement, and 7 had cervical dystonia. In total, there were 13 patients with upper extremity involvement. We used Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) at the back of the hand in all patients and at the shoulder in patients with cervical dystonia. The main finding on the hand QST was impaired cold detection threshold (CDT), dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA), and thermal sensory limen (TSL). The alterations were present on both hands, but more pronounced on the side more affected with dystonia. Patients with cervical dystonia showed a reduced CDT and <b>hot</b> <b>detection</b> threshold (HDT), enhanced TSL and DMA at the back of the hand, whereas the shoulder QST only revealed increased cold pain threshold and DMA. In summary, QST clearly shows distinct sensory abnormalities in patients with idiopathic dystonia, which may also manifest in body regions without evident dystonia. Further studies with larger groups of dystonia patients are needed to prove the consistency of these findings...|$|E

The group first met during a three day-long workshop held in Clermont Ferrand (France) between 28 and 30 May 2013. During each day, presentations were given reviewing {{the state of the}} art in terms of (a) volcano <b>hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> and parameterization, (b) operational satellite-based <b>hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> systems, (c) lava flow modelling and (d) response protocols during effusive crises. At the end of each pre- sentation set, the four groups retreated to discuss and report on requirements for a truly integrated and operational response that satisfactorily combines remote sensors, modellers and responders during an effusive crisis. The results of collating the final reports, and follow-up discussions that have been on-going since the workshop, are given here. We can reduce our discussions to four main findings. (1) <b>Hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> tools are operational and capable of providing effusive erup- tion onset notice within 15 min. (2) Spectral radiance metrics can also be provided with high degrees of confidence. However, if we are to achieve a truly global system, more local receiving stations need to be installed with <b>hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> and data processing modules running on-site and in real time. (3) Models are operational, but need real-time input of reliable time-averaged discharge rate data and regular updates of digital elevation models if they are to be effective; the latter can be provided by the radar/photogrammetry community. (4) Information needs to be provided in an agreed and standard format following an ensemble approach and using models that have been validated and recognized as trustworthy by the responding authorities. All of this requires a sophisticated and centralized data collection, distribution and reporting hub that is based on a philosophy of joint ownership and mutual trust.

40|$|Hot {{spotting}} is {{a problem}} in photovoltaic (PV) systems that reduces panel power performance and accelerates cell degradation. In present day systems, bypass diodes are used to mitigate hot spotting, but it does not prevent hot spotting or the damage it causes. This paper presents an active <b>hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> method to detect hot spotting within a series of PV cells, using ac parameter characterization. A PV cell is comprised of series and parallel resistances and parallel capacitance, which are affected by voltage bias, illumination, and temperature. Experimental results have shown that when a PV string is under a maximum power point tracking control, hot spotting in a single cell results in a capacitance increase and dc impedance increase. The capacitance change is detectable by measuring the ac impedance magnitude in the 10 - 70 kHz frequency range. An impedance value change due to hot spotting can be detected by monitoring one high-frequency measurement in the capacitive region and one low-frequency measurement in the dc impedance region. Alternatively, the dc impedance can also be calculated using dc operating point measurements. The proposed <b>hot</b> spot <b>detection</b> method can be integrated into a dc-dc power converter that operates at the panel or subpanel level. close 0...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} shown that a {{significant}} portion of the total energy consumption of many data centers is caused by the inefficient operation of their cooling systems. Without effective thermal monitoring with accurate location information, the cooling systems often use unnecessarily low temperature set points to overcool the entire room, resulting in excessive energy consumption. Sensor network technology has recently been adopted for data-center thermal monitoring because of its non-intrusive nature for the already complex data center facilities and robustness to instantaneous CPU or disk activities. However, existing solutions place sensors in a simplistic way without considering the thermal dynamics in data centers, resulting in unnecessarily degraded <b>hot</b> server <b>detection</b> probability. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of sensor placement for <b>hot</b> server <b>detection</b> in a data center as a constrained optimization problem. We then propose a novel placement scheme based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to take various factors, such as cooling systems and server layout, as inputs to analyze the thermal conditions of the data center. Based on the CFD analysis in various server overheating scenarios, we apply data fusion and advanced optimization techniques to find a near-optimal sensor placement solution, such that the probability of detecting hot servers is significantly improved. Our empirical results in a real server room demonstrate the detection performance of our placement solution. Extensive simulation results also show that the proposed solution outperforms a commonly used placement solution in terms of detection probability. I...|$|R

Unlike previous event detection algorithms which do not distinguish between global events and local events, we believe {{it is important that we}} make that distinction as certain events can only be meaningful if they are placed in specific context while other events may arouse the interests of general users. The main contribution of this paper is that we’ve customized <b>hot</b> events <b>detection</b> by employing local community detection mechanisms and established a very clear concept for global hot events and local hot events. We present in this paper a multi-layer event detection algorithm which constructs a four-stage event detection procedure that produces a relatively comprehensive description of events relevant to the unique makeup and different interest of microblog users. Both the global hot events and local hot events we gathered are represented by a key tweet which contains sufficient information to depict a complete event. As a result of our algorithm's ability to precisely describe events which outperforms existing event detection algorithms, it is now possible for people to better understand public sentiment towards hot issues on microblogs. Experiments have shown that our multi-layer <b>hot</b> event <b>detection</b> algorithm can produce promising results in mining the interests of different communities, generating relevant event clusters and presenting meaningful events to community users.
