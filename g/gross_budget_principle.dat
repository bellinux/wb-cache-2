40|$|Traditional <b>budgeting</b> <b>principles,</b> with {{strictly}} defined business goals, have been, since 1998, slowly {{growing into}} {{more sophisticated and}} organization-adjusted alternative budgeting concepts. One of those alternative concepts is the “Beyond budgeting” model with an implemented performance effects measuring process. In order for the model to be practicable, budget planning and control has to be reoriented to the “bottom up” planning and control approach. In today’s modern business surroundings one has to take both present and future opportunities and threats into consideration, by valorizing them in a budget which would allow a company to realize a whole pallet of advantages over the traditional <b>budgeting</b> <b>principles</b> which are presented later in the article. It is essential to {{emphasize the importance of}} successfully implementing the new <b>budgeting</b> <b>principles</b> within an organization. If the implementation has been lacking and done without a higher goal in mind, it is easily possible that the process has been implemented without coordination, planning and control framework within the organization itself. Further in the article we present an overview of managerial techniques and instruments within the “Beyond budgeting” model such as balanced scorecard, rolling forecast, dashboard, KPI and other supporting instruments. Lastly we define seven steps for implementing the “Beyond budgeting” model and offer a comparison of “Beyond budgeting” model against traditional <b>budgeting</b> <b>principles</b> which lists twelve reasons why “Beyond budgeting” is better suited to modern and market-oriented organizations. Each company faces those challenges in their own characteristic way but implementing new dynamic planning models will soon become essential for surviving in the market...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} principles of the beyond budgeting model are entirely separated from any budgeting approach. Research has shown that managers express their concern that budgets are indispensible in their nature. However, the beyond budgeting advocates stress that improving existing budget approaches is not sufficient. Companies should rather abandon budgets and operate according to the beyond <b>budget</b> <b>principles.</b> This contrast between the views triggered the authors of this thesis to investigate whether the beyond budgeting model is a management control system that operates entirely free of any budgets. The investigation is finished with a case study on Svenska Handelsbanken, which is seen as the role model for beyond budgeting. It is investigated whether this particular corporation manages to operate free of budgets. The researchers have developed a conceptual framework, in order to compare the beyond <b>budgeting</b> <b>principles</b> with the most commonly used budgeting approaches. The investigation reveals that the principles are predominantly different from any budgeting approach. However, capital investments, resource allocation, and the control functions overlap partly with budgeting, even though the scope of the beyond budgeting model exceeds all the other approaches. The study further discloses that Svenska Handelsbanken allocates resources on the regional level in a very traditional budgeting way. Furthermore, staff and cash flow planning are also within the traditional budgeting approaches. Overall, the results suggest that the principles have to be updated to break free from budgeting and really go ‘beyond’. The so-called ‘better budgeting’ seems to be a hybrid between traditional and beyond budgeting. This hybrid cannot be replaced {{at this stage of the}} beyond budgeting model. ...|$|R
