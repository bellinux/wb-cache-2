40|$|The <b>hanger</b> reflex is {{a strong}} force {{illusion}} that was previously known {{to occur in the}} human head. We applied the <b>hanger</b> reflex to the wrist and had expected that “sweet spots ” would exist for the <b>hanger</b> reflex at the wrist, similar to the properties of the <b>hanger</b> reflex at the head. By measuring the pressure distribution and the rotation angle when the <b>hanger</b> reflex device was attached to the wrist, we found “sweet spots ” that efficiently generate the <b>hanger</b> reflex at the wrist. Based on the pressure distribution obtained, we developed a device to control <b>hanger</b> reflex generation at the wrist. This device reproduces the pressure distribution by pressing on the <b>hanger</b> reflex “sweet spots” using four linear actuators, and thus generates the <b>hanger</b> reflex at the wrist. The results of user testing indicated that the device can produce rotational forces efficiently. Author Keywords Pseudo-force; <b>hanger</b> reflex; pressure distribution; haptic display...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The <b>Hanger</b> Reflex is a {{phenomenon}} in which the head rotates involuntary when it is fastened with the wire <b>hanger.</b> This phenomenon is also found on the wrist. The <b>Hanger</b> Reflex is expected to produce smaller and more accurate haptic guide, because the device is fasten by end-effectors itself to user and {{does not require the}} fixing part. However, conventional device using the <b>Hanger</b> Reflex can only control the direction of the rotation, and fine control of the virtual force was not realized. To establish high efficient haptic device using <b>hanger</b> reflex, the control of the strength of the virtual force is required. In this paper, we used vibrators attached to <b>Hanger</b> Reflex device and describe the effect of the vibrator on the <b>Hanger</b> Reflex phenomenon on the wrist. The result of the experiment showed that the user feel enhanced virtual force when the vibration is presented under the <b>Hanger</b> Reflex. I...|$|R

25|$|In the hangline approach, wood items being {{finished}} are hung by carriers or <b>hangers</b> {{that are}} attached to a conveyor system that moves the items overhead or above the floor space.

The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air at the ceiling level to speed up drying process.|$|E

However, to use it as an interface, pain sensation induced by the <b>hanger</b> becomes a practical problem. In this paper, we determined the necessary conditions of the <b>Hanger</b> Reflex, and we developed an interface that can induce head rotation by using the <b>Hanger</b> Reflex, without giving pain to the user.

Pending to receive them, the siege engineers remained looking for the weakest points of Mahdia's defenses. It was García Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Marquis of Villafranca, who had the idea of bombing the walls from the sea, forming a gun battery on two galleys previously deforested and united to each other with <b>hangers</b> and planks. Nine pieces of artillery were settled on the platform, which was protected by shields and parapet, prior to anchor the galleys off the walls.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} cables must be anchored at {{each end}} of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called <b>hangers.</b> In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or may use a truss bridge to make this connection. In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.|$|E

5000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{increase}} the safety of bridges with pin and <b>hanger</b> assemblies by adding some form of redundancy to the assembly.

Another redundancy is connecting the cantilevered and suspended girders at the pin and <b>hanger</b> assembly with welded blocks and tie rods.
