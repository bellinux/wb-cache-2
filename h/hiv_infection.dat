40|$|The Demographic and Health Surveys from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Malawi {{reveal that}} a {{significant}} proportion of <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in adolescent women occurred in women who claim to be virgin.

This paper uses a nonparametric model to estimate the proportion of <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> associated with sexual activity under different assumptions on data accuracy. It shows that there is an inverse relation between data accuracy and importance of sexual HIV transmission. If all adolescent women in the considered sub-sample correctly report sexual activity, 70 % of <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> cannot be attributed to sexual HIV transmission.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) causes approximately 2. 5 million new infections every year, and nearly 1. 6 million patients succumb to HIV each year. Several factors, including cross-species transmission and error-prone replication {{have resulted in}} extraordinary genetic diversity of HIV groups. One of these groups, known as group M (main) contains nine subtypes (A-D, F-H and J-K) and causes ~ 95 % of all <b>HIV</b> <b>infections.</b> Most reported data on susceptibility and resistance to anti-HIV therapies are from subtype B <b>HIV</b> <b>infections,</b> which are prevalent in developed countries but account for only ~ 12 % of all global <b>HIV</b> <b>infections,</b> whereas non-B subtype <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> that account for ~ 88 % of all <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> are prevalent primarily in low and middle-income countries.

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status.

40|$|BACKGROUNDHistorical {{estimates}} have attributed 5 % to 10 % of new {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>infections</b> in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to unsafe blood transfusions. Although frequently cited, the validity of this statistic is uncertain or outdated. Recent estimates suggest blood transfusion's contribution to new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in the region may be much lower. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSWe searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature for quantitative estimates of the specific contribution of unsafe blood transfusion to the proportion of new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> occurring in SSA. The sources and methods used to generate attribution estimates were evaluated against published country-specific HIV prevalence data. RESULTSDespite multiple secondary citations, a primary published source attributing 5 % to 10 % of new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> to blood transfusions in SSA could not be established for the current era. The United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) modes of transmission (MOT) reports representing 15 countries suggest that between 0 and 1. 1 % of new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> per year (median, 0. 2 % or approx. two out of 1000 new infections each year) may be attributable to blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONRecent modeled estimates suggest that blood transfusions account for a very low proportion of new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in SSA, likely {{an order of magnitude}} lower than 5 % to 10 %. Direct quantification of risk is challenging given the paucity of data on the variables that impact transfusion-associated HIV. Specifically, data on HIV incidence in blood donors, blood bank laboratory test performance, and posttransfusion surveillance are lacking. Findings suggest an urgent need for improved surveillance and modeling of transfusion-associated HIV transmission in the region...|$|R
