5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>binding.</b> As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000 a {{consortium}} led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended {{to relocate to}} Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business. After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently {{the appointment of a}} three-man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium mk, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but were forced to officially renounce this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, however these plans have major negative repercussions for the future of Kingsmeadow and Kingstonian F.C..|$|E

2500|$|The border {{war ended}} in 2000 with {{the signing of}} the Algiers Agreement. Amongst the terms of the {{agreement}} was the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, known as the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE); with over 4,000 UN peacekeepers. The UN established a temporary security zone consisting of a 25-kilometre demilitarized buffer zone within Eritrea, running {{along the length of the}} disputed border between the two states and patrolled by UN troops. Ethiopia was to withdraw to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998. The Algiers agreement called for a final demarcation of the disputed border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia by the assignment of an independent, UN-associated body known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries and issue a <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> ruling. The peace agreement would be completed with the implementation of the Border Commission's ruling, which would also end the task of the peacekeeping mission. After extensive study, the Commission issued a final border ruling in April 2002, which awarded some territory to each side, but Badme (the flash point of the conflict) was awarded to Eritrea. The Commission's decision was rejected by Ethiopia. The border question remains in dispute, with Ethiopia refusing to withdraw its military from positions in the disputed areas, including Badme, while a [...] "difficult" [...] peace remains in place.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{finding and}} the given mechanism of charge and electron transfer in polypeptides are here integrated in a bifunctional model involving electronic charge transfer coupled to special internal rotations. Present molecular dynamics simulations that describe these motions {{in the chain}} result in the mean first passage times for the hopping process of an individual step. This “rest and fire” mechanism is formulated in detail—i. e., individual amino acids are weakly coupled and must first undergo alignment to reach the special strong coupling. This bifunctional model contains the essential features demanded by our prior experiments. The molecular dynamics results yield a mean first passage time distribution peaked at about 140 fs, {{in close agreement with}} our direct femtosecond measurements. In logic gate language this is a strongly conducting ON state resulting from small firing energies, the system otherwise being a quiescent OFF state. The observed time scale of about 200 fs provides confirmation of our simulations of transport, a model of extreme transduction efficiency. It explains the high efficiency of charge transport observed in polypeptides. We contend that the moderate speed of weak coupling is required in our model by the bifunctionality of peptides. This bifunctional mechanism agrees with our data and contains valuable features for a general model of long-range conductivity, <b>final</b> reactivity, <b>and</b> <b>binding</b> at a long distance...|$|R
