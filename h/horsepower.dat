5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 <b>horsepower</b> (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 <b>horsepower</b> (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 <b>horsepower</b> (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 <b>horsepower</b> (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 <b>horsepower</b> (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 <b>horsepower</b> (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|Similar to C {{with minor}} design changes. Passed 50-hour civil test in December 1935 {{generating}} a constant 955 <b>horsepower</b> (712kW) {{and a maximum}} rating of 1,045 <b>horsepower</b> (779kW). Failed military 100-hour test in March 1936. Powered the Supermarine Spitfire prototype.|$|E
5|$|That November, Parry {{released}} a tender for North Atlantic monthly mail service to Halifax beginning in April 1839 using steamships with 300 <b>horsepower.</b> The Great Western Steamship Company, which had opened its pioneer Bristol–New York service earlier that year, bid £45,000 for a monthly Bristol–Halifax–New York service using three ships of 450 <b>horsepower.</b> While British American, the other pioneer transatlantic steamship company, did not submit a tender, the St. George Steam Packet Company, owner of Sirius, bid £45,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax service and £65,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax–New York service. The Admiralty rejected both tenders because neither bid offered to begin services early enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydraulic}} launch motor {{is capable}} of producing 20,800 peak <b>horsepower</b> (15.5 MW). Because of the high speed and open nature of the trains, the ride will not operate in light rain.|$|E
5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features are removed and the aluminium body panels {{are replaced by}} carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, Lexus {{announced}} that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle: the two-door LC 500. The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 <b>horsepower.</b> The LC 500h, a V6 hybrid variant, could potentially become available in late 2017 or early 2018.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft <b>horsepower</b> per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 <b>horsepower</b> per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|More {{powerful}} DB9 {{released in}} 2015. Base price at $202,775. 540 <b>horsepower</b> at 6,750 rpm.457 lb-ft of torque at 5500 rpm.The 0 to 60mph/100kph time is 4.4 seconds.0 to 100mph in 10.2 seconds. Standing quarter in 12.8 to 12.9 seconds. Top speed 183mph.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 1907, J.B. Gibson {{introduced}} {{the first car}} in Yorkton. It was a 20 <b>horsepower</b> Reo. Within {{the space of a}} few months, several other cars appeared on the streets of Yorkton, and the pattern spread to other towns along the line.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{were the}} side-loading paddle steamers Gordon, Duncan and Hutton, named after General Gordon of Khartoum, Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton. Each was {{powered by a}} {{condensing}} engine manufactured by John Peen & Son of Greenwich producing 100 nominal <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{large dam}} across the Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million <b>horsepower</b> (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ <b>horsepower</b> engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|In July 1888, Brown and Peck {{negotiated}} a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 {{in cash and}} stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC <b>horsepower</b> produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($ in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} a 128-horsepower (95kW) White 160AX 386cubic inch (6,300cc) 6-cylinder {{gasoline}} engine. It had a compression ratio of 6.3:1 and a 60US gallon (230l) fuel tank. It could reach {{a top speed of}} 41.7mph (67.1km/h) and a range of 175miles (282km) and a power to weight ratio of 15.8 <b>horsepower</b> per tonne. It had a main armament of four 0.5in (12.7mm) machine guns in a M45 Quadmount and 12millimeters of armor on the front and the sides.|$|E
5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Claire B. Follette when it was built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York. In 1928, the ship was rebuilt by Brown Drydock on Staten Island and acquired the name Elmer S. Dailey. Brown Drydock installed two Fairbanks-Morse in-line six-cylinder diesel engines and added the pilothouse and stack. At an unspecified later date, one engine was removed and a direct-drive engine, rated at 180 or 210 <b>horsepower,</b> operated on compressed air. In its final configuration, the vessel was manned by a three-man crew.|$|E
5|$|The German Type IXA {{submarine}} was a sub-class of the German Type IX submarine {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1937 and 1938. These U-boats were designed between 1935 and 1936 and {{were intended to}} be fairly large ocean-going submarines. The inspiration for the Type IXA submarine came from the German Type IA submarine, which had a similar diving depth and identical submerged <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Roberts won the AMA Rookie of the Year Award. In {{his first}} {{professional}} race {{as an expert}} class rider in 1972, Roberts rode to victory at the Grand National short-track race in the Houston Astrodome. Roberts {{made a name for}} himself that year by battling the dominant Harley-Davidson factory dirt track team aboard an underpowered Yamaha XS 650 motorcycle, making up for his lack of <b>horsepower</b> with sheer determination. He finished the season ranked fourth in the country. In 1973, in just his second season as an expert, Roberts won the national championship, amassing a record 2,014 points in the 25-race series.|$|E
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the <b>horsepower</b> of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on the production line. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all {{the lakes}} in Jackson Hole, but {{motorized}} boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum <b>horsepower</b> limit on Jackson Lake (though there is a noise restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted {{on any of the}} park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, {{he applied}} to the Civil Aeronautics Administration for a {{commercial}} pilot's licence. He was subsequently certified to fly both single and multi-engine aircraft between 225 and 1500 <b>horsepower.</b> Before being discharged from the Army Air Force in July 1945, he began to fly for Pan American World Airways. He was based first in Miami, before moving to New York City for their long-haul flights. He began to fly routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. He and his wife Eileen lived in River Edge, New Jersey. He continued to pursue his dream of writing, and had a poem published in the Op-Ed section of the New York Times on June 17, 1943. During his time with the airline, he took two extension courses at Columbia University {{in the spring of}} 1946.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because {{that was all that}} would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way that}} aircraft require <b>horsepower.</b> Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake <b>horsepower</b> compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft <b>horsepower</b> (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by <b>horsepower</b> to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} <b>horsepower</b> deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more <b>horsepower.</b> Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost <b>horsepower</b> in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the United States and Japan were well matched in {{aircraft}} carriers, in terms of numbers and quality. Both sides had nine, but the Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier fighter plane was superior in terms of range and maneuverability to its American counterpart, the F4F Wildcat. By reverse engineering a captured Zero, the American engineers identified its weaknesses, such as inadequate protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks, and built the Hellcat as a superior weapon system. In late 1943 the Grumman F6F Hellcats entered combat. Powered by the same 2,000 <b>horsepower</b> Pratt and Whitney 18-cylinder radial engine as used by the F4U Corsair already in service with the Marine Corps and the UK's allied Fleet Air Arm, the F6Fs were faster (at 400mph) than the Zeros, quicker to climb (at 3,000 feet per minute), more nimble at high altitudes, better at diving, had more armor, more firepower (6 machine guns fired 120 bullets per second) than the Zero's two machine guns and pair of 20mm autocannon, carried more ammunition, and used a gunsight designed for deflection shooting at an angle. Although the Hellcat was heavier and had a shorter range than the Zero, on the whole it proved a far superior weapon. Japan's carrier and pilot losses at Midway crippled its offensive capability, but America's overwhelming offensive capability came from shipyards that increasingly out produced Japan's, from the refineries that produced high-octane gasoline, and from the training fields that produced much better trained pilots. In 1942 Japan commissioned 6 new carriers but lost 6; in 1943 it commissioned 3 and lost 1. The turning point came in 1944 when it added 8 and lost 13. At war's end Japan had 5 carriers tied up in port; all have been damaged, all lacked fuel and all lacked warplanes. Meanwhile, the US launched 13 small carriers in 1942 and one large one; and in 1943 added 15 large and 50 escort carriers, and more came in 1944 and 1945. The new American carriers were much better designed, with far more antiaircraft guns, and powerful radar.|$|E
25|$|Both the 350 and 455 V8s {{were carried}} over from 1971 with <b>horsepower</b> ratings {{switched}} the new SAE net figures {{based on an}} engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross <b>horsepower</b> method of past years based upon a dynamometer rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net <b>horsepower</b> compared to 230 gross <b>horsepower</b> in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net <b>horsepower</b> in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The Executive was {{equipped}} with two 285 <b>horsepower</b> Jacobs seven cylinder L-5 radial engines. However, the performance figures quoted by the Bennett group were based upon anticipated performance of the aircraft using Jacobs 300 <b>horsepower</b> L-6 engines. Sales information provided also mentions anticipated use of the Wright R-760-E Whirlwind of 350 <b>horsepower.</b> There is no record of installation of either of the larger engine choices.|$|E
25|$|Both {{base and}} Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the {{standard}} 350 two-barrel V8 increased in <b>horsepower</b> from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 <b>horsepower</b> and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with <b>horsepower</b> upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 <b>horsepower,</b> which also required premium fuel.|$|E
25|$|Unveiled in 2012 New York International Auto Show, this is {{an upgrade}} to the 2012 Shelby GT500 and {{available}} in two versions. The Street Legal version produces 920 <b>horsepower,</b> while the Track S/C delivers 1100 <b>horsepower.</b> The chassis has been strengthened to handle the additional power.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{power for}} Etna was a 30 <b>horsepower</b> gasoline engine.|$|E
25|$|They {{exhibited}} two coupled horizontal {{steam engines}} at the exhibition {{each of which}} delivered 80 <b>horsepower.</b>|$|E
25|$|Below are {{specifications}} as per {{the model}} year and displacement, with output shown as <b>horsepower</b> (kilowatts).|$|E
25|$|Under the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 <b>horsepower</b> with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 <b>horsepower</b> offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based Wildcat coupe.|$|E
