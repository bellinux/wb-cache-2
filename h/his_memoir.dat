5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> that {{the passion of}} his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view.

5|$|Both {{men were}} incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon {{began work on}} <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), which he {{dictated}} to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice. Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its message of violent antisemitism, became {{the foundation of the}} political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.|$|E

5|$|After {{his service}} as governor, Wilkinson {{returned}} to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, while {{staying in}} Paris, he was {{reminded}} of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, {{when he returned to}} Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> A Moveable Feast. By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas, the {{youngest}} child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, {{who grew up in}} the Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter was Jewish, and wrote in <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Passion for Truth, that his father's family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole's father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole's brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.|$|E
5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in <b>his</b> <b>memoir,</b> Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

5|$|When The Tower of Babble was {{released}} in April 2012, a little over {{one and a half}} years had elapsed since its author Richard Stursberg left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in August 2010. Stursberg had been recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch, as his vice-president in charge of English services. Stursberg had previously worked in the media business, most recently as the director of Telefilm Canada (2001–2004). He entered CBC in October 2004, to replace the retiring Harold Redekopp, with the idea of changing the network's direction, away from its focus on high arts and towards popular content. Though Rabinovitch supported him, Stursberg understood how difficult that transition would be and that he would face resistance and criticism. Stursberg's vision was not supported by Rabinovitch's successor, Hubert Lacroix, who eventually replaced Stursberg with Kirstine Stewart. The 63-year-old Stursberg left CBC in August 2010 and by October 2011 publisher Douglas & McIntyre acquired the world rights to <b>his</b> <b>memoir.</b> Douglas & McIntyre's parent company, D Publishers, filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, still owing Stursberg $13,000.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's life {{continues}} to fascinate, {{and he has}} been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published <b>his</b> <b>memoir</b> Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.|$|E
