The structure factor data show that the first sharp diffraction peak position of SiO 2 glass in helium medium remains essentially the same under pressures up to 18. 6  GPa, suggesting that helium may have entered in the voids in SiO 2 glass under pressure.

The VGT was downselected from two different designs. The VGT has robust operation, and easily met all the Orion requirements, especially size and weight. The VGT has a novel design with the gas trap made of a five-layer spiral wrap of porous hydrophobic hollow fibers that form a cylindrically shaped curtain terminated by a dome-shaped distal plug. Circulating coolant flows {{into the center of}} the cylindrical curtain and flows between the hollow fibers, around the distal plug, and exits the VGT outlet.

40|$|On Earth, sea ice {{is rich in}} brine, salt, and <b>gas</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{that form}} through {{capturing}} of seawater during ice formation. Cooling of the ice over time leads to sequential freezing of captured sea-water, precipitation of salts, exsolution of gases, and formation of brine channels and pockets. Distribution and composition of brines in sea ice depend on the rate of ice formation, vertical temperature gradient, {{and the age of}} the ice. With aging, the abundance of brine pockets decreases through downward migration. De- spite low temperatures and elevated salinities, brines in sea ice provide a habitat for photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms. On Europa, brine pockets and channels could exist in the icy shell that may be from a few km to a few tens of km thick and is probably underlain by a water ocean. If the icy shell is relatively thick, convection could develop, affecting the temperature pattern in the ice. To predict the distribution and chemistry of brine pockets in the icy shell we have combined numerical models of the temperature distribution within a convecting shell, a model for oceanic chemistry, and a model for freezing of Europan oceanic water.

40|$|During the Phanerozoic, Earth has {{experienced}} a number of transient global warming events associated with major carbon cycle perturbations. Paradoxically, many of these extreme greenhouse episodes are preceded or followed by cold climate, perhaps even glacial conditions, as inferred from the occurrence of glendonites in high latitudes. Glendonites are pseudomorphs of ikaite (CaCO 3 · 6 H 2 O), a hydrated carbonate mineral increasingly stable at low temperatures. Here, we show that methane seepage and oxidation provide an overriding control on Mesozoic glendonite formation (i. e., ikaite fossilization). Geochemical and petrological analyses of 33 Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous glendonites from five sections in Siberia (Russia) reveal that most of their infilling carbonate phases are reminiscent of methane-derived authigenic carbonates. Bulk glendonites and surrounding sediments exhibit exceptionally high and low carbon isotope values (+ 20 ‰ to – 45 ‰ VPDB [Vienna Peedee belemnite]), typical for carbon sources linked to methane generation and oxidation. <b>Gas</b> <b>inclusion</b> data confirm the presence of methane and longer-chain hydrocarbon gases, suggesting a thermogenic source for the methane.

40|$|About 35 years ago, Professor TAN Tjong-Kie {{proposed}} {{the hypothesis of}} rock “locked in” stresses and considered the “locked in” stresses were the failure cause of rock engineering projects. In recent years, Professor WANG Sijing and Professor QIAN Qihu have made some qualitative discussions on the hypothesis. However, this hypothesis has received very little attention and quantitative investigation. In this paper, the author puts forward and attempts {{to show that the}} tiny gas (or liquid) inclusions in contact rocks are a specific, concrete and measurable inclusion type of variable and considerable “locked in” stresses and kinetic energy. The pressure and volumetric expansion energy of a <b>gas</b> <b>inclusion</b> are a type of “locked in” (or sealed) stresses and internal deformation energy of actual existence and active power. The author gives the governing equations to calculate the pressure and volumetric expansion energy of gas inclusions, which is shown with calculation examples. The pressure of the gas inclusions is equivalent to the average value of the in-situ stresses in deep rocks. The gas inclusions, sealed in micro-defects or voids of deep rocks, are the common tensile or expanding volumetric force sources for the occurrences of many failures in the surrounding rocks of excavated or engineered caverns or tunnels in deep rock ground. Because of differences in the physical and mechanical properties of the surrounding rocks, the compressed and dense gas inclusions can cause the following three results and/or phenomena. They are (a) stable walls, (b) brittle fractures and (c) large deformation of the surrounding rocks. Hard and brittle intact rocks can have brittle fractures in the forms of rock burst, mine earthquake, rock split, and zonal disintegration. Soft and ductile intact rocks can have the deformation failure in the forms large deformation, creep and pressure bump accordingly. In addition, the gas inclusions with high pressure can be the source of abnormally high in-situ stresses in some special deep rock grounds...|$|E

A planet’s history is a long chronology of events with possibly a sequence of apocalyptic events in which asteroids, comets and their meteorite offspring play an important role. Large meteorite impacts on the young Earth could have contributed to the conditions for life to appear, and similarly large meteorite impacts could also create the conditions to erase life or drastically decrease biodiversity {{on the surface of the}} planet. Meteorites also contain valuable information to understand the {{evolution of}} a planet through their <b>gas</b> <b>inclusion,</b> their composition, and their cosmogenic isotopes. This paper addresses the evolution of the terrestrial bodies of our Solar System, in particular through all phenomena related to meteorites and what we can learn from them. This includes our present understanding of planet formation, their interior, their atmosphere, and the effects and relations of meteorites with respect to these reservoirs. It brings further insight into the origin and sustainability of life on planets, including Earth. Particular attention is devoted to Earth and Mars, as well as to planets and satellites possessing an atmosphere (Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan) or a subsurface ocean (e. g., Europa), because those are the best candidates for hosting life. Though the conditions on the planets Earth, Mars, and Venus were probably similar soon after their formation, their histories have diverged about 4 billion years ago. The search for traces of life on early Earth serves as a case study to refine techniques/environments allowing the detection of potential habitats and possible life on other planets. A strong emphasis is placed on impact processes, an obvious shaper of planetary evolution, and on meteorites that document early Solar System evolution and witness the geological processes taking place on other planetary bodies. ► Definition of habitability related to geophysical reservoirs and planetary evolution. ► Influence of sun and impacts on atmospheres evolution and planets habitats. ► Preservation and sustainability is important for life and biosignature preservation...|$|E

The rocks contained significant amounts of Fe 2 O 3, FeO, P 2 O 5, and nitrate (3 to 16 ppm).

Enrichment assays resulted in successful growth of thermophilic and alkaliphilic bacteria from the fluids, and some of these bacteria reduced Fe(III) to magnetite. 16 S rRNA gene analyses indicated that the rocks were dominated by sequences similar to sequences of Proteobacteria and that most organisms were related to nitrate reducers from a saline, alkaline, cold habitat; however, some phylotypes were either members of a novel lineage or closely related to uncultured clones. The bacterial {{communities in}} the fluids were more diverse and included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, gram-positive bacteria, Planctomycetes, and Candidatus taxa.
