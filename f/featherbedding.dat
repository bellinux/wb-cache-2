25|$|As {{the city}} {{attempted}} {{to mediate the}} dispute, Hunkin-Conkey officials accused the union of <b>featherbedding.</b> The city proposed that since flipping a light switch was not a professional skill, that the late-night worker should only be barred from completing work begun during the day. This solution proved acceptable to the union, and workers returned to the site on August 5.|$|E
25|$|Ball fought ferociously for the company's {{right to}} engage in its own {{contract}} negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industry-wide settlement that would traditionally contain <b>featherbedding</b> and wasteful work rules. This led to a prolonged work stoppage by non-operating unions beginning January 23, 1963, and whose picket lines were honored by the operating unions (the train crews).|$|E

25|$|In Spring 1964, Johnson did {{not look}} optimistically upon the {{prospect}} of being elected president in his own right. A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of <b>featherbedding.</b> Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} chapter in Ball's business career was his {{battle against the}} railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In {{order to try to}} save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with physical deterioration and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company's right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement that Ball thought would include <b>featherbedding</b> and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry's struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to improve its economic efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Hutcheson was a vocal {{opponent}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom he denounced as a [...] "dictator" [...] while campaigning for his opponent, Alf Landon, in 1936. Hutcheson's conservative politics and his {{conflict with the}} CIO may have played some part in the government's decision in 1940 to charge Hutcheson and other union leaders for criminal violations of the Sherman Act in 1940. The government claimed that the union's traditional methods of protecting its members' work — jurisdictional strikes, resistance to work-displacing technology, and <b>featherbedding</b> — were illegal restraints of trade. The United States Supreme Court upheld the district court's dismissal of the indictment in the first prosecution brought {{by the government in}} United States v. Hutcheson, , ending any further prosecutions of the Carpenters.|$|E
50|$|Labor economists often {{argue that}} <b>featherbedding</b> {{is the most}} {{economically}} optimal position from both an employer's and employee's perspective. <b>Featherbedding</b> only emerges under certain circumstances. Chief among these is that the employer has an exploitable surplus (e.g., profit) to support the practice. <b>Featherbedding</b> also arises where market forces fail and organizations are permitted to be noncompetitive. Under this analysis, corporations (for example) are already inefficient and <b>featherbedding</b> does not make them more or less so. <b>Featherbedding</b> can, in some circumstances, take excess resources (profits) away from the employer and give them to workers {{in the form of}} more income per worker or higher numbers of employees at the same income level. <b>Featherbedding</b> is considered economically efficient because it occurs in the give-and-take of collective bargaining. If employers were relatively strong vis-a-vis unions, unions would be unable to impose <b>featherbedding</b> on them. As the politico-socio-economic strength of each party changes over time, collective bargaining outcomes will as well, enlarging or reducing the number and impact of <b>featherbedding</b> rules on the employer.|$|E
50|$|Feathers for a <b>featherbed</b> {{could be}} saved from geese or ducks being {{prepared}} for cooking. In England servant-girls were often allowed to keep feathers from poultry they'd plucked, and could save {{them to make a}} <b>featherbed</b> or pillows for their future married life. Live birds might have their soft downy breast feathers harvested {{three or four times a}} year, as described in an account from 20th century Missouri. Some poultry feathers were undesirable for mattress-making, especially chicken feathers. The best <b>featherbeds</b> were filled with a high proportion of down; larger feathers needed to have their quills clipped.|$|R

Another hybrid was the [...] "Tribsa" [...] which had a Triumph engine in a BSA frame. Other combinations such as the [...] "Norvin" [...] (a Vincent V-Twin engine in a <b>Featherbed</b> frame) and racing frames by Rickman or Seeley were also adopted for road use.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Featherbedding</b> is the {{practice}} of hiring more workers than are needed to perform a given job, or to adopt work procedures which appear pointless, complex and time-consuming merely to employ additional workers. The term [...] "make-work" [...] is sometimes used as a synonym for <b>featherbedding.</b>|$|E
50|$|More recent {{political}} {{analyses of}} <b>featherbedding</b> {{have concluded that}} <b>featherbedding</b> is not necessarily economically optimal, but is better than other forms of bargaining. Under this analysis, the best form of collective bargaining would be {{one in which the}} union and employer bargain not only over wages but the level of employment. Most unions in the United States, for example, bargain solely over wages. Bargaining over work rules (<b>featherbedding)</b> as well as wages achieves outcomes close to those reached by bargaining solely over wages, but is better than bargaining over wages alone.|$|E
50|$|In post-war Japan, <b>featherbedding</b> is uncommon. A post-war {{consensus}} emerged among {{labor unions}} that <b>featherbedding</b> {{was not in}} the best interest of workers, and unions in Japan have tended to avoid the practice.

5000|$|In nations where {{trade union}} {{activities}} are legally defined, legal definitions of <b>featherbedding</b> exist. These definitions are few in number, {{and tend to}} be narrowly drawn.

However, in 1953, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Act's definition only applies to payments for workers not to work. Therefore, work rules requiring minimum crew sizes, the assignment of duties to craft workers, and other [...] "make-work" [...] agreements do not constitute <b>featherbedding.</b>|$|E
