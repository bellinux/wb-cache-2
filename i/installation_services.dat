2500|$|Fog: The entire KY 9 {{corridor}} is {{plagued by}} fog, usually more than 60 days a year. A public education campaign may help. Visibility sensors and weather stations {{along the highway}} may help increase notification in these fog events. Highway Advisory Radio messages may also {{prove to be a}} benefit. Another major alternative would be the [...] "automated lane indication system," [...] which is similar to airport technology. Lighting installed in the pavement outlining the lane edges is [...] "activated automatically when heavy fog conditions are sensed. By having the lanes outlined, the lights greatly increase visibility conditions in times of heavy fog, thus creating safer operating conditions. Additionally, these lights are recessed into the pavement so as not to hinder snow removal operations. Since they are used at virtually every commercial airport in the United States, the lights are readily available and qualified <b>installation</b> <b>services</b> are easily attainable. This type of system has been used successfully in many locations, including Interstate 64 near Charlottesville, Virginia." [...] Rest areas, to keep vehicles and trucks off the road during fog times, may provide a [...] "safe haven".|$|E
