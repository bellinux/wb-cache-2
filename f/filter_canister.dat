25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> connected with a hose by a <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> screwed {{on the side of}} the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|E
50|$|The M40 was {{the result}} of a program in the 1980s to develop a {{successor}} to the M17-series protective masks which had been in service with the US armed forces since 1959. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted <b>filter</b> <b>canister,</b> rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The final prototype, the XM40, was approved for service and then designated the M40.|$|E

Air is delivered to the wearer when he breathes in, or in other words, reduces the pressure in the mask to less than outside pressure, hence the name [...] "negative pressure". The limitations of this are obvious, as any leaks in the device or the interface between the mask and the face of the wearer (caused for example by small face skin wrinkles) would reduce the protection offered.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the mask with its {{internal}} cheek filters means {{that it must be}} removed by the wearer to change the filters once they are expired or clogged, thus compromising its protective capabilities in a contaminated environment. The US armed forces henceforth returned to 'traditional' designs of mask where <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> are mounted externally and thus can be changed if needed without the wearer having to remove the mask.|$|R
50|$|The M40 field {{protective}} mask features three voicemitters, one {{on either the}} right or left side, and one in front. A voicecom adapter may be placed over the front voicemitter to amplify the user's voice. The mask can be adjusted {{in the field to}} accept the <b>filtering</b> <b>canister</b> on either side, so that a weapon may be shouldered. Right-handed shooters will normally locate the canister {{on the left side of}} the mask and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary disc valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|E
50|$|The S6 {{respirator}} provided {{protection to}} the face, eyes, lung and throat of the wearer against all known chemical agents of that time. The filter of the respirator did not filter out carbon dioxide. The S6 features an innovative air seal around {{the inside of}} the face piece to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the air seal, in different climatic conditions. The wearers natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the air seal, thus getting a better seal around the face. The mask could also be made to benefit left-handed people, where the <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> is positioned on the right of the face mask instead of the left. The location of the filter on the left or right side of the mask was to allow the rifle to be shouldered, aimed and fired correctly.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} a unique {{straight}} twin, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil-injected, dual rotary disc valve. The engine's ignition air supply began in an air <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> below the seat and was pulled through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head then downward into the two internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors. The A1 had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and inline with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the disc cover. The rotary disc valve was housed inboard of that cover. The A1 Samurai motor was lubricated by the Superlube system, with 2-stroke oil directly injected in the intake tract.Previously equipped with points, the ignition system was equipped in 1969 with a Capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system then increased the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.|$|E

A moderate current {{provided by a}} power <b>filter</b> or <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> is appreciated. The water should be slightly alkaline (pH about 7.6) within a temperature range of 24° to 29 °C. Although the fish is generally a mid-water dweller, a fine gravel or sand substrate should be provided since it will occasionally burrow.|$|R
40|$|The current {{environmental}} control device in the shuttle uses lithium hydroxide (LiOH) <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{from the cabin}} air, requiring several bulky <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> {{that can only be}} used once and must be changed frequently. To alleviate a stowage problem and decrease launch weight, the Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) at the NASA Johnson Space Center has been researching a system to be used on future shuttle missions. This system uses two beds of solid amine material to absorb CO 2 and water, later desorbing them to space vacuum. In this way the air scrubbing medium is regenerable and reusable. To identify the efficacy of this regenerable CO 2 removal system (RCRS), CTSD began investigations in the shuttle mockup. The purpose of this investigation was to support the CTSD program by determining mean levels of carbon dioxide and water vapor production in normal, healthy males and females age-matched with the astronaut corps. Subjects' responses were measured at rest and during exercise at intensity levels equivalent to normal shuttle operation activities. The results were used to assess the adjustments made to RCRS and are reported as a reference for future investigations in shuttle {{environmental control}}...|$|R

25|$|Gas mask {{development}} {{since has}} mirrored {{the development of}} chemical agents in warfare, filling {{the need to protect}} against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as blister agent or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.|$|R

A total of 88 air samples were taken by the validated methods to measure concentrations of TEA and DEA emitted from gas mask canisters during simulated use in an environmental chamber. Samples were collected on a mannequin equipped with a breather pump and also on human volunteers.

40|$|As a {{participant}} in the three-nation partnership for development of the ANBCP-S for use in Helicopters, Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet, the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF) picked up the challenge to design a Filter- Blower-Unit (FBU). Major Command (MajCom) of the RNLAF set priority to develop a system for Helicopter use first. After that the same system is to be used in Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet. The FBU is supposed to provide clean air for breathing, body and head cooling and demist of the vision system. Because of special knowledge required to set specifications for this FBU, the RNLAF contracted a Dutch Research Institute, TNO. TNO has the capability to do all research and testing to set all requirements. The RNLAF asked TNO to quantify the amount of air needed for breathing, body and head cooling and demist of the vision system. Some of the basic requirements set by MajCom are: - The system must be Man mounted, - Battery powered; - Filtersytem must be based on the NATO canister system; - It has to operate continues, without major changes, for a period of eight hours. Several trails were performed to quantify the acquired amount of air in terms of oxygen consumption, ventilation and corresponding cooling rates. During those trails it became clear {{there is a big difference}} in consumption between a Pilot and a Loadmaster. Therefore our primary goal is to develop a system which is suitable for the most difficult crewmember to equip. To the opinion of TNO and RNLAF that is the Loadmaster. TNO performed trails in house and on location. On location they used the equipment of Soesterberg (SSB) Airforce Base (AFB) (The Netherlands) and flightsimulators in Marseille (France) (AS 532 U 2) en Benson (United Kingdom) (CH 47 D).

25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that <b>canister</b> <b>filters</b> are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|R

40|$|The {{deposition}} {{hole was}} {{closed on the}} 1 st February 2005 signifying {{the start of the}} hydration phase. Groundwater inflow through a number of conductive discrete fractures resulted in elevated porewater pressures leading to the formation of conductive channels (piping), the extrusion of bentonite from the hole and the discharge of groundwater to the gallery floor. This problem was addressed by drilling two pressure-relief holes in the surrounding rock mass. Artificial hydration began on the 18 th May 2005 after 106 days of testing. Initial attempts to raise porewater pressure in the artificial hydration arrays often resulted in the formation of preferential pathways. These pressure dependent features were not focused in one location but occurred at multiple sites at different times in the test history. These pathways appear to be relatively short lived, closing when water pressure is reduced. It was determined that both pressure relief holes should remain open until the bentonite had generated sufficient swelling pressure to withstand the high water pressure in the system when these holes are closed. Packers were installed into the pressure relief holes on 23 rd March 2006 and sections in them closed off over the period to 5 th July 2006.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{dust collector}} {{tests showed that}} 99. 6 % of the test dust fed into the collector was captured by the dustbags. Figure 1 shows {{the condition of the}} main chamber before and after testing. Total weight gain on the <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> was over five times greater without use of the bag. The RAM-I unit showed respirable dust levels in the collector exhaust to be over two times higher when tests were conducted without the bags in place. The APS showed that the" number of total dust particles emitted from the exhaust was two times greater when the tests were conducted without the bags. Since nearly all the dust is contained in the bag, operator exposure is improved when emptying the collector box's main chamber. Filter loading is greatly decreased when using the bags, enabling longer periods of drilling without filter removal/cleaning. Pressure drop across the filter for all tests ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 3 in w. g. when the bag was used and from 4. 0 to 8. 4 in w. g. without the bag. Filtered air emitted from the collector has less respirable dust and fewer total dust particles when the bags are used. These results show that benefits from use of the bags are realized in all areas of operator exposure. In order to use these bags in underground coal mines, the dustbags must be accepted by MSHA as an optional item for the specific dust collection system and machine model (30 CFR 33). In addition, the collector must be equipped with a predump option and must have a retrofit kit installed inside the collector to connect to the bag..
