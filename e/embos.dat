50|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the <b>EMBOs</b> on the planet will be at the lowest level of technology, which is fire. As the game progresses, new {{technologies}} are discovered, ranging from pottery to medicine to aviation. New technologies help the <b>EMBOs</b> to become more widespread on the planet, which means a larger population for the afterlife when they die. The development of new technologies can be assisted by wielding influence on an EMBO artist or inventor {{in the same way that}} <b>EMBOs</b> are persuaded to new tenets or sins and virtues.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>EMBOS</b> OS {{was written}} entirely from scratch in a {{slightly}} extended Pascal. It was a multi-server architecture (like GNU Hurd, but long predating that project). The UI was Unix-like, especially at the shell level, with similar concepts but different commands, syntax, etc. (e.g. [...] "files" [...] instead of [...] "ls"; [...] "find" [...] instead of [...] "grep"). Later, a Unix kernel was hosted {{on top of the}} lower-level servers so that <b>EMBOS</b> and Unix processes and users could co-exist (ENIX). VMS compatibility software running on top of <b>EMBOS</b> was also added to ease porting of VAX applications.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{thinking}} in academic and policy making circles puts forward {{the idea that}} ethnic minority businesses need to escape from their disadvantageous sectoral concentration through diversification into higher value-added activities. Drawing on the US experience, {{it has been suggested}} that intermediation initiatives that promote the concept of supplier diversity hold a great promise. Such initiatives are concerned with developing and bringing together corporate procurement officials (CPO) of large organisations and ethnic minority business owner-managers (<b>EMBOs),</b> so that the two parties can engage meaningfully. Yet, in the UK such initiatives are still at an early stage of development and there is little detailed evidence of their modus operandi or effectiveness. Hence, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how nurturing and facilitating the interaction of communities of practice of CPOs and <b>EMBOs</b> can help their professional development and their approaches to procuring and supplying respectively. Situated learning theory is used to this effect, contributing to the debate around its usefulness and on the constructability and performative advantages of communities of practice. The paper reports on the researchers’ experience with two projects relating to intermediation initiatives that brought together and developed CPOs of large organisations and <b>EMBOs.</b> The lessons drawn would be useful for intermediary organisations, large procurers and minority suppliers who are willing to engage with the concept of supplier diversity...|$|E

40|$|This paper fills an {{important}} {{gap in the}} human resource development (HRD) literature by considering the role that NGO intermediation initiatives can play in bringing together and developing corporate procurement officials (CPOs) and ethnic minority business owner-managers (<b>EMBOs)</b> supplying goods and services. It {{has been suggested that}} such initiatives hold great promise in helping ethnic minority businesses escape from their disadvantageous sectoral concentration in the UK. Using situated learning theory as an application lens, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate how nurturing communities of practice of CPOs and <b>EMBOs</b> and facilitating their interaction can help their professional development and their approaches to procuring and supplying, respectively. The paper reports on the authors' experience with an action research programme encompassing two intermediation initiatives of this kind. The lessons drawn from this study are useful for all those concerned with HRD for inclusive procurement; intermediaries promoting inclusive procurement, large procurers who are willing to engage with supplier diversity and ethnic minority suppliers who wish to access corporate procurement systems and 'break-out'...|$|E
