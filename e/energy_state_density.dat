40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{mechanism}} of dissolved oxygen content on the surface corrosion behavior of Fe-based heat transfer, the first principle is used {{to study the}} adsorption of O 2 monomolecular, H 2 O monolayer and dissolved oxygen system on Fe-based heat transfer surface. The GGA/PBE approximation {{is used to calculate}} the adsorption <b>energy,</b> <b>state</b> <b>density</b> and population change during the adsorption process. Calculations prove that when the dissolved oxygen is adsorbed on the Fe-based surface, the water molecule tends to adsorb at the top sites, and the oxygen molecule tends to adsorb at Griffiths. When the H 2 O molecule adsorbs and interacts on the Fe (001) surface, the charge distribution of the interfacial double electric layer changes to cause the Fe atoms to lose electrons, resulting in the change of the surface potential. When the O 2 molecule adsorbs on the Fe (001) crystal surfaces, the electrons on the Fe (001) surface are lost and the surface potential increases. O 2 molecule and the surface of the Fe atoms are prone to electron transfer, in which O atom's 2 p orbit for the adsorption of O 2 molecule on Fe (001) crystal surface play a major role. With the increase of the proportion of O 2 molecule in the dissolved oxygen water, the absolute value of the adsorption energy increases, and the interaction of the Fe-based heat transfer surface is stronger. This study explores the influence law of different dissolved oxygen on the Fe base heat exchange surface corrosion, and the base metal corrosion mechanism for experimental study provides a theoretical reference...|$|E
40|$|The collisional {{relaxation}} of highly excited molecules plays {{a very important}} role in many chemistry processes. The work presented in this thesis studies the collisional quenching dynamics of highly vibrationally excited molecules using high–resolution transient IR absorption spectroscopy. This work investigates “weak” (small energy transfer) and “strong” (large energy transfer) collisions between donor and bath molecules. The experimental results illustrate how the properties of donor molecules influence the collisional energy transfer. These properties include the molecular structure, internal <b>energy,</b> <b>state</b> <b>density.</b> In several weak collision studies, this thesis studies the vibration–rotation/translation pathway for pyrazine/DCl, pyrazine/CO 2 with different internal energies and for three excited alkylated pyridine molecules/CO 2 systems. A single–exponential rotational distribution and J–dependent translational energy distributions of scattered DCl molecules are observed. For CO 2 collisions, the scattered CO 2 has a biexponential rotational distribution and J–dependent translational energy distributions for all collision pairs. Recoil velocities scale with product angular momenta. The observed collision rates for these collision pairs match Lennard–Jones rates. The full energy transfer distribution for these pairs is determined by combining data for weak and strong collisions. Lowering the internal energy of donor molecules reduces the amount of rotational and translational energy transfer to CO 2. Reducing the internal energy of pyrazine decreases the probabilities of strong collision and increases the probabilities of weak collision. The average energy transfer reduces by ∼ 50 % when the internal energy is decreased by only 15 %. The collision rates are independent on the internal energy for these systems. Methylation of donor molecules decreases the magnitude of V—RT energy transfer. The collision results are affected by the number of methyl–groups, and not by the position of the group. Increasing the number of methyl groups increases the ratio of the measured collision rate to the Lennard–Jones collision rate. In the strong collision studies, the effects of alkylation and internal energy are studied. In collisions with alkylated pyridine donors with E ∼ 39000 cm − 1, CO 2 molecules gain less energy from alkylpyridine than from pyridine. The alkylated donors undergo strong collisions with CO 2 via a less repulsive part of the intermolecular potential compared to pyridine. For azulene/CO 2 collisions with two different internal energies, scattered CO 2 molecules gain double the amount of rotational and translational energy when the azulene energy is doubled. The rate of strong collisions increases four times when the internal energy is doubled...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{following}} question: Which kinds of symmetry protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonians can be many-body localized? That is, which Hamiltonians with an SPT ground <b>state</b> have finite <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> excited <b>states</b> {{which are all}} localized by disorder? Based on the observation that a finite <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> <b>state,</b> if localized, {{can be viewed as}} the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, we propose a simple (though possibly incomplete) rule for many-body localization of SPT Hamiltonians: If the ground state and top <b>state</b> (highest <b>energy</b> <b>state)</b> belong to the same SPT phase, then it is possible to localize all the finite energy density states; If the ground and top state belong to different SPT phases, then most likely there are some finite <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> <b>states</b> which can not be fully localized. We will give concrete examples of both scenarios. In some of these examples, we argue that interaction can actually "assist" localization of finite <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> <b>states,</b> which is counter-intuitive to what is usually expected.
