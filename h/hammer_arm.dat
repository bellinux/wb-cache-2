50|$|Nintendo Badge Arcade {{takes place}} in an arcade filled with {{machines}} known as Badge Catchers, each containing badges based on various Nintendo franchises such as Super Mario, Animal Crossing, The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Pokémon which are reorganised regularly. The arcade is hosted by a pink, anthropomorphic rabbit character called Arcade Bunny, who always greets the player, and often introduces promotional events. The Badge Catchers are viewed from a 2d side-on perspective. Similar to real-life UFO catchers, players must move the catcher's claw side to side, pick up badges, and try and drop them off the bottom-left of the screen. They can accomplish this by simply picking them up, or use other techniques such as pushing them or causing land-slides (this only works {{if there is a}} big pile of badges). Some Badge Catchers use alternate means of obtaining badges. The <b>Hammer</b> <b>Arm</b> knocks badges sideways towards the hole, the Bomb Arm blasts badges away in all directions, and the Stick Arm (which originally went unused, but was first revealed on April 28, 2016 in Japan) sticks badges onto the arm. Any badges that the player obtains can be placed on the Nintendo 3DS' HOME Menu, with certain badges able to launch some of the 3DS' built-in applications. Most badges can also be used as decorations for the Swapdoodle messaging app.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of collecting rapping system in electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and controlling the relevant damage under impact loading, fatigue durability of this system is analyzed in the present study based on the numerical and experimental results considering fatigue damage growth and vibration acceleration in the collecting system because of the successive impact of rapping hammers. By microscopic examination of the fracture surface of rapping hammer, beach marks obviously show typical fatigue failure in the rapping <b>hammer</b> <b>arm.</b> In addition, the microscopic examination of the cross section of the collecting plates indicates the corrosion voids which cause crack and eventually fatigue failure. The finite element method is applied to determine both the stress and concentration positions of dynamic stress on the rapping system under impact loading. The paper results can be utilized in system optimization and new material selection for the system by evaluating rapping system durability...|$|E

60|$|Marston fell {{forward with}} his oar and fought for breath. His heart beat like a <b>hammer,</b> his <b>arms</b> and legs trembled, {{and he felt}} he had not {{strength}} to lift his head. Then the end of his oar struck something and they were alongside Columbine. Rousing himself with an effort, he leaned out and seized a rope. Wyndham got up and began to lift the mast.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, he {{was brought}} into the WWWF for title matches with {{champion}} Bruno Sammartino. They met three times in Madison Square Garden—Sheik won the first via count out, he was disqualified in the second, and he lost to Bruno in a Texas Death Match via submission when Bruno grabbed a foreign object (pen) and <b>hammered</b> Sheik's <b>arm</b> to a bloody pulp. Sammartino and Sheik also {{had a series of}} matches in Boston, including one sell out the day after a crippling snow storm, and public transportation not yet restored.|$|R

50|$|The Hammering Man is a worker. The Hammering Man {{celebrates the}} worker. He {{or she is}} the village craftsman, the South African coal miner, the {{computer}} operator, the farmer or the aerospace worker-the people who produce the commodities on which we depend. This Hammering Man is 48 feet tall. It is constructed of steel (hollow-fabricated) and weighs over 20,000 pounds. A structural steel base-plate is bolted to a cement-block footing below ground level so that the architect's chosen material for the plaza can be brought up to flush to {{the feet of the}} sculpture. The Hammering Man appears to be standing (and working) on the plaza without a base in between. The black silhouette of the figure is, in fact, 30 inches wide: body (10 inches), arm (10 inches), space between arm and body (10 inches), as well as an extra 16 inches width at the top for the motor. The motorized <b>hammering</b> <b>arm</b> will move smoothly and meditatively up and down at a rate of four times per minute. Electricity runs from the motor down inside the sculpture and under the plaza to an on-off switch location. The Hammering Man is set on a timer and rests during evening and early morning hours. The sculpture has been sited so that the many pedestrians and drivers moving up and down First Avenue can enjoy the animated form while contemplating the meaning of the Hammering Man in their own lives.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} co-produced by Robert L. Lippert, an American movie {{producer}} and distributor. Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed {{them in the}} United States. In return, <b>Hammer's</b> distribution <b>arm,</b> Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom. Lippert's company was, in fact, a front for 20th Century Fox, whose president, Spyros Skouras, {{was a close friend}} of Lippert's. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.|$|R
60|$|From {{the forced}} repentance of invalid mutineers and disbanded thieves you {{can hope for}} no resource. Government itself, which ought to {{constrain}} the more bold and dexterous of these robbers, is their accomplice. Its arms, its treasures, its all are in their hands. Judicature, which above all things should awe them, is their creature and their instrument. Nothing {{seems to me to}} render your internal situation more desperate than this one circumstance of the state of your judicature. Many days are not passed since we have seen a set of men brought forth by your rulers for a most critical function. Your rulers brought forth a set of men, steaming from the sweat and drudgery, and all black with the smoke and soot, of the forge of confiscation and robbery,--ardentis massæ fuligine lippos,--a set of men brought forth from the trade of <b>hammering</b> <b>arms</b> of proof, offensive and defensive, in aid of the enterprises, and for the subsequent protection, of housebreakers, murderers, traitors, and malefactors,--men, who had their minds seasoned with theories perfectly conformable to their practice, and who had always laughed at possession and prescription, and defied all the fundamental maxims of jurisprudence. To the horror and stupefaction of all the honest part of this nation, and indeed of all nations who are spectators, we have seen, on the credit of those very practices and principles, and to carry them further into effect, these very men placed on the sacred seat of justice in the capital city of your late kingdom. We see that in future you are to be destroyed with more form and regularity. This is not peace: it is only the introduction of a sort of discipline in their hostility. Their tyranny is complete in their justice; and their lanterne is not half so dreadful as their court.|$|R

50|$|The first toy {{for this}} version of Ultra Magnus was {{released}} in 2008 and transformed from a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck to robot. He came with a spring-loaded Magnus <b>Hammer</b> and is <b>armed</b> with numerous guns mounted on his shoulders. The figure emits two sound effects and phrases as voiced by Jeff Bennett. This toy was later recolored in a green, black, and orange theme, in homage to Generation 1 Roadbuster. The version released in Japan in 2010 had metallic paint and Japanese voice clips.|$|R
5000|$|The AKM has a {{modified}} trigger assembly, {{equipped with a}} hammer-release delaying device (installed on the same axis pin together with the trigger and disconnector) commonly called a [...] "rate reducer". In fact its primary purpose is not to reduce the rate of automatic fire; it is a safety device to ensure the weapon will only fire on automatic when the bolt is fully locked, as the hammer is tripped by the bolt carrier's last few millimetres of forward movement. The device also reduces [...] "trigger slap" [...] or [...] "trigger bounce" [...] and the weapon’s rate of fire, which also reduces the dispersion of bullets when firing in fully automatic mode. The hammer was also changed and equipped with a protrusion that engages the rate reducer and the trigger has only one notched <b>hammer</b> release <b>arm</b> (compared to two parallel arms in the AK-47).|$|R
50|$|Designed by Chace Younger from California, C4 {{was built}} in {{reaction}} to the multi-pivot flippers introduced in the 2004 World Championship, and featured an innovative new take on the design. Chace fitted <b>hammers</b> to the <b>arm</b> of his flipper, which automatically fired whenever the flipper was activated. This meant that, if the flipper failed to overturn an opponent, the hammers would strike and salvage a point. This perfect weapon synergy won C4 back-to-back World Championships in 2005 and 2006. It was retired, unbeaten, when Chace became too old to compete.|$|R

In remembrance and honor of Ghal Maraz, the Order of the Silver <b>Hammer,</b> the martial <b>arm</b> of the Sigmarite cult, use warhammers in battle.

5000|$|In Louis XIV's [...] "Armorial de la Généralité d’Alsace", Sainte Marie-aux-Mines's {{coat of arms}} is {{described}} {{in the following way}} : a blue field with a silver-colored representation of Our Lady putting her feet on a golden mountain. The current coats of arms granted on 28 July 1892 can be described as follows: dexter (heraldric right) the arms of Ribeaupierre (a silver field with three red shields), sinister (heraldric left) the arms of Lorraine (a gold field with a red band containing three silver eagles), with both surmounted by a central shield bearing the miners' symbol (a black field bearing two crossed silver-colored mining <b>hammers).</b> These <b>arms</b> evoke both the geographic and political situation of the city until the French Revolution and the mining industry for which it was famous. The city is a holder of the Croix de guerre 1914-1918 with palm (citation by order of the Army of November 2, 1921) and of the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 with vermeil star (citation by order of the armed force).|$|R
50|$|Church {{adopted the}} <b>Arm</b> & <b>Hammer</b> {{trademark}} from the Vulcan Spice Mills {{company that was}} owned {{by one of his}} sons and used it to sell baking soda (one of the uses for bicarbonate of soda). It was the same product as Cow Brand was selling. Dwight continued selling the original baking product under his Cow Brand trademark and in a similar packaging style as <b>Arm</b> & <b>Hammer</b> baking soda. <b>Arm</b> & <b>Hammer</b> baking soda dominated the market in the United States, while Cow brand was preferred in only a few places. The descendants of Church and Dwight united the two firms in 1896 into Church & Dwight Company.|$|R

5|$|Heath {{gets out}} of jail and walks in on Charlie and Brax together. Charlie tells the Inspector about her {{relationship}} with Brax, but he allows her stay with the case.

Charlie tells Brax they should be together, but she changes her mind when she learns Brax had sex with Hayley.|$|R
50|$|Gravity also acts at a distance, {{without an}} {{apparent}} energy source, {{but to get}} energy out of a gravitational field (for instance, by dropping a heavy object, producing kinetic energy as it falls) one has to put energy in (for instance, by lifting the object up), and some energy is always dissipated in the process. A typical application of gravity in a perpetual motion machine is Bhaskara's wheel in the 12th century, whose key idea is itself a recurring theme, often called the overbalanced wheel: moving weights are attached to a wheel {{in such a way}} that they fall to a position further from the wheel's center for one half of the wheel's rotation, and closer to the center for the other half. Since weights further from the center apply a greater torque, it was thought that the wheel would rotate forever. However, since the side with weights further from the center has fewer weights than the other side, at that moment, the torque is balanced and perpetual movement is not achieved. The moving weights may be <b>hammers</b> on pivoted <b>arms,</b> or rolling balls, or mercury in tubes; the principle is the same.|$|R
