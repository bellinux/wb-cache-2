The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series.|$|E

The Calvin cycle, which fixes CO into sugar takes place in the stroma.|$|E
25|$|The first {{event of}} {{importance}} following the armistice was the dinner on 13 November, given {{in one of}} the hangars to celebrate {{the first anniversary of the}} squadron's arrival in France.

25|$|However, {{a run of}} {{just two}} {{victories}} in eleven games for Hughes' side saw City fail to capitalise on their early season form, and the burden of pressure on Hughes began to grow considerably. On 19 December 2009, only hours after a 4–3 win over Sunderland, Hughes was sacked, despite the club sitting in sixth {{in the league and}} having only lost twice. The Italian Roberto Mancini, formerly of Inter Milan, was appointed his successor. Rumours had begun <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> early on Saturday amongst the media, prior to the game, that Hughes would lose his job, notwithstanding the Sunderland result.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{prevented him from}} returning, however. As {{an expert on the}} East, the Foreign Office asked him to summarise the many different strategic ideas <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> in the ministry. The result was his Denkschrift betreffend die Revolutionierung der islamischen Gebiete unserer Feinde ("Memorandum on revolutionizing the Islamic territories of our enemies") of October 1914. The memo argued for enlisting the Sultan to call on the world's Muslims to engage in a Holy War against the colonial powers, France and Great Britain. To develop the necessary propaganda, the Nachrichtenstelle für den Orient (Intelligence Bureau for the East) was established in Berlin. Oppenheim became its head.|$|E
25|$|At the 3D Summit {{conference held}} in September 2010 at Universal Studios, {{producer}} Brian Rogers confirmed a planned date of 2012. The reboot is a live-action project featuring a fully computer-generated Godzilla. Godzilla fought {{at least one}} or two monsters, rather than simply the military as seen in Emmerich's 1998 film. Rogers also confirmed that the two Godzilla head designs that were <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> the Internet and rumored to have been designed by Legendary and sent to Toho for approval were fake, and were just simply fan-made. He also {{went on to say}} that he and Legendary Pictures wished to revive Godzilla in the same fashion Legendary had revived Batman.|$|E
25|$|Preparation for {{development}} of the next Persona title began in 2010. Rumors of its development were <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> since 2009, when Sony's mobile website listed Katsura Hashino as the game's director. According to another source, preparatory work {{was going on in}} 2008 while Persona 4 was still in development. Preparatory development was nearing completion in August 2011, with full development beginning after that following the completion of Catherine. Hashino was only fully involved in development after Catherine was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next Persona title's development. Development lasted five years. When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modelling work for the Trauma Team series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.|$|E

500|$|A team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the [...] "Laboratario del Restauro" [...] in Florence spent {{ten years}} reapplying paint.

The tiny specks of pigment <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976.|$|E

That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were <b>floating</b> <b>around,</b> calling for help.

That's not who we are." [...] Among Republican members of Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the decision and stated that he wanted to see the photos released, while Senator John McCain and Representative Mike Rogers, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, supported the decision not to release the photos.|$|E

500|$|In 1866 Anderssen lost a {{close match}} with 30-year-old Wilhelm Steinitz (six wins, eight losses, and no draws; Steinitz {{won the last}} two games). Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the {{positional}} approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority, the 1866 match was played in the attack-at-all-costs style of the 1850s and 1860s. This is generally seen as {{the point at which}} Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world's leading active player. Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> since the 1840s, the 1866 Anderssen–Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship, and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive. [...] Furthermore, Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments and in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871.|$|E
500|$|A player using {{a second}} {{controller}} can {{join in the}} game at any time. The second player will initially appear as a mask <b>floating</b> <b>around</b> Crash.

Coco is not available for play until she is defeated in a boss fight, after which she is fully playable (though the player can choose to continue with Carbon Crash). This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster.|$|E

He was sent off {{in the first game}} of the season after attempting to headbutt Chesterfield's Steve Blatherwick. He captained the [...] "Minstermen" [...] for the first and only time at Bootham Crescent against Cheltenham Town, before he went in for some keyhole surgery to clean out his knee.
