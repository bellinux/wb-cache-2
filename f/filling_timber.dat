50|$|Horn Rapids Dam (also {{known as}} Wanawish Dam) is a rock <b>filled</b> <b>timber</b> crib barrage dam on the Yakima River in Benton County, Washington near the {{intersection}} of SR 240 and SR 225. The dam is not used for hydroelectric production, rather to fill irrigation canals on either bank of the river.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, {{tools such as}} the {{earthmover}} made it cheaper to construct a high fill directly instead of first constructing a trestle from which to dump the <b>fill.</b> <b>Timber</b> trestles remain common in some applications, most notably for bridge approaches crossing floodways, where earth fill would dangerously obstruct floodwater.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} on these structures spanned a 62-year period between 1857 and 1919. The substructures {{installed at the}} time consist of stone <b>filled</b> <b>timber</b> cribs, close driven round timber piles, and wood plank sheet piles. In addition, most of the substructure {{is covered with a}} steel sheet pile facade which was installed between 1951 and 1983. A slab concrete superstructure was built along the piers and revetments between 1916 and 1938.|$|R
5000|$|The Black Rock Dam is a {{low head}} dam in the Schuylkill River. Originally {{constructed}} as a stone <b>filled,</b> <b>timber</b> crib dam in the early 19th century by the Schuylkill Navigation Company, the dam was one of dozens built to create a slack water pools for the Schuylkill Navigation System. The dam is a contributing property of the [...] "Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section" [...] registered historic district. The dam is located between Phoenixville and Mont Clare in southeastern Pennsylvania, USA.|$|R
40|$|Building {{envelopes}} {{are designed}} to regulate dynamic flows between interior and exterior environment. The paper presents {{a new type of}} sustainable building material made of rich lime and hemp chips and focuses on a particular mixture used to <b>fill</b> <b>timber</b> framed structures. Most of material’s hygrothermal parameters were measured in the Fraunhofer-Institut for Building Physics in Holzkirchen and its specific behaviour under transient conditions is studied through simulations with WUFIÒ 4. 0 software. Three case studies were defined to point out its thermal and hygric inertia. According to bioclimatic principles, these effects can help architects and designers to combine comfort feelings and low energy demand. Results are compared to other materials and future works are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{sustainable}} {{aspects of human}} development as energy savings, comfort, health and life-cycles, led to an increased interest on new insulation materials. Lime-Hemp Concrete (LHC) is a light, porous and hygroscopic insulation material made out of hemp chips mixed with an appropriate lime binder. It can be use either to cover masonry walls or to <b>fill</b> <b>timber</b> frame structures, in old or new buildings. The paper first presents this innovative material {{on the basis of}} a thorough literature survey. Laboratory experiments were conducted in the Fraunhofer-Institut for Building Physics and corresponding transport and storage parameters are defined. Dynamical interactions between heat and mass flows in material’s porous structure are then analyzed though numerical simulations...|$|R
50|$|The Navigation Structures at Saugatuck Harbor {{consist of}} two piers, 200 feet apart and parallel, {{flanking}} {{the mouth of}} the Kalamazoo River. The North Pier is 2,778 feet long and the South Pier is 2,514 feet long. Lights are located on the end of each pier. The extreme outer portions of the piers are stone <b>filled</b> <b>timber</b> cribs, each 24 feet wide and 100 feet long Riprap is placed {{on both sides of the}} crib. Inland of the cribs, the remaining pier sections are constructed of wood piling spaced 13 feet apart and filled with stone. The shoreward sections are 13-14 feet wide and built with wood pilings and filled with stone. The piers were capped with concrete in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|St Mark's has hammerbeam {{roof trusses}} and the {{underside}} of the roof is lined with diagonally arranged timber boarding. High level openings, which are now generally of glass louvres, were previously <b>filled</b> with <b>timber</b> panels, operable from inside the church, allowing light and ventilation. Some of these panels remain.|$|R
5000|$|The Consolidated Water Power Company was {{incorporated}} on 16 July 1894 {{with the goal}} of consolidating the six companies using portions of the water power of the Grand Rapids. After disputes, Nels Johnson and J.D. Witter, the last two original owners, purchased the remainder of the company in 1901, renaming it the Consolidated Water Power and Paper Company the following year. Witter died in 1902, followed by Johnson nine months later. [...] Witter’s son-in-law, George W. Mead, took over as president. The 2,000 foot long dam was completed in March 1904. It was made from stone <b>filled</b> <b>timber</b> cribs with hemlock beams. The mill became operational on April 26, 1904 and began producing paper on June 3. An early client was the Methodist Sunday Schools, which used sixty tons of paper monthly.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a concrete floor, not original. The walls are sheeted at about three-quarter height with timber slats to provide ventilation.

50|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century both ponds had been <b>filled</b> in {{creating}} <b>timber</b> yards and sidings; this pattern of use was retained until closure. One major use of the dock was for the trade in timber, there were also facilities for cattle import including abattoirs and cold stores, coal was also exported through the dock.|$|R
50|$|Fortified hilltop {{settlements}} {{become common}} in the Urnfield period. Often a steep spur was used, where {{only part of the}} circumference had to be fortified. Depending on the locally available materials, dry-stone walls, gridded <b>timbers</b> <b>filled</b> with stones or soil or plank and palisade type pfostenschlitzmauer fortifications were used. Other fortified settlements used rivers-bends and swampy areas.|$|R

50|$|The Castlelaw Hill Fort is {{the remnant}} of a stronghold of the Iron Age. When it was {{occupied}} the site {{consisted of three}} earthwork ramparts, ditches and timber palisades. The fort contained a Souterrain for the storage of agricultural produce. V. Gordon Childe undertook excavations at Castlelaw in 1932 - 33. The work focussed on the rampart, and showed that it consisted of a clay and <b>timber</b> <b>filling,</b> faced by stone.|$|R
50|$|This {{structure}} is sited approximately seven to ten metres further east {{from the office}} and bookkeeper's quarters described above. Rectangular in plan, it has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron, the ridge of which runs from east to west. Its wall and roof framing members are made from rough hewn timber posts, in between which have been inserted some sections of vertical adzed timber slabs and some of corrugated iron. Its northern elevation is entirely open, with only the timber posts visible, while the short sides facing east and west are partly filled. The elevation facing south is entirely <b>filled</b> with <b>timber</b> slab and corrugated iron panels. The whole {{structure is}} leaning heavily. A Banyan Tree (Ficus bengalensis) stands adjacent to the south-eastern of this structure.|$|R
50|$|Tributaries of Muddy Boggy Creek include Sand, Caney Boggy, Rock, East Fork, Coal, Caney (Coon), North Boggy, McGee, Cold Spring, Lick and Crowder creeks. Major tributaries of Clear Boggy Creek are Jackfork, Coal, Goose, Leader, Delaware, Sandy, Caney, Fronterhouse, Cowpen, Bois d'Arc and Meyhew creeks. According to Pigg, {{all of the}} tributaries in the {{headwaters}} are short and deep, while those in the lower elevations are short, shallow and <b>filled</b> with dead <b>timber.</b>|$|R
50|$|A box crib is the simplest, {{most stable}} and most common method of cribbing. It is {{constructed}} by arranging sets (2 or more) of matched blocks {{in a regular}} log-cabin style to form a rising square or rectangular frame. The more blocks on each level, the greater the number of support points and therefore the greater {{the strength of the}} crib tower. In trench rescue training materials three basic types of box cribbing are the 4-point, 9-point and full crib. The four point type has two timbers on each level thus four points of contact. Three timbers on each layer makes nine points of contact. The full crib type has each layer <b>filled</b> with <b>timbers.</b> Each point of contact carries a maximum load depending on the size and species of the timbers.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were {{likely to have been}} similar to those found in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of <b>timber</b> <b>filled</b> with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.|$|R

Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs, particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC), and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least [...] of detritus mud.|$|R
5|$|The {{village was}} built in about 300 BC and {{occupied}} into the early Roman period (around 100AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to {{a rise in the}} water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of <b>timber</b> <b>filled</b> with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay. The village housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. At its maximum it may have had 15 houses with a population of up to 200 people.|$|R
