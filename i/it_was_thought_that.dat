5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E

5000|$|Fibroblast stimulation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{fibroblast}} stimulation by {{the thyroid}} stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor increases the deposition of glycosaminoglycan, which results in an osmotic edema and fluid retention. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> many cells responsible for forming connective tissue react to increases in TSH levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{the hamlet}} <b>was</b> {{so named because}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a common {{settling}} point for Gypsies, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> once <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Gypsies came from Egypt.|$|R
5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer. During the U.S. Civil War, {{saltpeter}} {{was collected}} from caves to make gunpowder; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this was bat guano, {{but most of the}} nitrate comes from nitrifying bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople and {{neighboring}} provinces also suffered extensive damage. Initially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Constantinople, {{the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, had been completely destroyed. A letter from Petrovaradin described particular devastation in the Galata district, Topkapı Palace, the Hagia Sophia and the Edirne bazaar. The main shock and subsequent aftershocks lasted up to 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased {{the risk of}} hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to}} be incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E

5|$|Initially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the {{compromise}} of HD DVD's security would entice some studios into adopting the competing Blu-ray format, but Blu-ray's AACS implementation {{has since been}} circumvented using a similar method.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Bradman {{would play}} Ring, but {{he changed his}} mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

50|$|The Finke River {{normally}} drains {{into the}} Simpson Desert {{to the north}} west of the Macumba, but {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Finke flowed directly into the Macumba. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Finke has flowed to Lake Eyre via the Macumba in 1909, 1938 and 1945.|$|R
5|$|Prior to 1983, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{the whole}} Sun {{has the same}} {{composition}} as the solar atmosphere. In 1983, it was claimed that it was fractionation in the Sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Stanton fell into the first-class category, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the fort would be needed to defend the Washington Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, {{and so was}} the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death in 1938, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> his wife, Emma Cruft, would {{continue}} to run the dog shows with the help of the show's secretary, Miss Hardingham. After running the show in 1939, Mrs Cruft sold the show to The Kennel Club, however due to World War II, it wasn't until 1948 when they ran the show for the first time. The show would remain being called Cruft's until 1974, when during a rebrand the apostrophe was dropped, resulting in the show being called Crufts, which it continues to be called at the present.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, {{it was reported that}} a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been agreed. The very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
