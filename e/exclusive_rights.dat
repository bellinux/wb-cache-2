5|$|This {{led to an}} {{international}} political conflict. The Dutch rejected <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> for the English, claiming the mare liberum principle. Christian IV claimed that Denmark–Norway had the rights {{to all of the}} Northern Sea in lieu of Greenland being an old Norwegian tax-land, and it was believed at the time by all parties that Spitsbergen was part of Greenland. England offered to purchase the rights from Denmark–Norway in 1614, but the offer was rejected, after which the English reverted to their <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> claim. Denmark–Norway sent three man-of-wars in 1615 to collect taxes from English and Dutch whalers, but all refused to pay.|$|E
5|$|Live English top-flight {{football}} {{has remained}} off free-to-air television in Britain, with few exceptions. It {{was not until}} 2006 that BSkyB's monopoly on Premier League television rights was broken; this came after {{an investigation by the}} European Commission which concluded that <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> should not be sold to one television company. Setanta Sports was awarded two packages, but encountered financial difficulties by 2009 and went into administration. Their rights were sold to ESPN, who showed a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season and subsequently 23 from 2010–11 to 2012–13. In June 2012, the Premier League awarded BT rights to 38 games over three seasons, starting from 2013–14. BT's introduction into the football broadcasting market has been considered a threat to BSkyB's dominance, particularly as the company was awarded <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to live UEFA Champions League football in 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{with its}} first {{location}} in Skokie, Illinois, Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations {{spread throughout the}} state. The Hootses, claiming that their trademark gave them <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state, and later federal, courts under the case Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968). The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that the BK federal trademark, applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20-mile (32km) radius centered on their original location.|$|E

5|$|A {{conflict}} arose with Paramount {{over the}} film's budget. Foster had thirty days {{to set up}} a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights.</b> He was inundated with offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very profitable if the film was a box office hit.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, a 45-minute {{documentary}} was released that provided candid glimpses behind the scenes of the music video's production. Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, like the music video, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market the cassette, in a profit participation agreement.|$|E

The Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania (now part of Exxon) had <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to provide filling station services on the sections of the system that opened prior to 1950, principally the Irwin-to-Carlisle section.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. He decided that Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E

5|$|Svalbard was {{undoubtedly}} spotted by Willem Barentsz of the Netherlands in 1596, {{although it may}} have previously have been discovered by Norsemen or Pomors. The Muscovy Company of England started walrus hunting on Bjørnøya in 1604, and from 1611 the company's Jonas Poole started whaling around Spitsbergen. The following year the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers. The company claimed <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to the area and sent away the contenders. In 1613, seven armed English ships were sent on an expedition that expelled a few dozen Dutch, Spanish and French vessels.|$|E
