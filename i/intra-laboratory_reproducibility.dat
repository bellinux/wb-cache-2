40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quality of}} {{variable}} number of tandem repeats (VNTR) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was first investigated in 2009 in 37 laboratories worldwide. The results revealed an inter- and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> of respectively 60 % and 72 %. These data spurred {{an improvement in}} laboratory-specific assays and global standardisation of VNTR typing. OBJECTIVE: To measure {{the effects of the}} technical improvements and increased standardisation, a test panel consisting of 30 M. tuberculosis complex DNA samples was distributed for VNTR typing in 41 participating laboratories from 36 countries. RESULTS: The inter- and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> increased overall to respectively 78 % and 88 %. The 33 laboratories that participated in both the first and second proficiency studies improved their inter- and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> from 62 % and 72 % to respectively 79 % and 88 %. The largest improvement in reproducibility was detected in 10 laboratories that use an in-house polymerase chain reaction technique and perform amplicon sizing using gel electrophoresis. Detailed error analysis revealed a {{reduction in the number of}} systematic errors, sample exchange events and non-amplifiable loci. CONCLUSION: This second worldwide proficiency study indicates a substantial increase in the reproducibility of VNTR typing of M. tuberculosis.

The RFLP analysis was done by Southern hybridization with one of two types of probes found in multiple copies on the chromosome of L. monocytogenes. Six laboratories performed ribotyping. These laboratories used EcoRI enzyme to restrict the L, monocytogenes DNA and ribosomal RNA or DNA as the probe for Southern hybridizations. The seventh laboratory used NciI to restrict the DNA, and two probes, one randomly cloned and the other containing repeat sequences cloned from L, monocytogenes DNA. The overall discriminating power of ribotyping, as estimated by calculation of Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s index of diversity, ranged from 0. 83 to 0. 88 for the six laboratories. The discriminating power of the combination of two probes used by Laboratory 7 was 0. 91. Ribotyping and the cloned probes used by Laboratory 7 discriminated poorly between serotype 4 b strains. Neither method identified three atypical strains (identified by other subtyping methods) included in three apparently epidemiologically related groups. Ribotyping did not discriminate between strains of serotypes 4 b and 4 b(X) in one epidemiologically related group of strains; one cloned probe used by Laboratory 7 discriminated between these strains. <b>Intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibilities</b> for the seven laboratories ranged from 80. 0 to 100...|$|R

Methods This study assessed and compared {{the ability of}} eight Dutch laboratories under blinded conditions to discriminate VSSA from hGISA/GISA phenotypes and the intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility of agar screening plates and the Etest method. A total of 25 blinded and unique strains (10 VSSA, 9 hGISA and 6 GISA) were categorized by the PAP-AUC method and PFGE typed to eliminate clonal duplication. All strains were deliberately added in quadruplets to evaluate <b>intra-laboratory</b> variability and <b>reproducibility</b> of the methods. Strains were tested using three agar screening methods, Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI) + 6 μg/ml vancomycin, Mueller Hinton agar (MH) + 5 μg/ml vancomycin and MH + 5 μg/ml teicoplanin) and the Etest macromethod using a 2 McFarland inoculum. Results and Discussion The ability to detect the hGISA/GISA phenotypes varied significantly between methods and phenotypes. BHI vancomycin and MH vancomycin agar screens lacked the ability to detect hGISA. The MH teicoplanin agar screen was more sensitive but still inferior to Etest that had a sensitivity of 98. 5 % and 99. 5 %, for hGISA and GISA, respectively. Intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility varied between methods with poorest performance seen with BHI vancomycin. Conclusion This is the first multi-center blinded study to be undertaken evaluating various methods to detect GISA and hGISA. These data showed that the ability of clinical laboratories to detect GISA and hGISA varied considerably, and that screening plates with vancomycin have a poor performance in detecting hGISA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Isotope Dilution-Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb geochronology affords the {{opportunity}} to determine 206 Pb/ 238 U dates with unprecedented precision - often < 1 ‰ on single analyses or weighted mean dates derived from multiple analyses. The accuracy of these dates is dominated by (1) the U/Pb tracer calibration; (2) massspectrometry, (3) various corrections applied (such as those for U oxide), and (4) ‘constants’ used in the age calculation (decay constants and the 235 U/ 238 U value of natural U). Some of these parameters {{can be considered as}} ‘systematic’ (i. e., decay constant uncertainties) and others either contain a random component (not accounted for by counting statistics) or are systematic but ‘laboratory’ specific. Quantification and consideration of these uncertainties is required for the high-resolution integration of U-Pb datasets. At present inter-laboratory agreement and <b>intra-laboratory</b> long-term external <b>reproducibility</b> of U-Pb ID-TIMS data is assessed through analyses of natural zircon ‘standards’. Though standard zircons are ideal for assessing the total system (pretreatment for Pb-loss, dissolution, purification via anion echange chemistry and mass-spectrometry), there is the possibility for real variation in the U/Pb systematics (due to either Pb-loss and/or natural age variation). We have prepared and calibrated a series of synthetic U-Pb solutions with 206 Pb/ 238 U and 207 Pb/ 235 U ratios that yield “concordant” 206 Pb- 238 U and 207 Pb- 235 U dates at 100 Ma, 500 Ma and 2 Ga. The solutions were prepared by iterative mixing of natural uranium (SRM 950 a), 206 Pb (SRM 991) and 207 Pb (metal from Cambridge Isotopes) solutions. Determination of the 206 Pb- 238 U and 207 Pb- 235 U ratios is being achieved via calibration against the ET 535 and ET 2535 tracers. These solutions are ideal for monitoring mass-spectrometer performanace. We believe these solutions will augment natural zircon standards as a means of interlaboratory comparsion and assessment of long-term external reproducibility. These solutions are intended for community use and will be made available (visit: www. earth-time. org) ...|$|R

In a majority of cases, NMO is associated with antibodies to aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) (termed NMO-IgG). Aims: In this study, we evaluated a new multiparametric indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay for NMO serology. Methods: Sera from 20 patients with NMO, 41 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 30 healthy subjects, and a commercial anti-AQP 4 IgG antibody were tested in a commercial composite immunofluorescence assay ("Neurology Mosaic 17 "; Euroimmun, Germany), consisting of five different diagnostic substrates (HEK cells transfected with AQP 4, non-transfected HEK cells, primate cerebellum, cerebrum, and optic nerve tissue sections). Results: We identified AQP 4 specific and non-specific fluorescence staining patterns and established positivity criteria.

A complete and didactic chemometric study is described herein for the optimization of an analytical method involving stir bar sorptive extraction followed by thermal desorption coupled with gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (SBSE-TD-GC-MS/MS) for the rapid quantification of several pesticides in freshwaters. We studied, under controlled conditions, the effects of thermal desorption parameters and the effects of their interactions on the desorption efficiency. The desorption time, temperature, flow, and the injector temperature were optimized through a screening design and a Box Behnken design. The two sequential designs allowed establishing an optimum set of conditions for maximum response. Then, we present the comprehensive validation and the determination of measurement uncertainty of the optimized method. Limits of quantification determined in different natural waters were in the range of 2. 5 ng L- 1 to 50 ng L- 1 and recoveries were between 90 and 104 %, depending on the pesticide. The whole method uncertainty, assessed at 3 concentration levels under <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> conditions, was below 25 % for all tested pesticides. Hence, we optimized and validated a robust analytical method to quantify the target pesticides at low concentration levels in freshwater samples, with a simple, fast, and solventless desorption step...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} liquid chromatographic method for {{the determination of}} seven sulphonamides in animal tissues was validated. The measurement uncertainty of the method was estimated using two approaches – a ‘top-down' approach based on in-house validation data, which used either repeatability data or <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility,</b> and a ‘bottom-up' approach, which included repeatability data from spiking experiments. The decision limits (CCα) applied in the EU were calculated for comparison. The bottom-up approach was used to identify critical steps in the analytical procedure, which comprised extraction, concentration, hexane-wash and HPLC-UV analysis. Six replicates of porcine kidney were fortified at the MRL (100 μg kg- 1) at three different stages of the analytical procedure, extraction, evaporation, and final wash/HPLC analysis, to provide repeatability data for each step. The uncertainties of the gravimetric and volumetric measurements were estimated and integrated in the calculation of the total combined uncertainties by the bottom-up approach. Estimates for systematic error components were included in both approaches. Combined uncertainty estimates for the seven compounds using the ‘top-down' approach ranged from 7. 9 - 12. 5 % (using reproducibility) and from 5. 4 - 9. 5 % (using repeatability data) and from 5. 1 - 9. 0 % using the bottom-up approach. CCα values, ranged from 105. 6 - 108. 5 μg kg- 1. The major contributor to the combined uncertainty for each analyte was identified as the extraction step. Since there was no statistical difference between the uncertainty values obtained by either approach, the analyst would be justified in applying the ‘top-down' estimation using method validation data, rather than performing additional experiments to obtain uncertainty data...|$|E

In this study, we developed a method for profiling lipophilic marine microalgal toxins based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-Orbitrap MS). Extraction of selected toxins (okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin- 1 (DTX- 1), pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX- 2), azaspiracid- 1 (AZA- 1), yessotoxin (YTX) and 13 -desmethyl spirolide C (SPX- 1)) was optimized using a Plackett-Burman design. Three key algal species, i. e., Prorocentrum lima, Protoceratium reticulatum and Alexandrium ostenfeldii were used to test the extraction efficiency of OA, YTXs and SPXs, respective- ly. Prorocentrum micans, fortified with certified reference so- lutions, was used for recovery studies. The quantitative and confirmatory performance of the method was evaluated according to CD 2002 / 657 /EC. Limits of detection andquantification ranged between 0. 006 and 0. 050 ng mL− 1 and 0. 018 to 0. 227 ng mL− 1, respectively. The <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> ranged from 6. 8 to 11. 7 %, repeatability from 6. 41 to 11. 5 % and mean corrected recoveries from 81. 9 to 119. 6 %. In addition, algae cultures were retrospectively screened for analogues and metabolites through a homemade database. Using the ToxID software programme, 18 toxin der- ivates were detected in the extract of three toxin producing microalgae species. In conclusion, the generic extraction and full-scan HRMS approach offers an excellent quantitative per- formance and simultaneously allows to profile analogues and metabolites of marine toxins in microalgae...|$|E
40|$|For future {{targeted}} screening in National Residue Control Programmes, the metabolism of seven SARMs, from the arylpropionamide and the quinolinone classes, was studied in vitro using S 9 bovine liver enzymes. Metabolites were detected and identified with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF-MS) and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS). Several metabolites {{were identified and}} results were compared with literature data on metabolism using a human cell line. Monohydroxylation, nitro-reduction, dephenylation and demethylation were the main S 9 in vitro metabolic routes established. Next, an in vivo study was performed by oral administration of the arylpropionamide ostarine to a male calf and urine samples were analysed with UPLC-QToF-MS. Apart from two metabolites resulting from hydroxylation and dephenylation that were also observed in the in vitro study, the bovine in vivo metabolites of ostarine resulted in glucuronidation, sulfation and carboxylation, combined with either a hydroxylation or a dephenylation step. As the intact mother compounds of all SARMs tested are the main compounds present after in vitro incubations, and ostarine is still clearly present in the urine after the in vivo metabolism study in veal calves, the intact mother molecules were selected as the indicator to reveal treatment. The analytical UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS procedure was validated for three commercially available arylpropionamides according to European Union criteria (Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC), and resulted in decision limits ranging from 0. 025 to 0. 05 µg l– 1 and a detection capability of 0. 025 µg l– 1 in all cases. Adequate precision and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> (relative standard deviation below 20 %) were obtained for all SARMs and the linearity was 0. 999 for all compounds. This newly developed method is sensitive and robust, and therefore useful for confirmation and quantification of SARMs in bovine urine samples for residue control programmes and research purposes...|$|E
40|$|The use of thyreostatic drugs, like thiouracil (TU), {{in animal}} {{production}} has been banned {{for over three}} decades by the European Union, due to potential teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of its residues upon human consumption. Besides, thyreostats induce water retention in livestock, causing fallacious weight gain and deterioration of meat quality. Development of more competent analytical methods gave rise to sporadic TU detection in urine of untreated animals, questioning the actual synthetic origin TU. Research showed that TU can be formed upon digestion of Brassicaceae feeds in vivo and in vitro, which called for a means of differentiation between endogenous formation of TU and illicit administration. Therefore, in the present study, a routinely applicable liquid chromatography (LC) ion trap multiple mass spectrometry (MS 2) method for TU analysis in animal feeds was optimised and validated, according to CD 2002 / 657 /EC. A fractional factorial Plackett-Burman design was used to optimise the extraction procedure for TU from Brassicaceae and non-Brassicaceae feeds. This resulted in the discrimination of five influential factors (amount of feed, myrosinase, pH 7 buffer, 3 -iodobenzyl bromide and elution solvent), for which the most optimal conditions were perfected. The limit of quantification for TU amounted 0. 5 ng g- 1. The individual recoveries for TU ranged between 90. 9 and 99. 7 %. Good results for repeatability and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> (RSD%) were observed, i. e. < 6. 0 and < 5. 2 %, respectively, for TU. Excellent linearity was proven based on determination coefficient (R 2 < 0. 99) and lack-of-fit test (F test, alfa = 0. 05). Subsequently, a selection of feeds sampled during European national monitoring campaigns were evaluated with the present method showing concentrations ranging from 0. 32 to 20. 60 ng g- 1, demonstrating {{the relevance of the}} method in the analysis of TU from animal feeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of toxicogenomics as a predictive tool for chemical risk assessment {{has been under}} evaluation by the toxicology community {{for more than a}} decade. However, toxicogenomics predominately remains a tool for investigative research rather than for regulatory risk assessment. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the current generation of microarray technology in combination with an in vitro experimental design was capable of generating robust, reproducible data of sufficient quality to show promise as a tool for regulatory risk assessment. To this end, we designed a prospective collaborative study to determine the level of inter- and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> between three independent laboratories. All Test Centres adopted the same protocols for all aspects of the toxicogenomic experiment including cell culture, chemical exposure, RNA extraction, microarray data generation and analysis. As a case study, the genotoxic carcinogen Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 were used to generate three comparable toxicogenomic data sets. High levels of technical reproducibility were demonstrated using a widely employed gene expression microarray platform. While differences at the global transcriptome level were observed between the Test Centres, a common subset of B[a]P responsive genes (n= 400 gene probes) was identified at all Test Centres which included many genes previously reported in the literature as B[a]P responsive. These data show promise that the current generation of microarray technology in combination with a standard in vitro experimental design can produce robust data that can be reproducibly generated in independent laboratories. Future work will need to determine whether in vitro model(s) can not only be reproducible but also predictive for a range of toxic chemicals with different mechanisms of action. Such an approach may potentially be part of future in vitro testing regimes for regulatory risk assessment. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{performance of}} the widely-used Cervista HPV HR test was compared to the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) test in a Dutch population-based cervical cancer screening program. In 900 scrapings of women with normal cytomorphology, specificity was 90 % (95 %CI: 87. 84 – 91. 87) for the Cervista HPV HR test and 96 % (95 %CI: 94. 76 – 97. 37) for the HC 2 test with 93 % agreement between both tests (k = 0. 5, p, 0. 001). The sensitivity for CIN 2 + using 65 scrapings of women with histological-confirmed CIN 2 + was 91 % (95 %CI: 80. 97 – 96. 51) for the Cervista HPV HR test and 92 % (95 %CI: 82. 94 – 97. 43) for the HC 2 test with 95 % agreement between both tests (k = 0. 7, p, 0. 001). Fifty-seven of 60 HC 2 negative/Cervista positive cases tested HPV-negative with PCR-based HPV assays; of these cases 56 % were defined as Cervista triple-positive with FOZ values in all 3 mixes higher than the second cut-off of 1. 93 (as set by manufacturer). By setting this cut-off at 5. 0, specificity improved significantly without affecting sensitivity. External validation of this new cut-off at 5. 0 in triple-positive scrapings of women selected from the SHENCCASTII database revealed that 22 / 24 histological normal cases now tested HPV-negative in the Cervista HPV HR test, while CIN 2 + lesions remained HPV-positive.

40|$|The {{detection}} of mutant spectra within the viral quasispecies {{is critical for}} therapeutic management of HIV- 1 infections. Routine clinical application of ultrasensitive genotyping requires reproducibility and concordance within and between laboratories. The goal {{of the study was}} to evaluate a new protocol on HIV- 1 drug resistance testing by 454 ultra-deep pyrosequencing (454 -UDS) in an international multicenter study. Sixteen blinded HIV- 1 subtype B samples were provided for 454 -UDS as both RNA and cDNA with viral titers of 88, 600 - 573, 000 HIV- 1 RNA copies/ml. Eight overlapping amplicons spanning protease (PR) codons 10 - 99 and reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 1 - 251 were generated using molecular barcoded primers. 454 -UDS was performed using the 454 Life Sciences/Roche GS FLX platform. PR and RT sequences were analyzed using 454 Life Sciences Amplicon Variant Analyzer (AVA) software. Quantified variation data were analyzed for <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> and inter-laboratory concordance. Routine population sequencing was performed using the ViroSeq HIV- 1 genotyping system. Eleven laboratories and the reference laboratory 454 Life Sciences sequenced the HIV- 1 sample set. Data presented are derived from seven laboratories and the reference laboratory since severe study protocol execution errors occurred in four laboratories leading to exclusion. The median sequencing depth across all sites was 1364 reads per position (IQR= 809 - 2065). 100 % of the ViroSeq-reported mutations were also detected by 454 -UDS. Minority HIV- 1 drug resistance mutations, defined as HIV- 1 drug resistance mutations identified at frequencies of 1 - 25 %, were only detected by 454 -UDS. Analysis of 10 preselected majority and minority mutations were consistently found across sites. The analysis of drug-resistance mutations detected between 1 and 10 % demonstrated high intra- and inter-laboratory consistency in frequency estimates for both RNA and prepared cDNA samples, indicating robustness of the method. HIV- 1 drug resistance testing using 454 ultra-deep pyrosequencing results in an accurate and highly reproducible, albeit complex, approach to the analysis of HIV- 1 mutant spectra, even at frequencies well below those detected by routine population sequencing...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{analysis}} of veterinary drugs and growth-promoting agents has shifted from target-oriented procedures, mainly based on liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS), towards an accurate mass full scan MS type of approach (such as time of flight (ToF) or Fourier Transform (FT) MS). The applicability of an HR-Orbitrap-MS for confirmatory analysis for growth-promoting agents in meat was compared, in a previous study, {{to that of a}} QqQ-MS but proved somewhat inferior with respect to the sensitivity. Therefore our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of a TripleTOF™ (QqTOF) instrument for anabolic steroids in meat, using accurate mass MS data (> 25, 000 FWHM) in combination with MS/MS acquisition at high acquisition speeds. For the development of a sensitive detection method, the fast Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) combining a TOF-MS survey scan and dependent TOF-MS/MS scans was compared to a scheduled and a more time consuming dedicated MRM algorithm. As a final attempt to increase the sensitivity, the analytical flow UHPLC was switched to a state-of-the-art microflow UHPLC, operating at a flow rate of 25 μL/min. Additionally, a full fractional statistical design was performed to simplify as well as optimize the current extraction procedure for anabolic steroids in meat. A review of the literature resulted in a selection of a subset of relevant parameters including e. g. variables related to the homogenisation of the meat (e. g. ultraturrax), solvents (e. g. solvent type and volume), sample clean-up (e. g. solid phase extraction) for optimisation. Afterwards the optimised method was validated according to CD 2002 / 657 /EC. In this study the benefits of the TripleTOF™ instrument are compared to a QqQ-MS system including it’s ability to mine the data retrospectively for identifying non-targeted and emerging designer hormones, which serves as an additional advantage {{in the light of the}} national control plans. Compared to the single stage Orbitrap the TripleTOF™, operates at a lower resolution, however due to the acquired MS/MS data it is expected to provide an advantage especially for those compounds (i. e. some estrogens) for which the threshold of 20 % <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility,</b> correlated to an inferior precision, was exceeded with the single stage Orbitrap.

In a previous study the applicability of HR-Orbitrap-MS for confirmatory analysis of growth-promoting agents in meat was compared to that of a QqQ-MS. Validation according to CD 2002 / 657 /EC demonstrated that steroid analysis based on single stage Orbitrap mass spectrometry, operating at a resolution of 50, 000 FWHM, is indeed capable to compete with QqQ-MS in terms of selectivity/specificity, while providing excellent linearity (for most compounds > 0. 99) but somewhat inferior sensitivity. Therefore our goal was to investigate the capability of a TripleTOF™ (QqTOF) instrument to provide sensitive high resolution accurate mass MS data (> 25, 000 FWHM) {{but at the same time}} MS/MS data at high acquisitions speeds. For the development of the detection method the fast Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) combining a TOF-MS survey scan followed by dependent TOF-MS/MS scans will be compared to the more time consuming workflow of optimizing the collision energy per compound. Afterwards a validation according to the CD/ 2002 / 657 /EC will be performed, in this way the accurate mass MS data is used to accurately quantify the targeted steroids and the additionally collected MS/MS spectra are used to confidently identify the compounds. The benefit of this instrument compared to the QqQ-MS is the ability to mine the data retrospectively for identifying non-targeted and unexpected compounds, which is beneficiary in the light of the national control plan of growth-promoting agents. When compared to the single stage Orbitrap, a lower resolution is obtained, however due to the acquired MS/MS data the TripleTOF™ is expected to provide an advantage especially for those compounds (i. e. some estrogens) for which the threshold of 20 % of repeatability and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility,</b> correlated to an inferior precision, was exceeded with the single stage Orbitrap.

40|$|Phytosterols are omnipresent in plants, as {{they play}} an {{important}} role in cell membrane stability and as signal transducers. Over the last few decades, the scientific interest in phytosterols has peaked. Most of the interest has focused on the cholesterol-lowering properties of phytosterols, but they may also interfere with the endogenous steroid hormone synthesis. This possible involvement in the synthesis, excretion and thus detection of steroids in sports or farm animals is currently under discussion as the conversion of phytosterols to steroids has been reported in different biological systems, mainly involving a variety of microorganisms. Additionally, recent work indicated that a novel mechanism of endogenous steroid-synthesis is to be considered: non-toxic feed-borne fungi, naturally present on animal feed, were shown capable of converting phytosterols into C 19 -steroids, which include AED, ADD, precursors of the androgenic-anabolic steroids boldenone and testosterone. Despite this dual interest in phytosterols, accurate and fully validated methods for the quantification of phytosterols are scarce, for food and especially for feed samples. During this study a new extraction and detection method was optimised and fully validated according to EC, AORC and EURC guidelines. A fractional factorial design was used to optimize the extraction procedure. This resulted in the discrimination of five influential factors (amount of sample, solvent, drying temperature, washing and hydrolysis), for which the most optimal conditions were perfected by Surface Response Modeling (SRM) (D-Optimal). Detection was carried out on a UHPLC-MS/MS equipment. The newly developed extraction and UHPLC-MS/MS detection method reached all evaluated performance parameters. The individual recoveries ranged between 90 and 107 %. Good results for repeatability and <b>intra-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> (RSD%) were observed (< 10 %).

Multiple feed samples, including grass, hay, straw, yellow peas, grains and apples, were analyzed, and all main phytosterols could be detected and quantified. Grass for example showed to contain 28 ± 2 mg β-sitosterol, 4. 1 ± 0. 3 mg campesterol and 0. 41 ± 0. 02 mg stigmasterol per 100 g fresh weight (25 % dry weight) ...|$|E
