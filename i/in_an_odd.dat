Mary is shown <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E
5|$|When {{the models}} were built, only skulls of the Cretaceous fossil Mosasaurus had been {{discovered}} in the Netherlands, so Hawkins only built the head and back of the animal. He submerged the model deep in the lake, leaving the body unseen and undefined. The Mosasaurus at Crystal Palace is positioned <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> place near the secondary island that was originally a waterfall, {{and much of it}} is not visible from the lakeside path.|$|E

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> way he looks forward {{to it as the}} only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

25|$|In modern belief, {{he is also}} {{regarded}} as founder of Vilnius, the modern capital of Lithuania. According to a legend, possibly set in 1322 {{while he was on}} a hunting trip, he dreamt of an iron clad wolf, who stood on a hill, howling <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> manner as if thousand of wolves would be howling at once. He consulted his vision with his priest Lizdeika who told him the dream spoke of a city that must be built at the exact place and decided to build a fortification on the confluence of rivers Vilnia and Neris, where the place of his vision was pointed out. This event inspired the Romantic movement, particularly Adam Mickiewicz, who gave the story a poetic form.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} few {{noteworthy}} {{performances in the}} later season single-day races. Kreder took tenth in a 25-rider sprint finish to the Coppa Ugo Agostoni in August. He was likewise tenth at Vattenfall Cyclassics, in a 34-rider finale. Hushovd turned in a strong ride at the GP Ouest-France, taking fourth place <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> finish. Sprinter Grega Bole jumped early for the win, while attackers Simon Gerrans and Thomas Voeckler were caught out {{between him and the}} peloton behind for second and third. Hushovd led the peloton across the line for fourth, but all the riders were credited with the same finishing time. Martin took a further two podium placings at Italian races in October. He finished third in the Memorial Marco Pantani, before just missing out on the victory at the fall monument, the Giro di Lombardia. He was the strongest rider in the five-rider chase group that trailed solo winner Oliver Zaugg, and won the sprint to take second overall. Millar rode to fifth place in the Chrono des Nations individual time trial, before Haussler closed out the team's season by winning a national-level event in his native Australia, the Noosa Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was {{described}} as a [...] "melodious boom-box midtempo" [...] borrowing [...] "heavily from roots reggae". It is heavily influenced by dub music and has a moderate reggae tempo. Its composition has been compared to his previous project with Travis McCoy on [...] "Billionaire" [...] and Sublime's work, as well as, a [...] "Michael Jackson-meets-Bedouin Soundclash" [...] According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song was composed in common time and in the key of C# minor with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Mars' and Marley's vocals range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of C6. The track is three minutes and fifty nine seconds. The song's lyrics describe feelings of [...] "pain" [...] and [...] "sorrow", using alcohol as method to flee [...] "bad fortune <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> foreshadowing of events". In the end, hope is found by [...] "getting messed up today" [...] since on the following day everything will be fine. Tyrone S.

500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Liquor Store Blues" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews by most music critics. Tyrone S. Reid, {{considered the}} song {{one of the}} best in the album, [...] "You simply canâ€™t get lyrics more droll or brainer than that." [...] The addition of Damien Marley made the track [...] "more alluring". DJ Gravy praised the fact that the song [...] "has a more authentic yard vibe, thanks to Black Chiney's Supa Dups", when comparing it to Mars and Travis McCoy's [...] "Billionaire". Slant Magazines Eric Henderson panned the song as [...] "sway gently with a hint of reggae swagger". Kevin Barber from the Consequence of Sound, who positively reviewed the album, wrote [...] "In return for all of his generous favors he has given other artists, they give back as well. Damien Marley joins him on the reggae jam". Idolator's writer Robbie Daw had a mixed opinion towards the song by writing that the recording [...] "isnâ€™t nearly as infectious as [...] "Just The Way You Are", [...] it should still make for a fairly decent album track in what weâ€™re hoping is a tasty plateful of catchy future singles". He found the tune to be [...] "reggae-tinged jam". Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "Liquor Store Blues" [...] was in a [...] "heavier dub zone with toaster Damian Marley" [...] furthering a personal matter [...] "the young singer should have stuck to the liquor store 'cause he was busted for cocaine in Vegas last month". Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine criticized the artist, saying [...] "After conquering the ladies who love weak pop music that is sung by a competent if boring singer, Bruno Mars has decided to try to carve off a chunk of Sublime's fans". He concluded by deeming the recording a [...] "faux reggae track". A writer for Rap-Up magazine commented that the recording's lyrics regard [...] "a quick escape from his bad fortune <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> foreshadowing of events". Similarly, while reviewing the music video, Entertainment Weeklys, Brad Wete stated that the content of the lyrics saying [...] "Mars aims to [...] "get messed up today" [...] in hopes that heâ€™ll [...] "be okay tomorrow"".|$|E
