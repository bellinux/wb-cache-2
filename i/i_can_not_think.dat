60|$|After the {{recognition}} and definition, then, of the infimæ species, {{the next step}} is to arrange those infimæ species into larger groups: making these groups correspond to Kinds wherever it is possible, but in most cases without any such guidance. And in doing this it is true that we are naturally and properly guided, in most cases at least, by resemblance to a type. We form our groups round certain selected Kinds, each of which serves as a sort of exemplar of its group. But though the groups are suggested by types, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that a group when formed is determined by the type; that in deciding whether a species belongs to the group, a reference is made to the type, and not to the characters; that the characters “can not be expressed in words.” This assertion is inconsistent with Dr. Whewell’s own statement of the fundamental principle of classification, namely, that “general assertions shall be possible.” If the class did not possess any characters in common, what general assertions would be possible respecting it? Except that they all resemble each other more than they resemble any thing else, nothing whatever could be predicated of the class.|$|E

Among the {{remaining}} forms of erroneous generalization, {{several of those}} most worthy of and most requiring notice have fallen under our examination in former places, where, in investigating the rules of correct induction, we have had occasion to advert to the distinction between it and some common mode of the incorrect. In this number is what I have formerly called the natural Induction of uninquiring minds, the induction of the ancients, which proceeds per enumerationem simplicem: “This, that, and the other A are B, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any A which is not B, therefore every A is B.” As a final condemnation of this rude and slovenly mode of generalization, I will quote Bacon’s emphatic denunciation of it; the most important part, as I have more than once ventured to assert, of the permanent service rendered by him to philosophy. “Inductio quæ procedit per enumerationem simplicem, res puerilis est, et precario concludit” (concludes only by your leave, or provisionally), “et periculo exponitur ab instantiâ contradictoriâ, et plerumque secundum pauciora quam par est, et ex his tantummodo quæ præsto sunt pronunciat. At Inductio quæ ad inventionem et demonstrationem Scientiarum et Artium erit utilis, Naturam separare debet, per rejectiones et exclusiones debitas; ac deinde post negativas tot quot sufficiunt, super affirmativas concludere.” ...|$|E
60|$|That {{there should}} be, in every polity, a centre of {{resistance}} to the predominant power in the Constitution--and in a democratic constitution, therefore, a nucleus {{of resistance to the}} democracy--I have already maintained; and I regard it as a fundamental maxim of government. If any people who possess a democratic representation are, from their historical antecedents, more willing to tolerate such a {{centre of resistance}} {{in the form of a}} Second Chamber or House of Lords than in any other shape, this constitutes a stronger reason for having it in that shape. But it does not appear to me the best shape in itself, nor by any means the most efficacious for its object. If there are two houses, one considered to represent the people, the other to represent only a class, or not to be representative at all, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that, where democracy is the ruling power in society, the second House would have any real ability to resist even the aberrations of the first. It might be suffered to exist in deference to habit and association, but not as an effective check. If it exercised an independent will, it would be required to do so in the same general spirit as the other House; to be equally democratic with it, and to content itself with correcting the accidental oversights of the more popular branch of the Legislature, or competing with it in popular measures.|$|E
6000|$|... 114 The assertion, {{that any}} {{and every one}} of the {{conditions}} of a [...] phenomenon may be and is, on some occasions and for some purposes, [...] spoken of as the cause, has been disputed by an intelligent reviewer [...] of this work in the Prospective Review (the predecessor of the [...] justly esteemed National Review), who maintains that “we always [...] apply the word cause rather to that element in the antecedents which [...] exercises force, and which would tend at all times to produce [...] the same or a similar effect to that which, under certain [...] conditions, it would actually produce.” And he says, that “every one [...] would feel” the expression, that the cause of a surprise was the [...] sentinel’s being off his post, to be incorrect; but that the [...] “allurement or force which drew him off his post, might be so [...] called, because in doing so it removed a resisting power which would [...] have prevented the surprise.” <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that it would be wrong [...] to say, that the event took place because the sentinel was absent, [...] and yet right to say that it took place because he was bribed to be [...] absent. Since the only direct effect of the bribe was his absence, [...] the bribe could be called the remote cause of the surprise, only on [...] the supposition that the absence was the proximate cause; nor does [...] it seem to me that any one (who had not a theory to support) would [...] use the one expression and reject the other.|$|E

6000|$|... "Even in this I do not agree. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{that even}} if the people were fit for, and had {{obtained}} universal suffrage, the ballot would be desirable. First, because it could not, in such circumstances, be supposed to be needful. Let us only conceive the state of things which the hypothesis implies: a people universally educated, and every grown-up human being possessed of a vote. If, even when only a small proportion are electors, and {{the majority of the population}} almost uneducated, public opinion is already, as every one now sees that it is, the ruling power in the last resort, it is a chimera to suppose that over a community who all read, and who all have votes, any power could be exercised by landlords and rich people against their own inclination, which it would be at all difficult for them to throw off. But, though the protection of secrecy would then be needless, the control of publicity would be as needful as ever. The universal observation of mankind has been very fallacious, if the mere fact of being one of the community, and not being in a position of pronounced contrariety of interest to the public at large, is enough to insure the performance of a public duty, without either the stimulus or the restraint derived from the opinion of our fellow-creatures. A man's own particular share of the public interest, even though he may have no private interest drawing him in the opposite direction, is not, as a general rule, found sufficient to make him do his duty to the public without other external inducements. Neither can it be admitted that, even if all had votes, they would give their votes as honestly in secret as in public.|$|E
6000|$|The {{objection}} I have to {{this language}} {{is that it}} confounds, or at [...] least confuses, a much more important distinction than that which it [...] draws. The only reason for dividing Propositions into real and [...] verbal, is in order to discriminate propositions which convey [...] information about facts, from those which do not. A proposition [...] which affirms that an object has a given attribute, while [...] designating the object by a name which already signifies the [...] attribute, adds no information to that which was already possessed [...] by all who understood the name. But when this is said, it is implied [...] that, by the signification of a name, is meant the signification [...] attached {{to it in the}} common usage of life. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> we ought [...] to say that the meaning of a word includes matters of fact which are [...] unknown to every person who uses the word unless he has learned them [...] by special study of a particular department of Nature; or that [...] because a few persons are aware of these matters of fact, the [...] affirmation of them is a proposition conveying no information. I [...] hold that (special scientific connotation apart) a name means, or [...] connotes, only the properties which it is a mark of in the general [...] mind; and {{that in the case of}} any additional properties, however [...] uniformly found to accompany these, it remains possible that a thing [...] which did not possess the properties might still be thought entitled [...] to the name. Ruminant, according to Mr. Bain’s use of language, [...] connotes cloven-hoofed, since the two properties are always found [...] together, and no connection has ever been discovered between them: [...] but ruminant does not mean cloven-hoofed; and were an animal to be [...] discovered which chews the cud, but has its feet undivided, I [...] venture to say that it would still be called ruminant.|$|E
6000|$|This doctrine, {{like that}} of Mr. De Morgan {{previously}} noticed, is a [...] real addition to the syllogistic theory; and has moreover this [...] advantage over Mr. De Morgan’s “numerically definite Syllogism,” [...] that the forms it supplies are really available {{as a test of}} the [...] correctness of ratiocination; since propositions in the common form [...] may always have their predicates quantified, and so be made amenable [...] to Sir W. Hamilton’s rules. Considered, however, as a contribution [...] to the Science of Logic, that is, to the analysis of the mental [...] processes concerned in reasoning, the new doctrine appears to me, I [...] confess, not merely superfluous, but erroneous; since the form in [...] which it clothes propositions does not, like the ordinary form, [...] express what is {{in the mind of the}} speaker when he enunciates the [...] proposition. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Sir William Hamilton right in [...] maintaining that the quantity of the predicate is “always understood [...] in thought.” It is implied, but is not present to the mind of the [...] person who asserts the proposition. The quantification of the [...] predicate, instead of being a means of bringing out more clearly the [...] meaning of the proposition, actually leads the mind out of the [...] proposition, into another order of ideas. For when we say, All men [...] are mortal, we simply mean to affirm the attribute mortality of all [...] men; without thinking at all of the class mortal in the concrete, [...] or troubling ourselves about whether it contains any other beings or [...] not. It is only for some artificial purpose that we ever look at the [...] proposition in the aspect in which the predicate also is thought of [...] as a class-name, either including the subject only, or the subject [...] and something more.

Though there is a truth contained in this opinion, of which I shall presently endeavor to show the importance, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> but <b>think</b> that this truth is enunciated in too unlimited a manner, and that there is considerable scope in sociological inquiry for the direct, {{as well as for the}} inverse, Deductive Method.|$|R

6000|$|Two {{hours from}} Tabor to Nazareth--and {{as it was}} an uncommonly narrow, crooked trail, we {{necessarily}} met all the camel trains and jackass caravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place and nowhere else. The donkeys do not matter so much, {{because they are so}} small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of spirit, but a camel is not jumpable. A camel is as tall as any ordinary dwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, and sometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man. In {{this part of the country}} his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--one on each side. He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage. Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail. The camel would not turn out for a king. He stalks serenely along, bringing his cushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out forcibly by the bulky sacks. It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly exhausting to the horses. We were compelled to jump over upwards of eighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated less than sixty times by the camels. This seems like a powerful statement, but the poet has said, [...] "Things are not what they seem." [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to have a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear with its cold, flabby under-lip. A camel did this for one of the boys, who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident of the journey.|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} forms of {{indirect}} taxation which must be peremptorily excluded. (1.) Taxes on commodities, for revenue purposes, must not operate as protecting duties, but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained, whether produced in the country itself, or imported. (2.) An exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life, or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries. Such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed, the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence; and on the most favorable supposition, namely, that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax, it operates as a peculiar tax on profits, which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth.(347) What remain are taxes on luxuries. And these have some properties which strongly recommend them. In the first place, they can never, by any possibility, touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries; while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences. In the next place, they operate in some cases as a useful, and the only useful, kind of sumptuary law. A great portion of {{the expense of the}} higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred {{for the sake of the}} pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent, but from regard to opinion, and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them, as an appendage of station; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> but <b>think</b> that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation. When a thing is bought, not for its use but for its costliness, cheapness is no recommendation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{one thing}} you may be sure, {{that as soon as}} the king shows himself, and it is seen that he is in danger, there will be no hanging back, but we shall join him with what force we <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not</b> that he <b>can</b> have aid from without, for we hear that the country people have {{everywhere}} risen, and that from Winchester in the south, to Scarborough in the north, they have taken up arms, and that the nobles are everywhere shut up in their castles, so they, being cut off from each other, are in no position to gather a force that could bring aid to the king. You can tell your good father what I say, and that all depends upon the attitude of the king. If he comes to us with his knights and men we will join him; if he comes not, and we learn that he is in danger, we will do what we can, but that must depend much upon how the rebels comport themselves." ...|$|R
60|$|The philosopher {{had other}} weaknesses--but they are {{scarcely}} worthy our serious examination. For example, {{there are few}} men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> learn, did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the subject adapted to minute investigation;--nor do I. Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, {{it is not to}} be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time, his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded--but this was by no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite German studies.|$|R
