40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the potential causes {{and management of}} the clusters of diffuse lamellar keratitis(DLK) after laser corneal refractive surgery. METHODS: The study enrolled 98 eyes(53 patients) complicated with DLK after receiving laser in situ keratomileusis(LASIK), FS-LASIK or small-incision lenticule extraction(SMILE) in our center from February 10 th, 2016 to February 22 th, 2016. They were given clinical classification treatments according to corneal layer inflammatory extent and then followed up after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 d and 1 mo. RESULTS: The clusters of DLK occurred 5 times in the study period. The incidence and degree of DLK significantly decreased after changed the sterilization, surgical equipments, temperature and humidity of the operating room. There were 80 eyes(82 %) had stage 1 DLK, 11 eyes(11 %) had stage 2, 4 eyes(4 %) had stage 3 and 3 eyes(3 %) had stage 4. The incidence of DLK after FS-LASIK was 40 %(79 eyes in 42 patients), that after LASIK assistant by Hastome keratome was 45 %(10 eyes in 5 patients), that after SMILE was 20 %(9 eyes in 6 patients). After intensive treatment, as glucocorticoid treatment and flap lifting flushing, all cases recovered within 1 mo. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of DLK may be associated with the disposable item, <b>flushing</b> <b>liquor,</b> temperature and humidity of the operating room. Early diagnosis, prevention and treatment are the key of decreasing the incidence of DLK...|$|E
60|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of cases this settled the matter; but when the men were <b>flushed</b> with <b>liquor,</b> and inclined to continue the dispute, they were seized by the collar by Wilkinson's strong arm and were summarily ejected from the house. In the inner room he preserved order as strictly, but had much more difficulty in doing so among the foreign element. Here quarrels were not uncommon, and knives occasionally drawn; but Wilkinson was a powerful man and a good boxer, and a flush hit from the shoulder always settled the business.|$|R
60|$|When I came on deck the sun {{was shining}} brightly. Captain Hannock was up, and he {{appeared}} quite a different man from what he had been the day before. His face was still <b>flushed</b> from the <b>liquor</b> he had taken, but he was sober, and, consequently, much milder in his speech.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion {{for reducing the}} solid content of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) was compared using a conventional single pass reactor (SPR) and a two stage anaerobic-aerobic process. The first stage of the two stage system used an anaerobic hydraulic flush reactor (HFR) in which the solids and liquid retention times were decoupled by retention of solids within the system. The purpose of the hydraulic flush was to wash out rapidly the fermentation intermediates from the anaerobic reactor and thus prevent their accumulation; these were subsequently removed in the second stage aerobic activated sludge system, the effluent from which was then used as the <b>flush</b> <b>liquor</b> to the first stage. The hydraulic flush reactor was operated at hydraulic (liquid) retention times of 2, 3 and 4 days with solids retention times of 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 days. In all cases the total solid content in the feed was 10 % giving loading rates to the reactor in the range 3 to 21 kg total solids per m 3 day; this same loading range {{was used in the}} single pass reactor. At high loadings the SPR system showed an accumulation of volatile fatty acids, peaking at 13000 mg 1 - 1, which resulted in process failure and cessation of solids destruction. At the same process loadings the HFR system showed only a slight decline in the rate of solids destruction when using a high hydraulic flush rate...|$|R
40|$|Performance of a {{hydrolysis}} reactor {{in which}} the solids and liquid retention times were uncoupled to give enhanced solids retention and removal of hydrolysis products was evaluated for a feedstock of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). The reactor was operated both alone {{and as part of}} a two-stage process in series with an anaerobic filter. Operating with a hydraulic flush to give hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 1. 6 and 5. 3 days, and a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 days increased hydrolysis in comparison with a control reactor where HRT and SRT were equal. Overall biodegradability was low; however, with an effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) equivalent to 30 % of the substrate biochemical methane potential (BMP). When operated as part of a two-stage process using effluent from the anaerobic filter as the <b>flush</b> <b>liquor</b> the characteristics of the system changed substantially with an increase in performance to an overall methane production of 0. 22 – 0. 24 L g? 1 volatile solids (VS) added. This was achieved even when the maximum loading of 7. 5 gVS L? 1 day? 1 was applied. During acclimatization the first-stage hydrolytic reactor became methanogenic despite the short HRT, and was responsible for as much as 70 % of the overall methane production. The system could not revert to single-stage operation after acclimatization, showing the continuing importance of the anaerobic filter. The combined system was robust, and could recover from major disturbances and step increases in loading without reduction in continuous methane production, indicating some potential for larger scale application in BMW disposa...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no mistaking}} that weak, wicked face, even then <b>flushed</b> with <b>liquor!</b> Johnny had seen it too often thus. But never before as a thief's face! He gave a little gasp, and fell back upon that strange reserve of apathy and reticence in which {{children}} are apt to hide their emotions from us at such a moment. He watched impassively the two other men who followed his brother out {{to give him a}} small bag and some instructions, and then returned within their cave, while his brother walked quickly away. He watched him disappear; he did not move, for even if he had followed him he could not bear to face him in his shame. And then out of his sullen despair came a boyish idea of revenge. It was those two men who had made his brother a thief! ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped, for at {{this moment}} a man entered the shop quickly, {{shut the door behind}} him, and turned the key in the lock. It was done so quickly that Kane instinctively felt that the man had been {{loitering}} in the vicinity and had approached from the side street. A single glance at the intruder's face and figure showed him that it was the bully of whom he had just spoken. He had seen that square, brutal face once before, confronting the police in a riot, and had not forgotten it. But today, with the <b>flush</b> of <b>liquor</b> on it, it had an impatient awkwardness and confused embarrassment that he could not account for. He did not comprehend that the genuine bully is seldom deliberate of attack, and is obliged--in common with many of the combative lower animals--to lash himself into a previous fury of provocation. This probably saved him, as perhaps some instinctive feeling that he was in no immediate danger kept him cool. He remained standing quietly behind the counter. Allen glanced around carelessly, looking at the shelves.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been about four in the afternoon--at least the rain had taken off, {{and the sun was}} setting with some wintry pomp--when the current of my {{reflections}} was effectually changed by the arrival of two visitors in a gig. They were farmers of the neighbourhood, I suppose--big, burly fellows in greatcoats and top-boots, mightily <b>flushed</b> with <b>liquor</b> when they arrived, and, before they left, inimitably drunk. They stayed long in the kitchen with Burchell, drinking, shouting, singing, and keeping it up; and the sound of their merry minstrelsy kept me a kind of company. The night fell, and the shine of the fire brightened and blinked on the panelled wall. Our illuminated windows {{must have been}} visible not only from the back lane of which Fenn had spoken, but from the court where the farmer's gig awaited them. In {{the far end of the}} firelit room lay my companions, the one silent, the other clamorously noisy, the images of death and drunkenness. Little wonder if I were tempted to join in the choruses below, and sometimes could hardly refrain from laughter, and sometimes, I believe, from tears--so unmitigated was the tedium, so cruel the suspense, of this period.|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the company}} {{which came to}} visit the two {{officers}} was an old acquaintance of Harry Esmond; that gentleman of the Guards, namely, who had been so kind to Harry when Captain Westbury’s troop had been quartered at Castlewood {{more than seven years}} before. Dick the Scholar was no longer Dick the Trooper now, but Captain Steele of Lucas’s Fusiliers, and secretary to my Lord Cutts, that famous officer of King William’s, the bravest and most beloved man of the English army. The two jolly prisoners had been drinking with a party of friends (for our cellar and that of the keepers of Newgate, too, were supplied with endless hampers of burgundy and champagne that the friends of the colonels sent in); and Harry, having no wish for their drink or their conversation, being too feeble in health for the one and too sad in spirits for the other, was sitting apart in his little room, reading such books as he had, one evening, when honest Colonel Westbury, <b>flushed</b> with <b>liquor,</b> and always good-humoured {{in and out of his}} cups, came laughing into Harry’s closet, and said, “Ho, young Killjoy! here’s a friend come to see thee; he’ll pray with thee, or he’ll drink with thee; or he’ll drink and pray turn about. Dick, my Christian hero, here’s the little scholar of Castlewood.” ...|$|R
