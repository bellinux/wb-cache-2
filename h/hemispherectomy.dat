25|$|Genie's {{language}} acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and {{gave rise to}} additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period. Throughout {{the course of her}} linguistic development her language had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior {{to the end of the}} critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar. This further convinced the scientists that Genie's {{language acquisition}} was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere of her brain.|$|E
25|$|Linguists also {{administered}} several brain exams specifically geared towards measuring Genie's language comprehension. On {{one such}} test {{she had no}} difficulty giving the correct meaning of sentences containing familiar homophones, demonstrating that her receptive comprehension was significantly better than her expressive language. Genie also did very well at identifying rhymes, both tasks that adult split-brain and left <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients had previously been recorded performing well on. During these tests an EEG consistently picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere of her brain than from those over the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area, and found especially high involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex, lending further support to the researchers' conclusion that Genie was using her right hemisphere to acquire language.|$|E
50|$|Along with neuroplasticity, {{people who}} undergo <b>hemispherectomies</b> remarkably recover due to resilience. Resilience is the ability, in this case, {{of the brain}} being able to recover from a tough {{situation}} and take back its shape. Neuroplasticity resilience explains why the hemisphere that is still intact is able to recover many of the functions that were once the removed hemisphere's job. Resilience here is an action in patients with <b>hemispherectomies</b> in which they recover and navigate back to health.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{dramatic}} alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that <b>hemispherectomies</b> pose, there are criteria that must be met {{in order for a}} person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the categories of}} neural plasticity and {{the genesis of the}} neural representation for language in population of 43 pediatric <b>hemispherectomies.</b> We have chosen to correlate language outcomes with the stages of neuronal plasticity rather than age at insult because of the unavoidable confound between the latter and etiology (Curtiss and de Bode, submitted). We argue that by examining the neural substrate for language and language outcomes posthemispherectomy, it is possible a) to investigate the progression of neural representation from pluripotential and distributed to localized and specialized and b) to accurately predict language outcomes...|$|R
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{administered a}} series of neurolinguistics tests on Genie, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed brain examinations. Based on tests and observations in everyday situations, doctors concluded that she was right-handed and that her brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant for all functions. On tests specifically measuring Genie's language, her results were congruous with adult split-brain and left <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients. On a tachistoscopic test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which rhyme. Genie also did very well on one evoked response test involving familiar homophones, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension. An EEG consistently picked up more activity from her right hemisphere than they did from the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area in a right-handed person, especially finding {{a high level of}} involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a <b>hemispherectomy</b> as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis: Seizure {{disorder}} with filamin-positive cytoplasmic astrocytic inclusions (“astrocytopathy ” or “filaminopathy”). Comment: Many of the specimens were lobectomies, {{rather than}} <b>hemispherectomies.</b> There were eosinophilic inclusions in the astrocytes, {{and these were}} negative with various stains, including Von Kossa and Ziehl-Neelsen. The inclusions were also negative for alpha-B crystallin, ubiquitin and GFAP, although the cells containing the crystals were GFAP-positive. The inclusions were granular on electron microscopy. Dr. Hedley-Whyte reported that she had presented a similar case in 1989, Diagnostic Slide Session Case 1989 - 2, which she had termed glial cytopathy or astrocytopathy, with an appearance similar to Rosenthal fibers. The Presenter reported that these inclusions were positive for filamin A, allowing the term “filaminopathy ” {{to be used for}} them. Similar inclusions can also be seen in Aicardi syndrome. Dr. Kleinschmidt-DeMasters reported that she had attended a meeting of the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists where one of these cases was presented, and it reminded her of cases that she had seen. She initiated the collaboration, and she stated that this disorder may be more common than generally recognized and that the clinical and pathologic spectrum of this disorder needs to be further characterized.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Epilepsy surgery {{has proved}} to be a {{successful}} intervention method to achieve freedom from seizures or seizure relief in children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Long term studies on operated children suggest that behavioural disorders, which are often seen before surgery, improve after surgery. However, the early postoperative development of behavioural problems has not been systematically evaluated.  METHODS—Parents of 28 children with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies completed the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. Surgeries comprised 24 focal resections (13 temporal, 11 extratemporal), two <b>hemispherectomies,</b> and two callosotomies. Twenty eight conservatively treated children with comparable CBCL scores served as a control group. A repeated measurement multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a regression analysis were computed to compare the development of behaviour between both groups and to identify predictors of postoperative changes in behaviour.  RESULTS—Preoperatively 39 % of the children exhibited significant behavioural problems, a further 11 % were within the borderline range. The MANOVA disclosed a significant interaction between time of examination and group (F= 2. 23, p< 0. 05). The surgery group showed significant improvements on the scales "internalising problems", "externalising problems", "attention problems", and "thought problems". Behavioural problems in the control group, however, remained unchanged. No changes were seen in social problems in both groups. The significant predictor of total behavioural improvement was a good seizure outcome (R 2 = 0. 11, p< 0. 05). Age, sex, onset, and duration of epilepsy, the site of the focus, and changes in antiepileptic drug regimen did not influence changes in behaviour.  CONCLUSIONS—The data demonstrate an early improvement of behavioural problems after epilepsy surgery in children. The behavioural improvements can be assumed to result directly from the removal of the epileptic focus. They are not predictable on the basis of information available preoperatively, but depend on the seizure outcome. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRationaleEpilepsy surgery {{procedures}} {{started in}} Argentina more than 50 years ago. This {{is the first}} comprehensive and systematic survey of epilepsy surgery long-term outcome from our country. MethodsA descriptive cohort study was conducted between 1998 and 2008 for drug-resistant epilepsy surgery {{with a minimum of}} 12 months follow-up (n= 110). In 84 cases (76. 36 %) resective surgery was performed, and outcome periodically assessed using the Engel score. Patients were stratified into groups: 12, 13 – 36, 37 – 60 and over than 60 months of follow-up. Video-EEG with and without intracranial electrode implants, intraoperative electrocorticograms, Wada tests, pathology reports, use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and surgical complication rates were evaluated. ResultsSurgical techniques included: 69 lobectomies (62. 7 %), 15 lesionectomies (13. 6 %), 6 callosotomies (5. 4 %), 6 multiple subpial transection (5. 4 %), 11 vagus nerve stimulations (10 %), 3 <b>hemispherectomies</b> (2. 7 %). Male: female ratio: 1 / 1. 44. Mean age at time of surgery: 26. 2 years. Mean duration of epilepsy: 14 years. Age at seizure onset: 11. 5 years. Mean follow-up: 46 months. Pathology findings: mesial temporal sclerosis 32 (35. 1 %); dual pathology 17 (18. 7 %); cortical dysplasia 15 (16. 4 %); non-specific inflammatory changes 11 (12. 1 %); tumors 7 (7. 7 %); other 6 (6. 8 %). Engel scores at 12 months follow-up: 72. 6 % (61) class I, 16. 6 % (14) class II and 15. 5 % (13) class III–IV; 13 – 36 months after surgery: 68. 1 % of cases were class I, 15. 9 % class II and 15. 5 % class III–IV. After 37 – 60 months, 74 % class I, 14 % class II, 14 % class III–IV. Over 60 months (n= 45) 78 % class I, 13. 5 % class II and 8. 1 % class III–IV. ConclusionConducting a successful epilepsy surgery program in a developing country is challenging. These results should encourage specialists in these countries. Long-term outcome results comparable to centres in developed countries can be achieved...|$|R
2500|$|By early 1974 the {{scientists}} estimated that Genie's grammar was congruous with a typical two {{or two and}} a half year old, although her progress remained unusually slow. Around [...] this time Curtiss found that, unlike most children but similar to adult split-brain and left <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients, she was completely unable to distinguish between active and passive voice, giving random responses to these sentences and never gaining any use of the passive voice. In these sentences Genie would often, though not always, confuse the subject and object, contrasting with her ability to process subject–verb–object sentences in other contexts and her own subject–verb–object sentences, but these reversals were only with certain pronouns and became significantly less common by January 1974. On a test between February 1974 to July 1975, Genie also showed no comprehension of the words many, most, few, or fewest.|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, Genie {{never used}} any {{automatic}} speech or interjections during conversations. Despite repeated efforts {{to teach her}} she could not start an interaction with automatic speech, and she only responded to ritual questions, such as [...] "How are you?", if someone repeatedly asked her and pushed her into doing so; [...] she then could say [...] "How are you?" [...] or [...] "I am fine", {{but it would be}} very forced. The only exception was when the person speaking to her had some additional affect, after which she usually laughed or tried to get the person to do it again. In addition, Genie never learned any profanity nor ever used other substitute swear words. These aspects of speech are typically either bilateral or originate in the right hemisphere, and split-brain and <b>hemispherectomy</b> patients normally learn them without difficulty, but linguists were unsurprised that Genie never used them. Curtiss wrote that Genie's failure to do so was because her childhood gave her no opportunity to observe conversation, where children typically learn them.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, <b>hemispherectomy</b> {{involved}} essentially removing an entire {{half of the}} brain. This procedure is known as anatomical <b>hemispherectomy.</b> Anatomical <b>hemispherectomy</b> decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, {{as there is no}} longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. A second type of <b>hemispherectomy,</b> known as functional <b>hemispherectomy,</b> has become more prevalent in recent years. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. If a functional <b>hemispherectomy</b> is chosen over an anatomical <b>hemispherectomy,</b> it is likely because it allows for less blood loss and greater chance of resilience for the patient. Additionally, functional <b>hemispherectomy</b> is less likely to cause hydrocephalus, the “excessive accumulation of (cerebrospinal) fluid in the brain,” which leads to complications from harmful pressure on brain tissues.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundSurgery is {{increasingly}} used as treatment for refractory focal epilepsy; however, few rigorous reports of long-term outcome exist. We did {{this study to}} identify long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery in adults by establishing patterns of seizure remission and relapse after surgery. MethodsWe report long-term outcome of surgery for epilepsy in 615 adults (497 anterior temporal resections, 40 temporal lesionectomies, 40 extratemporal lesionectomies, 20 extratemporal resections, 11 <b>hemispherectomies,</b> and seven palliative procedures [corpus callosotomy, subpial transection]), with prospective annual follow-up for a median of 8 years (range 1 – 19). We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate time to first seizure, and investigated patterns of seizure outcome. FindingsWe used survival methods to estimate that 52 % (95 % CI 48 – 56) of patients remained seizure free (apart from simple partial seizures [SPS]) at 5 years after surgery, and 47 % (42 – 51) at 10 years. Patients who had extratemporal resections {{were more likely to}} have seizure recurrence than were those who had anterior temporal resections (hazard ratio [HR] 2 · 0, 1 · 1 – 3 · 6; p= 0 · 02); whereas for those having lesionectomies, no difference from anterior lobe resection was recorded. Those with SPS in the first 2 years after temporal lobe surgery had a greater chance of subsequent seizures with impaired awareness than did those with no SPS (2 · 4, 1 · 5 – 3 · 9). Relapse was less likely the longer a person was seizure free and, conversely, remission was less likely the longer seizures continued. In 18 (19 %) of 93 people, late remission was associated with introduction of a previously untried antiepileptic drug. 104 of 365 (28 %) seizure-free individuals had discontinued drugs at latest follow-up. InterpretationNeurosurgical treatment is appealing for selected people with refractory focal epilepsy. Our data provide realistic expectations and indicate the scope for further improvements in presurgical assessment and surgical treatment of people with chronic epilepsy.

50|$|Ultimately, {{the chances}} of benefit and {{improvement}} to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend <b>hemispherectomy</b> in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, <b>hemispherectomy</b> likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater.

50|$|In some cases, severe {{epilepsy}} {{is treated}} with the <b>hemispherectomy,</b> a drastic surgical procedure in which part or all {{of one of the}} hemispheres of the brain is removed.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the last}} fifteen years, a few types of {{functional}} hemispherectomies have emerged. One such procedure is known as peri-insular <b>hemispherectomy.</b> Peri-insular <b>hemispherectomy</b> has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. In this procedure, the surgeon aims to disconnect (rather than remove) the hemisphere, {{in order to minimize}} long term complications. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hemispherectomy</b> is {{the removal}} or {{disabling}} {{of one of}} the hemispheres of the brain. This is a rare procedure used in some extreme cases of seizures which are unresponsive to other treatments.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 he {{obtained}} a doctor's {{degree at the}} University of Utrecht with a dissertation about <b>hemispherectomy</b> on human patients. He completed his military service as a physician within the Belgian Navy and rose {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel.|$|E
50|$|During the {{residual}} {{stage of the}} illness {{when there is no}} longer active inflammation, treatment is aimed at improving the remaining symptoms. Standard anti-epileptic drugs are usually ineffective in controlling seizures, and {{it may be necessary to}} surgically remove or disconnect the affected cerebral hemisphere, in an operation called <b>hemispherectomy.</b> This usually results in further weakness, hemianopsia and cognitive problems, but the other side of the brain may be able to take over some of the function, particularly in young children. The operation may not be advisable if the left hemisphere is affected, since this hemisphere contains most of the parts of the brain that control language. However, <b>hemispherectomy</b> is often very effective in reducing seizures.|$|E
50|$|In {{eligible}} symptomatic patients, {{who can be}} {{validated by}} brain imaging techniques, curative surgery could remove seizures sources. Depending on the source size, surgery will be a resection (removal of small brain areas), disconnection (larger areas) and in somes case <b>hemispherectomy</b> (a full hemisphere disconnection or removal).|$|E
50|$|This {{procedure}} {{is a modern}} adaptation of the radical <b>hemispherectomy</b> in which one brain hemisphere is removed {{to prevent the spread}} of seizures from one brain hemisphere to the other. In the functional version only a part of the hemisphere is removed but the connections to the other brain hemisphere are cut through. This {{procedure is}} only performed on a small group of patients under the age of 13 that have severe damage or malformation of one hemisphere, patients with Sturge Weber syndrome or patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis. The functional <b>hemispherectomy</b> can achieve long-term seizure freedom in over 80% of patients however often at the price of hemiplegia and hemianopsy. The death rate is around 1 to 2% and 5% of patients develop a hydrocephalus that needs to be treated with a shunt.|$|E
50|$|While at Johns Hopkins, Carson {{figured in}} {{the revival of}} the <b>hemispherectomy,</b> a drastic {{surgical}} procedure in which part or all of one hemisphere of the brain is removed to control severe pediatric epilepsy. Encouraged by John M. Freeman, he refined the procedure in the 1980s and performed it many times.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemispherectomy</b> is a {{very rare}} neurosurgical {{procedure}} in which one cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is removed, disconnected, or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where {{the source of the}} epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. <b>Hemispherectomy</b> is reserved for the most extreme cases of this one-third in which the individual’s seizures are irresponsive to medications or other less invasive surgeries and significantly impair functioning or put the patient at risk of further complications. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85%-90% of patients. Additionally, it is also known to often markedly improve the cognitive functioning and development of the individual.|$|E
