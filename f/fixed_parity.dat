40|$|We use {{data from}} Guatemala and Honduras to {{investigate}} some {{implications of the}} Purchasing Power Parity theory over the long run. In particular, we address two questions.

We found that the <b>fixed</b> <b>parities</b> regime worked properly until the mid- 1970 s, providing some constraint on central bank behavior. However, {{the evidence suggests that}} the fixed exchange rate system was not sufficient to avoid inflation outbursts and balance of payments crises.

An examination of the record of financial reveals that many hoped for benefits have failed to materialize. International financial flows have concentrated in the rich countries, have created new systemic risks, and have led to lower rates of growth of the world economy. This has happened essentially because financial markets do not merely process the financial information necessary to secures and efficient allocation of real resources. Instead, they tend to operate in such a way that heir own “beliefs” are imposed on the real economy, becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. Moreover; the potential for instability in today´s massive capital markets induces both governments and private-sector investor in the real economy to pursue highl risk-averse strategies.
