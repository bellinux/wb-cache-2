40|$|Using {{comprehensive}} {{data from}} 286 municipalities in Sweden, {{attention is focused}} on examining the connection between tax rates and public revenues. By means of a quadratic model adjusted to control for fixed effects, an attempt is made to estimate the Laffer curve and to asses if the recent decades’ <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> has brought Sweden to the slippery slope side of the curve. The findings confirm that, during the years 1992 - 2015, the bell-shaped curve is statistically significant and the maximizing tax rate is 31. 38 percent. The study does not find any evidence of reverse causality. On the contrary, support for such a reverse relationship is found to be highly improbable. Thus, the study presents evidence that some <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in Swedish municipalities throughout the recent decades has probably caused diminishing public revenues. Provided that tax rate hikes were prompted by the intention of increasing public revenues, the implication for public policy, hence, is that many municipalities have, indeed, had counterproductive tax rate levels. A reduction could therefore lighten the tax burden on the productive part of the economy, {{and at the same time}} possibly strengthen the financial state of the government...|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{size and}} role of government depends on the deadweight burden caused by incremental transfers of funds from the private sector. The magnitude of that burden depends on the <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> required to raise incremental revenue and on the deadweight loss that results from higher tax rates. Both components depend on {{the full range of}} behavioral responses of taxpayers to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> The first part of this paper explains why the official method of revenue estimation used by the Treasury and the Congress underestimates the tax rate increases required to raise additional revenue. This is closely related to the on-going debate about the use of `dynamic' revenue estimation. The second part of the paper emphasizes that the deadweight burden caused by a tax rate increase depends not just on the response of labor force participation and average working hours but also on other dimensions of labor supply, on the forms in which compensation is paid, on the individuals' spending on tax favored (deductible or excludable) forms of consumption, and on the intertemporal allocation of consumption. Recent econometric work implies that the deadweight burden caused by incremental taxation (the marginal excess burden) may exceed one dollar per dollar of revenue raised, making the cost of incremental government spending more than two dollars for each dollar of government spending. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} {{increases}} in government spending stimulate private activity. The {{first part of}} the paper studies private spending. Using a variety of identification methods and samples, I find that in most cases private spending falls significantly in response to an increase in government spending. These results imply that the average GDP multiplier lies below unity. In order to determine whether concurrent <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> dampen the spending multiplier, I use two different methods to adjust for tax effects. Neither method suggests significant effects of current tax rate changes on the spending multiplier. In {{the second part of the}} paper, I explore the effects of government spending on labor markets. I find that increases in government spending lower unemployment. Most specifications and samples imply, however, that virtually all of the effect is through an increase in government employment, not private employment. I thus conclude that on balance government spending does not appear to stimulate private activity. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we compare the tax {{systems of the}} Czech Republic and Italy. At first we provide the major {{characteristics}} of their tax systems and then we assess {{the development of the}} tax burden, tax revenues and tax rates in both countries.

The models are designed to indicate the most important factors to determine these revenues and to explore which influences are the strongest. We address variables directly linked to the tax setting, e. g. the statutory tax rates or implicit tax rates, as well as the indicators linked to the country's performance and the economic cycle, e. g. GDP per capita, GDP growth or unemployment. As the major contribution of our work, we consider the final conclusions provided {{at the end of the}} sixth chapter.

40|$|Recently, we {{evaluated}} a fiscal consolidation {{strategy for the}} United States that would bring the government budget into balance by gradually reducing government spending relative to GDP to the ratio that prevailed prior to the crisis (Cogan et al, JEDC 2013).

Contrary to the views voiced by critics of fiscal consolidation, we show that such a reduction in government purchases and transfer payments can increase GDP immediately and permanently relative to a policy without spending restraint. Our research makes use of a modern structural model of the economy that incorporates the long-standing essential features of economics: opportunity costs, efficiency, foresight and incentives.

The earnings distribution of workers around the current taxable maximum is inconsistent with an annual model {{in which people are}} highly responsive to the payroll tax rate, even in the subset of self-employed individuals. Panel data on married men with high earnings display a tremendous increase in earnings over the 1980 s and 1990 s relative to other groups, with no clear breaks around the key tax reforms. This suggests that other income groups cannot serve as a control group for the high earners. Our analysis does not support the finding of a large behavioral response to taxation by wives of high earners. We actually find a decrease in the labor supply of wives of high earners around both the 1986 and the 1993 tax reforms, which we attribute to an income effect due to the surge in primary earnings at the top. Policy simulations suggest that with an earnings elasticity of 0. 5, lost income tax revenue and increased deadweight loss would swamp any benefits from the increase in payroll tax revenue.

40|$|With {{health care}} {{delivery}} increasingly shaped by market and budgetary discipline, the provision of adequate {{health care for all}} seems an ever-more-distant goal. The forces making for that outcome are hard to mistake. First, hospitals face unprecedented financial stress arising from the cost constraints private and public payers have succeeded in enforcing, with the result that uncompensated care cross subsidies, which have acted as a safety net for the uninsured poor, have been put at risk. Second, the cross subsidies from the healthy to the sick in the individual and small-group insurance market – another safety net – have all but disappeared, and underwriting (the process of dividing the market into risk categories) has become so aggressive that it is destroying the market for health insurance for those not covered in a large-group plan at work or by Medicare or Medicaid. Third, Medicare and Medicaid themselves face significant new resource constraints; even now Medicaid provides for only half of the population below the federal poverty line. As for Medicare, the coming imbalance between the workforce and the beneficiary population points to cutbacks in real services and to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, employment-based health insurance has become much less common than {{it was only a few}} years ago.
