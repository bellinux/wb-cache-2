50|$|There are {{conflicting}} results {{regarding the}} effect of the oncogene on the differentiation of HSCs into the erythroid lineage. One study observed that the oncogene had a detrimental effect on the differentiation of HSCs, especially in the erythroid lineage, as proerythroblast colonies derived in vitro from mutated HSCs were fewer in number when compared to those derived from control HSCs, regardless of growth factors such as erythropoietin and interleukins which were introduced into the cultures. However, another study noted that the erythroid colonies were twice as populated in cultures of oncogene HSCs when compared to control HSCs. It is possible that these differing observations are due to a <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> of HSCs affected by the oncogene. The study which observed an increase in erythroid cell number noted that this proliferative effect could only be observed after around 3 weeks, and before this, cell numbers were comparable if not lower for the oncogene culture. The study observing a decreased number of cells did not quote the time of measurement, so if it was within three weeks of the culture, the reduced number may be attributed to this delay.|$|E

40|$|Widespread {{increase}} in product variety and the simultaneous emphasis on shorter order-delivery times, and lower costs, is forcing manufacturing firms to consider alternatives to both make-to-stock and make-to-order modes of production. One such alternative is delayed product differentiation. It is a hybrid strategy that reconciles {{the needs of}} high variety and quick response. A common product platform is built to stock and then differentiated into different products once demand is known. In this paper, we examine {{the costs and benefits}} of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> in environments where capacity is finite, and order lead-times are stochastic and load-dependent. We show that the advantage of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> is affected by factors such as capacity utilization, product variety, and order delay requirement. In particular, the desirability of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> is found to be sensitive to the utilization of the production system; its benefits diminishing with increasing utilization. In situations where order-delay requirements are tight, we show that delaying differentiation can be more expensive than producing in a make-to-stock fashion. However, when utilization is in the mid-range, the benefits of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> can be significant. As intuition suggests, the benefits of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> are also significant when product variety is high. In fact, the marginal benefit from <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> is, by and large, increasing in the number of products. If the point of differentiation can be affected, we find that, where feasible, differentiating early by postponing more work content until demand is realized is desirable, leading ultimately to a make-to-order system. If the cheaper early differentiation is not possible due to tight delivery requirements, we show that we should assign proportionally more capacity to the make-to-order stage...|$|E

A companion concept of <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> is also introduced. In coupling the two concepts, additive manufacturing of capabilities in-situ becomes a possibility through the equipping of operational units with three building blocks: additive manufacturing systems and their raw materials, commercial off-the-shelf items and field programmable gate arrays. A concept of operations on uses of additive manufacturing was developed to illustrate the flexibility that the nexus of DPO CONOPS and <b>delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> can engender. A {{tactical unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) was used as an illustration to contextualize the concept of operations to enhance the littoral combat ship's survivability when operating in the littorals.

40|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>differentiation</b> or {{postponement}} {{is widely}} advocated to mitigate conflicts between product diversity and inventory cost savings. Manufacturers practicing postponement often suffer from severely constrained finishing capacities and noticeable finishing lead times. Therefore, inventories are still needed for finished products. Using {{the concept of}} inventory shortfall, this paper studies base-stock inventory models with and without demand forecasting and provides a computationally efficient method to set optimal inventory targets for finished products under capacitated postponement. Computations show inventory-saving benefit quickly vanishes after the capacity reaches a certain level. The value of forecasted advance-demand information (ADI) to postponement is justified, but can easily be overstated. Finishing capacities usually force manufacturers to build ahead according to demand forecast. When capacity limitation becomes severe, intuitions often guide producers to build to forecast even more than finishing lead times ahead. Results of this research indicate that these intuitions may be invalid and build to forecast more than finishing lead times ahead {{may not be a}} good practice. Further studies reveal that under capacitated postponement the forecasted advance-demand information is useful only when the variance of demand forecast errors is less than that of demands, and show that the optimal forecast lead time can be obtained {{in the same way as}} if the capacity is unlimited.

40|$|The {{development}} of multimedia applications and distributed data retrieval systems that facilitate {{the exchange of}} real-time data in the Internet has increased {{in the past few}} years. As a result it has become evident that different types of traffic may have certain requirements {{that need to be addressed}} when the traffic is injected into the network. Mechanisms that consider such requirements and give preferential treatment to identified flows of traffic are called Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. QoS metrics that are often used and are specific to packet level traffic characteristics are bandwidth, latency (delay), jitter and loss probability. Streaming multimedia may require guaranteed bandwidth to maintain certain quality levels while Voice over IP (VoIP) requires low delay as round-trip delays may be noticeable and degrade quality. QoS has historically been achieved mainly through differentiated forwarding, i. e. by maintaining different queues on a router level for traffic of different needs. There has also been research on differentiated routing, i. e. routing traffic with different needs through different paths. This is achieved mostly by using MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS). In this thesis we present a QoS mechanism, Intra-Domain Differentiated Routing (IDDR), that provides qualitative <b>delay</b> <b>differentiation</b> in plain IP networks. We first show that we can get substantial <b>delay</b> <b>differentiation,</b> around 30 % on average, between two traffic classes within a network whilst retaining in many cases the throughput of successfully delivered flows. We can further double the <b>delay</b> <b>differentiation</b> with a minimal drop on throughput by optimising link weights using a genetic algorithm. The work is validated by simulation on multiple topologies and against many different traffic matrices to increase robustness. We then show that the IDDR can be modified and adapted for inter-domain <b>delay</b> <b>differentiation.</b> To test the inter-domain variant of IDDR we need a valid AS-level topology. Therefore, another contribution of the thesis is the AS-level topology generation that retains the properties of the internet. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
