5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations.

If the Albanian flag <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations.

5|$|After helping {{oversee the}} {{repatriation}} of soldiers back to Australia, Leane {{returned home to}} South Australia in late 1919. In May the following year he {{was selected as the}} next Commissioner of the South Australia Police, taking up the appointment in July. His appointment was initially controversial within the force, as there had been an established practice of selecting the commissioner from within its ranks. Leane also returned to part-time soldiering, commanding at the brigade level until 1926, not without controversy. His administration of the police force was generally praised, although he <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> weather several storms, one of which involved a royal commission into bribery of some of his officers by bookmakers. He was a foundation member and inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. In 1928, during a major dispute over the industrial award applying to waterfront labourers, Leane provided police protection to non-union workers, and on one occasion personally led a force of 150 police that successfully confronted a crowd of 2,000 waterside labourers who wanted to remove non-union workers from Adelaide ports. As commissioner, he introduced a number of innovations, including cadets and probationary training for young recruits, police dogs, and traffic accident analysis. After the outbreak of World War II, despite being on the retired list, Leane became the state commander of the Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps, a form of home guard, in addition to his duties as commissioner. After retiring in 1944, he was knighted for his services during 24 years {{at the head of the}} police force. In retirement he became involved in conservative politics, and remained active with returned servicemen's associations until his death in 1962.|$|E

As a result, the maximum number of points any football club/driver could score in one round during 2008 or 2009 was 100, by winning both main races. This feat wasn't achieved although Sébastien Bourdais, Craig Dolby, Robert Doornbos and Max Wissel all scored 90 points in a weekend by finishing either 2nd and 2nd or 1st and 3rd.|$|E

Fabiański left with 78 appearances and 25 clean sheets for Arsenal, as well as a winner's medal on his final appearance for the club. The 2014 FA Cup Final also turned out to be the final appearance for Bacary Sagna for Arsenal, as he agreed to join Manchester City upon the completion of his contract. Sagna had an illustrious seven-year period with the club, making 284 appearances for club with the Frenchman becoming an integral part of the Arsenal defence following his transfer from Auxerre. Unfortunately, Sagna <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> respond to distaste from some club supporters over the nature of his move to a Premier League rival, citing the move on the need to boost his career as a player, as opposed to the monetary incentives claimed.|$|E

The production crew considered having Oyelowo wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from any possible glass shards, but they later chose against it. There were scenes where some of the characters snorted cocaine. The [...] "cocaine" [...] was in actuality glucose powder that the actors <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> snort.

The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is a difficult thing to do. Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport.

One decision the new King <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign Sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest was heir presumptive to his niece until the birth of Queen Victoria's daughter, also named Victoria, in November 1840.

500|$|In {{writing the}} pilot episode, series creator Eric Kripke made several {{dramatic}} revisions to John's storyline.

Another revision had John dying {{at the end of}} the episode instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. Though he survives in the final version of the pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season that John <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die, as they believed his separation from his sons [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing."

500|$|In {{the summer}} four clubs chased Swan's {{signature}} in Sunderland, Bristol City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Port Vale. Eddie Gray was now working Swan's agent, and he arranged a £300,000 move to John Rudge's Port Vale in August 1991, with a £52,500 signing on bonus for Swan {{in addition to}} his £650 a week wages and complimentary new car. Swan later revealed in his autobiography that he only passed his medical by concealing all evidence of the cruciate injury to his right knee. Rudge played Swan almost exclusively as a defender, and never had significant problems with his knee, but <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> issue many fines and 'bollockings' for the many practical jokes Swan would carry out. After recovering from a foot injury, Rudge played Swan in attack in an FA Cup tie with Liverpool at Anfield, and Swan set up Martin Foyle for the [...] "Valiants" [...] equalising goal – despite his 'cross' being a miscued shot. The foot injury then {{turned out to be a}} stress fracture, and Swan was sidelined until Christmas. At the end of the season Vale were relegated into the third tier, and Swan was sent off for dissent in the defeat to Cambridge United that confirmed the club's relegation. He added to his inevitable fine from the club by continuing his verbal attack on the referee after the game, and following an investigation by the FA he continued to land himself in hot water with an elaborate practical joke he played on the FA officials who came to speak to Rudge at Vale Park.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E
