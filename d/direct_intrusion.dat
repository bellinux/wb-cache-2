50|$|Abbas Mirza {{was born}} on in 1789 {{in the village of}} Nava in Mazandaran. He was a younger son of Fath Ali Shah, but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him. Considered the {{favorite}} son by his father, he was named governor (beylerbeyi) of the Azerbaijan region of Persia, in approximately 1798, when he was 10 years old. In 1799, the Russians marched into Tbilisi (Tiflis), two years after Agha Mohammad Khan's assassination in Shusha and his resubjugation of Georgia and the wider Caucasus. As (Eastern) Georgia was traditionally since 1555 with the Peace of Amasya under Iranian suzerainty, it was thus a <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> of Iranian territory. In 1801 Russia tried to confirm its rule in those parts of Georgia it annexed from Qajar Iran, as well as having ambitions to push even deeper into Iranian territory and thus started marching towards Iranian-ruled Dagestan and Azerbaijan, where several of the khanates switched sides. Upon the valiant resistance against Russian intrusion in the city and khanate of Ganja, known as the Battle of Ganja, Persia was now at war with Russia (Russo-Persian War (1804-13)), while Abbas Mirza was made commander of the expeditionary force of 30,000 men. His aid was eagerly solicited by both England and Napoleon, anxious to checkmate one another in the East, especially as Persia bordered a common rival, namely Imperial Russia. Preferring the friendship of France, Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's young General Kotlyarevsky, aged only twenty-nine but his new ally could give him very little assistance.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} reign of Fat′h Ali Shah, Imperial Russia {{took control of}} Georgia, a {{territory}} which Iran had ruled intermittently since 1555 with the Peace of Amasya. Georgia, led by Erekle II, had forged an alliance with Persia's rival, Russia, following the Treaty of Georgievsk. To punish his Georgian subjects, his uncle, Agha Mohammad Khan, had invaded and sacked Tblisi, seeking to reestablishing full Persian suzerainty over Georgia, in which he succeeded. Even though the Russian garrisons in the city had to retreat, Persia didn't manage to put back all of its needed garrisons over the country as Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated soon afterwards in Shusha, following with Russia's act of annexation of those priorly-Iranian ruled parts of Georgia in 1801, after many Georgian embassies and a treaty. Also, not only was Georgia annexed but also was Dagestan invaded, which had also been under Persian rule since the early Safavid era. As it {{was seen as a}} <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> into Persian territory, Fat′h Ali Shah, determined to reassert Persian hegemony over the whole region, declared war on Russia after General Pavel Tsitsianov attacked and stormed the city of Ganja, massacring many of its inhabitants and forcing many thousands to flee deeper within the Iranian domains. In 1804, Fath Ali Shah ordered the invasion of Georgia in order to regain it, under pressure from the Shia clergy, who were urging a war against Russia. The war began with notable victories for the Persians, but Russia shipped in advanced weaponry and cannons that disadvantaged the technologically inferior Qajar forces, who did not have the artillery to match. Russia continued with a major campaign against Persia; Persia asked for help from Britain on the grounds of a military agreement with that country (the military agreement was signed after the rise of Napoleon in France). However, Britain refused to help Persia claiming that the military agreement concerned a French attack not Russian.|$|E

Based on this and the previous site investigations, including the above room test results, the followings are to be mentioned: 1. The deteriorations of reinforced concrete structures in Okinawa-prefecture due to steel bar corrosion are so prevailing, their degrees so serious and their speeds so rapid, that some protective measures must be taken promptly. 2. The great majority of existing bridges in this prefecture has been injured in some degree, and {{half of them are}} deteriorated hadly. 3.

40|$|The {{intersection}} of private rights and public responsibilities {{lies at the}} heart of both environmental and property law. This article considers this intersection in the context of debates about property ownership and notions of environmental stewardship. These form the background to considering shifts in water rights law in England and Wales and the extent to which they can be said to exhibit or exemplify a shift towards stewardship. Section 27 of the Water Act 2003 is analysed as this authorises revocation or variation of an abstraction licence without compensation in order to protect waters or aquatic flora and fauna from “serious damage”. Because regulatory abstraction licensing is a modern overlay on the common law, but one which has protected many existing abstractors from restrictions on their rights, section 27 might be regarded as strongly indicative of a stewardship shift in water rights. However, I argue that greater attention needs to be paid to the wider context within which this provision operates before it can be deployed as an unambiguous pro-stewardship example. I suggest that a range of related regulatory, economic and interpretive factors are likely to lead in practice to limited <b>direct</b> legal <b>intrusion</b> on private water rights. The case of section 27 serves as a ‘bottom up’ example of a need for circumspection about whether any specific formal, doctrinal reform is likely to exemplify, or support, a shift towards stewardship in water or property law, and draws out some of the complex relations between public and private interests than characterise stewardship...|$|R

(Torres & Shugurensky, 2002, p. 450) The consequences of globalization are as yet unclear. As Eric Schmidt, former chairman of Google, noted, “The Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that human-ity doesn’t understand ” (Murray, 2007, p. 233). In much the same manner, we do not comprehend the full effects of glo-balization (which has been made possible, in reality, by Internet technologies), especially the full effects of global-ization on institutions of higher education. The shift from a national political economy to an international or global political economy has brought about shifts in funding sources; in the academic labor market, especially in the shift from tenured, full-time academic faculty to contingent and non-tenure-track faculty; in alterations in our perceptions of the faculty–student relationship (from tutor–student to shop-keeper–customer); in a restructuring of the curriculum toward increasingly international perspectives and away from a Western, European emphasis; in the restructuring of governance traditions, with a concomitant resurgence of centralization and subsequent loss of faculty power; and additionally with the metrics of quality evaluations of fac-ulty and institutional “product, ” away from teaching and the generation of basic research and toward a “culture of accountability, ” or the “audit culture ” (Strathern, 2000).

To cover the storage area with a light shield, the conventional frontside illuminated ISIS has a limited fill factor. To achieve higher sensitivity, a BSI ISIS was developed. To avoid <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> of light and migration of signal electrons to the storage area on the frontside, a cross-sectional sensor structure with thick pnpn layers was developed, and named “Tetratified structure”. By folding and looping in-pixel storage CCDs, an image signal accumulation sensor, ISAS, is proposed. The ISAS has a new function, the in-pixel signal accumulation, in addition to the ultra-high-speed imaging. To achieve much higher frame rate, a multi-collection-gate (MCG) BSI image sensor architecture is proposed. The photoreceptive area forms a honeycomb-like shape.

40|$|We {{present a}} rare {{observation}} of direct magnetic interaction between an activating filament and a coronal hole (CH). The filament was a quiescent one {{located at the}} northwest of the CH. It underwent a nonradial activation, during which filament material constantly fell and intruded into the CH. As a result, the CH was clearly destroyed by the intrusion. Brightenings appeared at the boundaries and {{in the interior of}} the CH, meanwhile, its west boundaries began to retreat and the area gradually shrank. It is noted that the CH went on shrinking {{after the end of the}} intrusion and finally disappeared entirely. Following the filament activation, three coronal dimmings (D 1 -D 3) were formed, among which D 1 and D 2 persisted throughout the complete disappearance of the CH. The derived coronal magnetic configuration shows that the filament was located below an extended loop system which obviously linked D 1 to D 2. By comparison with this result of extrapolation, our observations imply that the interaction between the filament and the CH involved <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> of the filament material to the CH and the disappearance of the CH might be due to interchange reconnection between the expanding loop system and the CH's open field.

40|$|Pumping {{of fluids}} {{confined}} to nanometer dimension spaces is a technically challenging yet vitally important technological application with far reaching consequences for lab-on-a-chip devices, biomimetic nanoscale reactors, nanoscale filtration devices and the like. All current pumping mechanisms require {{some sort of}} <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the nanofluidic system, and involve mechanical or electronic components. In this paper, we present the first nonequilibrium molecular dynamics results to demonstrate that non-intrusive electropumping of liquid water on the nanoscale can be performed by subtly exploiting the coupling of spin angular momentum to linear streaming momentum. A spatially uniform rotating electric field is applied to water molecules, which couples to their permanent electric dipole moments. The resulting molecular rotational momentum is converted into linear streaming momentum of the fluid. By selectively tuning the degree of hydrophobicity of the solid walls one can generate a net unidirectional flow. Our results for the linear streaming and angular velocities of the confined water are in general agreement with the extended hydrodynamical theory for this process, though also suggest refinements to the theory are required. These numerical experiments confirm that this new concept for pumping of polar nanofluids can be employed under laboratory conditions, opening up significant new technological possibilities...|$|E

Sm–Nd mineral and bulk-rock data from pegmatite and granophyre zircon samples and from wehrlites and clinopyroxenites {{of the main}} Duke Island cumulate sequence {{are consistent with the}} consanguinity of the ultramafic cumulates and the zircon-bearing feldspathic rocks, and with an Early Cretaceous igneous age for the intrusion. Wall rocks for the intrusion consist of Ordovician–Silurian amphibolite- and greenschist-grade metamorphosed plutonic, volcanic, and minor sedimentary rocks and crosscutting Late Triassic gabbro–diorite of the Alexander terrane. The Duke Island ultramafic intrusion formed as a northwest-trending elongate funnel-shaped stratiform body commensurate with extensional brittle–ductile faulting in its roof and adjacent wall rocks. Intrusion occurred in a basinal setting within the Gravina volcanic arc along the Cordilleran continental margin. During the latter phases of intrusive activity the Gravina basin began to close by regional thrust faulting, which in the Duke Island region was west-northwest <b>directed.</b> The <b>intrusion</b> may have still had local intercumulate liquid upon initiation of thrust faulting. It responded first by open folding with incipient crystal plasticity. Once completely solidified, the intrusion behaved like a large "augen" with ductile deformation concentrated along its margins and within quartzo-feldspathic and micaceous members of its wall-rock complex. Much of the intrusion's northern margin behaved as a ductile shear zone serving as a tear fault between thrust plates to the northeast and an oblique thrust complex that roots beneath the southwest margin of the intrusion. The intrusion may thus be tectonically transported relative to its original underpinnings.

Under No Action Alternative 2, TRU wastes would not be emplaced at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) but would remain at generator/storage sites in surface or near-surface storage. Waste generated at smaller sites would be consolidated at the major generator/storage sites. Current TRU waste management practices would continue, but newly generated waste would be treated to meet the WIPP waste acceptance criteria.

The monitoring activities consist of many surveys for the measurement of water-head and physical-chemical parameters, collecting of sample for chemical and water stable isotopic analyses, and the setting up of a network of multi-parameter probes for a continuous monitoring. The monitoring network for hydrogeological and geochemical data consists of 40 wells/piezometers on 60 km 2. Eight piezometric and sampling surveys were performed for groundwater and surface water. Data on major elements and water isotopes are available for five surveys (253 samples). Vertical logs of EC and T were performed. The continuous monitoring network is formed of 13 multi-parameter probes, which hourly record water level, EC and T since August 2012. Some of these probes are located in the sandy unconfined aquifer, in order to verify possible water connections with the confined one. All data were then compared with the meteorological data, hydrometric measurements of Arno River, and the effective amount of exploitation carried out by the main users of groundwater. In relation to the gravelly confined aquifer, the results highlight a piezometric level below the sea level in most of the area during the monitoring period (jul 2012 -jun 2013); high EC values, ranging from 5, 000 to 7, 000 μS/cm were measured in the southern portion. On the whole, the study revealed seawater intrusion in particular in the unconfined aquifer (from 50...|$|R
40|$|The Pisa plain, {{encompassing}} the Arno and Serchio river estuaries, {{had been}} home for human settlements since early Neolithic. During {{the last two}} centuries, urban and industrial growth increased the water demand, while industrialization and intensive agriculture caused significant and invasive water pollution, reducing the availability of freshwater. Mechanical reclamation of coastal wetlands and uncontrolled pumping of wells near the coastline have in addition produced Seawater intrusion to the unconfined aquifer. Knowledge and government of water resource should certainly be a public main task: the present work {{is part of a}} Pisa Municipality wider project to preserve the unconfined coastal aquifer from Seawater intrusion and other degradations. 3 D finite-differences numerical models were applied to the coastal unconfined aquifer, also zooming to the tourist villages of Marina di Pisa and Tirrenia. A numerical flow model of the area between the Arno River to the North, Navicelli Canal to the East, Scolmatore Canal to the South and Ligurian Sea to the West, was implemented and calibrated (Wide Area Model - WAM) to provide boundary condition for the two local models of Marina di Pisa and Tirrenia. Hydrostratigraphy, rainfall pattern, thermometry, water table trend, salinity and hydraulic parameters, head of surface water bodies of the unconfined aquifer are needed for numerical model implementation. Monthly water table and salinity surveys (from October 2007 to December 2009) together with acquisition, systematization and processing of bibliographic and new on-site data were carried out to improve a conceptual model, then translated into a constant density, large-scale numerical model of the WAM. On the contrary, Marina di Pisa and Tirrenia areas were implemented as variable-density models. All three models were calibrated and sensitivity parameters identified. The local models outputs show a modest degree of <b>direct</b> marine <b>intrusion</b> near the shoreline. In the dune area to the West of Marina di Pisa, the Seawater intrusion is reduced to a thin lamina below a thick freshwater saturated layer. Near Tirrenia, the unconfined aquifer is completely salty, showing high to very high salinity in the retrodune lagoons areas to the West. This work is an exportable methodological example of numerical technique of Seawater intrusion study suited for a quantitative anticipatory evaluation of the possible counteractions...|$|R
40|$|Techniques of Direct Action: Miao-Yao Variations in Shamanic Healing by Jacques Lemoine Shamanism {{among the}} Miao-Yao group, here {{represented}} by the Hmong and the Mien-Yao, is a healing technique, its only concern being the curing of pernicious disease. It {{is a way of}} communication with the unseen part of the phenomenal world by <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> of the shaman through trance. The trance of the shaman operates as a signal of the arrival of his spirit helpers. From then on part of his self has entered the unseen world, but as a blind man. He is guided and informed by his spirit helpers, who execute his orders to search for devils and missing vital souls. At this point Hmong and Yao shamans show some discrepancy. For the Hmong, who wants to restore his patient's psychosomatic integrity, a thorough examination of the different individual vital souls takes him from his patient's house and close surrounding to the paths in the beyond, where some of the souls - the unstable souls- may have run away. The patient's problem has become a quadratic linear equation, and the shamans journey is a graphic spatial representation of it, the two unknowns being the identity of the runaway soul and the place or supernatural custody in which it may be found. For the Yao, who have adopted Taoist liturgy and metaphysics, the shaman's role, while still being a means of direct action on his patient's fate, is incorporated into the Taoist theological framework. According to the "bureaucratic metaphor", the shaman has to identify the guilt involved as primary or secondary cause of the disease and to reintegrate the patient into his family, where the case is solved as an episode in his family's relations with the supernatural administration.

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on solution extracted from 85 soil samples collected at a prawn aquaculture in Kerpan. These soil samples were taken at depths of about 2 m by using hand auger. Localities of samples were along several parallel lines which are perpendicular to the coast to about 20 km towards inland. Water samples were also collected from boreholes drilled at depths of 10 to 25 m for chemical analysis. Hydrochemical data of water extracted from soil samples taken from depths of 1 - 2 m show chloride concentrations ranging from 12 to 6, 500 mg/L. The wide range of ion concentrations indicates the presence of different type of water which can be classified as fresh to saline. Total dissolved solid values of the water samples also show quite a considerable range of concentrations ranging from 100 to 40, 000 mg/L representing fresh to saline type of water. This saline zone is within about 1 km from the coast if interpreted based on total dissolved solid values while the distance is much further towards inland which is 4 - 5 km based on chloride concentrations. In coastal areas, the presence of salt water {{can be associated with}} <b>direct</b> <b>intrusion</b> of sea water into the underground water system or it can be contributed from the infiltration of sea water through the rivers or canals during high tides into the coastal plain. The presence of salt water is supported by the increase in the concentration of natrium, kalium and calcium towards the sea. Based on spatial distribution map of chloride concentration, high salinity contour seems to follow the shape of the aquaculture ponds in the study area indicating some possibility of infiltration of sea water in the pond into the neighbouring areas. Water samples from boreholes drilled to depths of 10 to 25 m were taken and analysed in order to detect for any influence of sea water intrusion into the salinity of groundwater in the study area. Borehole water samples show chloride concentration ranging from 2, 030 to 13, 000 mg/L while the concentration of total dissolved solid ranges from 3, 233 to 9, 280 mg/L. The high chloride and total dissolved solid concentrations in the samples indicate the areas near the boreholes or within 1 km from the coast were contaminated due to the intrusion of sea water...|$|E
40|$|Saltwater {{intrusion}} {{in southern}} Florida poses {{a potential threat}} to the public drinking-water supply that is typically monitored using water samples and electromagnetic induction logs collected from a network of wells. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings are a complementary addition to the monitoring program because of their ease of use, low cost, and ability to fill in data gaps between wells. TEM soundings {{have been used to}} map saltwater intrusion in the Biscayne aquifer over a large part of south Florida including eastern Miami-Dade County and the Everglades. These two areas are very different with one being urban and the other undeveloped. Each poses different conditions that affect data collection and data quality. In the developed areas, finding sites large enough to make soundings is difficult. The presence of underground pipes further restricts useable locations. Electromagnetic noise, which reduces data quality, is also an issue. In the Everglades, access to field sites is difficult and working in water-covered terrain is challenging. Nonetheless, TEM soundings are an effective tool for mapping saltwater <b>intrusion.</b> <b>Direct</b> estimates of water quality can be obtained from the inverted TEM data using a formation factor determined for the Biscayne aquifer. This formation factor is remarkably constant over Miami-Dade County owing to the uniformity of the aquifer and the absence of clay. Thirty-six TEM soundings were collected in the Model Land area of southeast Miami-Dade County to aid in calibration of a helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) survey. The soundings and HEM survey revealed an area of saltwater intrusion aligned with canals and drainage ditches along U. S. Highway 1 and the Card Sound Road. These canals and ditches likely reduced freshwater levels through unregulated drainage and provided pathways for seawater to flow at least 12. 4 km inland...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Metropolitan Region of Recife (RMR) {{went through}} large changes {{of water and}} land uses over the last decades due to an {{increasing}} demographic pressure (1. 5 M of inhabitants). These evolutions gave rise to numerous environmental consequences, such as a dramatic decline of the water levels, groundwater salinization and con- tamination. This degradation of natural resources {{is linked to the}} increase of water demand that is also punctually amplified by drought periods, inducing the construction of thousands of private wells. Recife city was built on an estuarine area, at the geological limits of the two sedimentary basins of Per- nambuco (north of the city) and Paraíba (south of the city) separated by a famous shear zone (the Pernambuco lineament). Tectonic and sedimentary events involved in the genesis and evolution of these basins were mainly controlled by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean leading to the deposition of cretaceous sediments which now constitute the two main exploited aquifers, the Beberibe and Cabo aquifers. These two deep aquiferous formations are topped by the unconfined Boa Viagem aquifer of quaternary sediments. It is the most directly exposed to contamination, since it is connected to mangroves, rivers, estuaries and highly urbanized areas. Both the Beberibe and Cabo aquifers contain large clay levels and are separated by a rather continuous clayed formation which seems to play a consistent role of screen and to interfere in the hydraulic connections between the three aquifers. Previous isotopic studies have shown that recharge processes are similar in the aquifers, suggesting that exchanges may occur and may be modified or amplified by overexploitation. This very complex aquifer system is studied through more than 60 water samples, including some surface water samples from the main rivers. A methodology based on multi-isotopes fingerprinting is applied, including stable isotopes of the water molecule, strontium isotopes, boron isotopes, sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfates, together with major and trace elements. The main objectives are to better constrain (1) the recharge processes and connections between aquifers, and (2) the water quality degradation by exploring the salinization processes with <b>direct</b> seawater <b>intrusion,</b> paleo-seawater and/or recharge with salty water in the mangrove area, and also contamination due to urban activities. The first results highlighted the complexity of salinity sources and processes in the system. An important compartmentalization between aquifers and within the same aquifer units was observed with very distinct water signatures (87 Sr/ 86 Sr, d 11 B) at the same depth for wells located in the same street block. Groundwater residence time seems to indicate that some groundwaters were recharged under a colder climate, i. e 10 - 15 ky, with locally a very limited modern recharge. This point is of primary importance in terms of groundwater management of this strategic and fragile resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{coastal plain}} {{bordering}} the southern Venice Lagoon is a reclaimed lowland characterized by high subsidence rate, and ground level and water-table depth below sea level. In this agricultural region, where the surface hydrologic network is entirely artificially controlled by irrigation/drainage canals, salinization problems {{have long been}} encountered in soils and groundwaters. Here we use isotopic and geochemical tracers to improve {{our understanding of the}} origin of salinization and mineralization of the semi-confined aquifer (0 - 40 m), and the freshwater inputs to this hydrological system. Water samples have been collected at different seasons in the coastal Adriatic Sea, lagoon, rivers and irrigation canals, {{as well as in the}} semi-confined aquifer at depths between 12 and 35 m (14 boreholes), and in the first confined aquifer (three boreholes drilled between 40 and 80 m depth). Stable isotopes (δ 18 O and δD) and conductivity profiles show that <b>direct</b> saline <b>intrusion</b> from the sea or the lagoon is observed only in a restricted coastal strip, while brackish groundwaters are found over the entire topographic and piezometric depression in the centre of the study area. Fresh groundwaters are found only in the most western zone. The sharp isotopic contrast between the western and central regions suggests disconnected hydrological circulations between these two parts of the shallow aquifer. The border between these two regions also corresponds to the limits of the most strongly subsiding zone. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a four end-member mixing scheme, involving (1) marine water from the lagoon or the open sea, (2) alpine and pre-alpine regional recharge waters carried either by the main rivers Adige, Bacchiglione and Brenta (irrigation waters) or by the regional groundwater circulation, (3) local precipitation, and (4) evaporated waters infiltrated from the surface. Infiltration from the surface is also revealed by the stratification of the electrical conductivity profiles, showing that the brackish groundwaters are overlain by a shallow layer of less saline water all over the central depression. In the first confined aquifer, the groundwaters have isotopic compositions similar to the deep groundwaters of the Venetian confined aquifers (40 - 400 m depth). The isotopic data and the Br/Cl ratio show that the origin of the salinization of the phreatic aquifer can be ascribed to seawater intrusion alone, with no indication of the involvement of deep brines (identified at 450 m depth) in the process. The chemical composition of the saline and brackish groundwaters is characterized by an excess of sodium and a deficit of calcium compared to conservative mixing between fresh groundwaters and seawater. This suggests that the phreatic aquifer is progressively freshening, as a consequence of the beneficial influence of the extensive irrigation/drainage network, including raised canals acting as a hydraulic barrier along the coast. This freshening tendency may have been lasting since the reclamation in the mid-twentieth century, and has probably been accelerated by the ban on groundwater abstraction since the 1970 s...|$|R
40|$|The gravelly {{horizon of}} the Pisa plain {{multilayered}} {{system is a}} confined aquifer tapped by {{a large number of}} wells. It hosts a very important water resource for drinking, industrial and irrigable uses, but may be affected by seawater intrusion coming from the coastal area; most wells is distributed inland, anyway a significant exploitation along the coastal area is also present to supply farms and tourist services. Previous hydrogeological and geochemical investigations carried out in coastal area stated maximum percentage of seawater in gravelly aquifer of about 7 - 9 % and suggested the presence of two different mechanisms (Doveri et alii, 2010) : i) a <b>direct</b> seawater <b>intrusion</b> from the zone where the gravelly aquifer is in contact with the sea floor; ii) a mixing process between freshwater and seawater, the latter deriving from the Arno river-shallow sandy aquifer system. Basing on these results, since January 2012 a new two-year project was financed by the MSRM Regional Park. Major aims are a better definition of such phenomena and their distribution on the territory, and an assessing of the seawater intrusion trend in relation to groundwater exploitation. Eleven piezometers were realised during first semester of 2012, thus improving the measurement network, which is now made up by 40 wells/piezometers distributed on about 60 km^ 2. Comparing new and previous borehole data a general confinement of the gravelly aquifer is confirmed, excepting in the northern part where the aquifer is in contact with the superficial sandy one. Preliminary field measurement was performed in June 2012, during which water level (WL) and electrical conductivity (EC) data were collected. WLs below the sea-level were observed on most of the studied area, with a minimum value of about - 5 m a. s. l. in the inner part of the northern zone, where major exploitation is present. Moreover, a relative minimum of WL (about - 2 m a. s. l.) is present near the shoreline in the southern zone. In the latter EC is diffusely high from shoreline up to 5 km apart and reaches a maximum value of about 7, 000 μS/cm. Toward North a general EC decreasing is observed and values below 2, 000 μS/cm are measured in most of water-wells. On a limited area close to the Arno River, values higher than 3, 000 μS/cm are nevertheless present. Hydraulic conductivity values between E- 03 and E- 05 m/s were achieved by means of some slug and pumping tests performed on new piezometers. During this month other hydraulic tests will be performed, and monitoring of EC, T and WL will be started using automatic probes; at the same time, the pumping rates of major farms wells will be monitored. Furthermore, a water sampling field will be carried out in the next month, and the collected samples will be analysed in chemical elements and water isotopes. Thus, a first picture of the seawater intrusion and its causes will be available. References Doveri M., Giannecchini R. & Butteri M., 2010.
