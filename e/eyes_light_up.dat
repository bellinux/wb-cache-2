2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E

60|$|MARCHBANKS (the eager {{expression}} vanishing utterly {{from his}} lips and nostrils as his <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> with pathetic spirituality). Oh, now I can't say anything: all the words I know belong to some attitude or other--all except one.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she kept}} 'em to cover jam-pots with, {{and she said}} you were either a fool or a genus. Is a genus very bad, Nat?" [...] added Ruth, relenting as she saw his dreamy <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> with what she fancied was a spark of anger.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young lady}} {{gave a little}} shy laugh which made her sweet oval glowing face and soft brown <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> charmingly, {{and there was a}} fresh graceful {{roundness}} of outline about her tall slender figure, as she stood holding the shy child, which made her a wondrously pleasant sight. [...] "Are you staying here?" [...] he asked.|$|E

She always spends a longer time over her toilet, when we expect him home to dinner," [...] she added, with a touch of naïve femininity. [...] "But--if it be love, then that love is strange and unwomanly; it is a love that will not be for his good ..." ...|$|E
60|$|They walked {{together}} back to Westminster {{and wished}} {{each other a}} short good-night upon what once had been their common doorstep. With her latchkey in her hand, she turned and watched his retreating figure, and suddenly a wave of longing seized her to run after him and call him back--to see his <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> and feel the pressure of his hands. It was only by clinging to the railings and counting till she was sure he had entered his own house round the corner {{and closed the door}} behind him, that she restrained herself.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} excited because these men {{attended}} {{to her when}} she came near. She could make their <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> and quiver, she could make Anthony, the eldest, twist and twist his moustache. She knew she could move them almost at will with her light laughter and chatter. They loved her ideas, watched her as she talked vehemently about politics or economics. And she, while she talked, saw the golden-brown eyes of Anthony gleam like the eyes of a satyr as they watched her. He did not listen to her words, he listened to her. It excited her.|$|E

6000|$|Half the {{pigtails}} {{have fled}} into the darkness, but the remainder assured and trebly assured that the Police really mean [...] "no pidgin," [...] return {{to the table and}} stand round while the croupier manipulates the cowries, the little curved slip of bamboo, and the soup-bowl. They never gamble, these innocents. They only come to look on, and smoke opium in the next room. Yet as the game progresses their <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up,</b> and one by one put their money on odd or even--the number of the cowries that are covered and left uncovered by the little soup-bowl. Mythan {{is the name of the}} amusement, and, whatever may be its demerits, it is clean. The Police look on while their charge plays and loots a parchment-skinned horror--one of Swift's Struldburgs, strayed from Laputa--of the enormous sum of two annas. The return of this wealth, doubled, sets the loser beating his forehead against the table from sheer gratitude.|$|E
60|$|This was {{at present}} her ideal of Sunday occupation, {{and she had}} gained a little fragmentary {{experience}} under Sydney's guidance at Fordham. So {{she was in a}} most engaging glow of shy delight, and the tidy little well-trained girls who were allotted to her did not diminish her satisfaction. To say that Armine's positive enjoyment was equal to hers would not be true, but he had intended all his life to be a clergyman, and he was resolved not to shrink from his first experience of the kind. The boys were too much impressed, by the apparition of one of the young gentlemen from Belforest, to comport themselves ill, but they would probably not have answered his questions even had they been in their own language, and they stared at him in a stolid way, while he disadvantageously contrasted them with the little ready-tongued peasant boys of Italy. However, he had just found the touch of nature which made the world kin, and had made their <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> by telling them of a scene he had beheld in Palestine, illustrating the parable they had been repeating, when the change in the Church bells was a signal for leaving off.|$|E

6000|$|Yes! In the insolent {{presence}} of Grace Roseberry, {{what was there}} now {{that she could not}} sustain? Her pride was in arms.

Her face w armed into color; her beauty rallied its charms. Her triumph over Grace Roseberry was complete! Julian's head sank.

5000|$|Ray's biographer W.

He looks down at the grass, examines the blade and is off hopping into the bamboo grove. There the Alien sees a small plant. His <b>eyes</b> <b>light</b> <b>up</b> with a yellow light. He passes his hand over the plant, and flowers come out. A thin, soft high-pitched laugh shows the Alien is pleased." ...|$|E
5000|$|An intense youth, pale-complexioned, with a {{prominent}} forehead, {{a face like}} Shelley, lifts a glass - [...] "Death to the Tsar." [...] The toast is received with emotion.
