500|$|During {{her time}} as a model, Larter moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. In 2002, she moved to New York {{for a period of}} three years. In an {{interview}} with Phillymag, Larter gave reason for the move: [...] "I took some time off to define myself outside the pressures of the industry. Part of me really needed to know if this is what I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life." [...] In January 2005, she moved to Los Angeles for a role in Heroes.|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had absolutely nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a story in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E

I found that fascinating." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Mark 14:51-52, a {{young man}} in a linen cloth is seized during Jesus' arrest, but he escapes at the cost of his clothing. This passage seems to have little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Often it is {{suggested}} that the young man is Mark himself. Some commentators believe that the boy was a stranger, who lived near the garden and, after being awakened, ran out, half-dressed, to see what all the noise was about (vv. 46-49). W. L. Lane thinks that Mark mentioned this episode in order to make it clear that [...] "all (not only the disciples) fled, leaving Jesus alone in the custody of the police." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope {{tell you what to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{became a}} Christian {{following}} a divorce, {{and later became}} an elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Johnson recounts that on sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for what he should <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and Michael Denton's [...] (1985). Johnson later said, [...] "Something about the Darwinists' rhetorical style made me think they had something to hide." [...] Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that could add insight into the premises and arguments. [...] Johnson stated that he approaches the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily {{on the kind of}} logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make. Further, he pointed out that four of the eleven members of the special committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences to prepare its official booklet titled Science and Creationism were lawyers. Since the publication of the first edition of Darwin on Trial in 1991, he has become a prominent critic of evolutionary theory.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, the {{producers}} of a theater-in-the-round version of Peter Pan offered Rigby the title role.

60|$|SELF is that {{conscious}} thinking thing,--whatever substance made up of, (whether spiritual or material, simple or compounded, {{it matters}} not)--which is sensible or conscious {{of pleasure and}} pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, {{as far as that}} consciousness extends. Thus every one finds that, whilst comprehended under that consciousness, the little finger {{is as much a part}} of himself as what is most so. Upon separation of this little finger, should this consciousness go along with the little finger, and leave the rest of the body, it is evident the little finger would be the person, the same person; and self then would have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the body. As in this case it is the consciousness that goes along with the substance, when one part is separate from another, which makes the same person, and constitutes this inseparable self: so it is in reference to substances remote in time. That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing CAN join itself, makes the same person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to itself, and owns all the actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no further; as every one who reflects will perceive.|$|E

Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to inquire {{concerning}} Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem. And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.

Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and levites, singers, porters, nethinims, or ministers of this House of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.
