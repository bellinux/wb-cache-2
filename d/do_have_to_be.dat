After Married to the Mob, he appeared in Working Girl (1988), Flatliners (1990), Beethoven (1992), The Three Musketeers (1993), A Time to Kill (1996) and Bulworth (1998). In 1998 Platt and Stanley Tucci played two deadbeat actors who improvise with unsuspecting strangers in The Impostors. Tucci and Platt developed the characters while working on a play at Yale University in 1988, Tucci later completing the screenplay and directing the film.|$|E

Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia in 1990 {{approved of the}} non-combat activities, but criticized several aspects of the game such as the lack of experience points for unconscious players during combat. She concluded that [...] "Champions of Krynn {{is a pretty good}} game overall, but you <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of its failings". In 1993 she called the game [...] "standard fare for the most part", approving of cameo appearances of characters from the books but criticizing the final battle as [...] "wearisome rather than exciting".|$|E
50|$|These {{differences}} {{mean that}} when coupling two train sets together, the 'A' {{end of one}} set must be coupled to the 'D' end of the other. Although train sets are not normally split in day to day usage, they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> split when undergoing major maintenance tasks such as when the bodies are lifted off of the bogies. This {{is not a problem}} on most lines where all the train sets start and remain the same way around. However, on the Northern line the existence of the Kennington loop just south of Kennington station which allows Charing Cross branch trains to depart its southbound platform and arrive at its northbound platform reverses the complete train once every journey. This means that on this line, on average, half the trains will be facing the opposite direction to the remainder. Only sets facing the same way can be coupled together.|$|E

If a girl is struggling, she is called into Finglass's office to discuss the nature of her difficulty and is generally {{given an opportunity to}} correct the shortcoming(s) to avoid being dismissed (cut) from the squad. However, some girls <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cut for several reasons. Common reasons for being cut include failure to correctly perform mandatory dance routines, failure to display an elite level of dance skill, a lack of physical fitness and/or failing to meet body fat requirements, and to reduce the squad roster down to the traditional number of 36 girls. Candidates have also been cut due to past legal problems, morality issues, domestic distractions (family issues), lack of preparedness, and poor time management skills. And rookie candidates haven't been the only ones who have been cut; even veterans have been cut due to some of the above-mentioned reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Proto-Germanic long {{plosives}} are voiceless; {{but while}} long voiced plosives were rare, they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconstructed {{in a few}} cases. The hypothesis of expressive gemination has trouble explaining this, as Trautmann (1906: 66) admitted while rejecting Kluge's law: [...] "Wie wir uns freilich das Nebeneinander von z.

Kroonen (2011: 124): [...] "The only existing theory that is powerful enough such root variations, {{is the one that}} acknowledges consonant gradation and the underlying mechanism of the paradigmatic contaminations. The co-occurrence of ON riga 'to lift heavily' : MLG wriggen 'to twist' : ME wricken 'to wiggle', for instance, implies two different expressive formations within the Expressivity Theory, the choice between a voiced and voiceless geminate being arbitrary, erratic, or, in other words, scientifically unfalsifiable. By reconstructing a paradigm *wrikkōþi, *wrigunanþi < *uriḱ-néh₂-ti, *uriḱ-nh₂-énti, on the other hand, the only irregular form is *wrigg-, which can be readily explained by contamination of *wrig- and *wrikk-." ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of reminiscence which can take place. The two main subtypes are intrapersonal and interpersonal reminiscence. Intrapersonal takes a cognitive stance and occurs individually. Interpersonal takes more of a conversational side and is a group-based therapy. Reminiscence can then be further broken down into three specific types which are: information, evaluation, and obsessive. Information reminiscence is done {{to be able to}} enjoy the retelling of stories from one’s past. This type {{can also be used to}} help someone who may be lacking interest in his or her life and relationships. The ability to recall good memories can help them remember what they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy about. Evaluative reminiscence is the main type of reminiscence therapy as it is based on Dr. Robert Butler's life review. This process involves recalling memories throughout one’s entire life and sharing these stories with other people. Often this is done within group therapy. Obsessive reminiscence occurs when somebody needs to be able to let go of any stress of guilt that may be lingering. By working through these issues it allows them to be at peace with themselves. Reminiscence has also been used to help people deal with the death of a loved one. By sharing stories about the loved one's life they can remember fond memories and gain a sense of peace with the death.|$|E

40|$|Regarding marriage, John Wyclif {{defends the}} {{following}} position: strictly speaking, no words {{or any kind}} of sensory signs would be needed, since the consensus of the spouses together with God's approbation would suffice for the accomplishment of marriage. But if words <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pronounced, then the appropriate formula should not be in the present, but in the future. In the following, I shall discuss Wyclif 's arguments by comparing them with some other medieval positions, as well as with some elements of contemporary theories of speech acts. It will appear that in his analysis of the only sacrament which is a "social act" in the literal sense of the expression, Wyclif (i) clearly acknowledges the central role of individual intentions behind (linguistic) conventions, and (ii) carefully distinguishes between the different, chronologically disparate acts involved in marriage and their respective (semantic, psychological and factual) felicity conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Children are strikingly good at {{learning}} {{the meanings of}} names for things. There is considerable evidence that they solve this mapping problem through inferring the referential intentions of other people. This mindreading capacity might also underlie children’s assumptions that words do not overlap in reference, and that new words are likely to refer to whole objects. Finally, there is some support for {{the view that the}} mindreading that underlies word learning is due to a general capacity to infer mental states, not a submodule that is dedicated to communication. There are two facts about word learning that everyone accepts. The first is that words really <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned. There is controversy over how much conceptual structure and linguistic knowledge is innate, but nobody thinks that this is the case for the specific mappings between sounds (or signs) and meanings. This is because these mappings vary arbitrarily from culture to culture. No matter how intelligent a British baby is, for instance, she still has to learn, by attending to the language of the people around her, that rabbits are called ‘rabbits’, that sleeping is called ‘sleeping’, and so on...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} selected {{issues from the}} international literature on skills training into the South African policy forum. Reform of national strategies in skills production has characterised a number of industrial as well as certain developing economies in recent decades. Their experience is potentially valuable locally. The main lessons are that skills training resembles education in being partly a public good. The acquisition of skills parallels the acquisition of knowledge. Training opportunities <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rationed by some mechanism, either through the market or by rules internal to an organisation engaged in training, but {{the content of the}} competency learned is a form of knowledge. More competency with economic value that is acquired by one person does not mean less of it is available for acquisition by another. Nor, secondly, can non-payers be wholly excluded from the benefits of training financed by others. For example, there are separate gains for fellow workers, for employers poaching trained workers, and for investors in new technology. So certain economic decision-takers can free-ride on such investments in human capital. As classic examples of market failure they make clear tha...|$|E

40|$|Sense-perceptions do {{not have}} to be deciphered if their {{contents}} are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are representations, not presentations. It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations, and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions or, therefore, by linguistic entities. Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend the concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol, the result being that such attempts eviscerate the very position that it is their purpose to defend. Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. This view is demonstrably false, dooming to failure the just-mentioned attempts to defend the contention that thought is in all cases mediated by linguistic symbol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We analyse {{the recent}} wave of {{political}} instability in Bolivia {{in the context}} of a ‘poverty trap’ model which suggests that elements in a country’s political system, as well as its economic structure, may be instrumental in perpetuating a state of poverty. In Bolivia the costs of adjustment in the recent phase have been very severe, with well over a hundred killed between 1999 and 2007 as a direct consequence of demonstrations against aspects of the globalisation and adjustment process, and an appearance of a return to a state of chronic political instability; other countries affected by the global crisis have suffered less severely. Is this because they used the available instruments of adjustment more effectively, or for other reasons? In particular, how does poverty impact fit into the story: would a ‘more effective ’ pattern of adjustment have been more pro-poor? There is no doubt that some aspects of the Bolivian political economy <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken as parametric and have, over many years, played a major part in increasing the vulnerability of the political system and in predisposing it, in recent years, towards instability. These include: the collapse of conventional party politics as an instrument for representing the interests of the poor; the decay of a number of key institutions including the courts, financial institutions and standards of fiscal governance; and the unique combination, within the satellite city of El Alto, of strategic location, unemployment rising much faste...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{shall present}} and discuss some {{possible}} criteria of narrativity {{with regard to}} their applicability to pictorial objects. More specifically, I will argue that pictorial works may express or imply fictional narrative structures. First, as I would like to argue, the concepts of fiction and narrativity could and should more thoroughly be investigated with regard to other media, such as pictorial ones, and second, pictorial representations may very well be considered as forms of fiction, although they might have a narrative structure or content only to a limited extent (or perhaps none at all). Throughout the history of art, artists have unquestionably been engaged in rendering (parts or aspects of) fictional worlds, fictional entities or states of affairs, and the like – that is, pictorial fictions. In a broad sense, then, fiction can also be used as referring to the representation of imaginary characters, events, places in any conceivable media, such as pictures, quite apart from any outspoken narrative structuring. Indeed, as I would claim, the relationship between fiction and (verbal) narratives is logically contingent: not every fiction is verbal, nor do even verbal fictions have to be narrative (e. g. images as well as verbal descriptions of, say, Apollo or the Garden of Eden). And not all narratives, such as historical ones, <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fictional. Recent research within cognitive psychology and narratology will be taken into account, and some concrete pictorial examples with fictional aspects will be discussed...|$|E
