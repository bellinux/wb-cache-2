40|$|In Central and Southern Italy, where {{durum wheat}} {{represents}} {{one of the most widely}} cultivated crops, grain filling occurs during Spring, a period characterised by sudden increases in temperature. Wheat grain proteins are classified into albumins, globulins, and prolamins. The non-prolamin fractions include proteins with metabolic activity or structural function. In order to investigate the consequences of heat stress on the accumulation of non-prolamin proteins in mature durum wheat kernels, the Italian cultivar Svevo was subjected to two thermal regimes (heat stress vs. control) during grain filling. The 2 D patterns of non-prolamin proteins were monitored to identify polypeptides affected by heat stress. This study shows that heat stress alters significantly the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seed</b> proteome, although the fold changes range only between 1. 2 and 2. 2. This analysis revealed 132 differentially expressed polypeptides, 47 of which were identified by MALDI TOF and MALDI-TOF-TOF MS and included heat shock proteins, proteins involved in the glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as stress related proteins. Many of the heat induced polypeptides are considered to be allergenic for sensitive individuals. The differences observed with previously reported data regarding bread wheat may be explained by the absence of the D genome in durum wheatL'articolo è disponibile sul sito dell'editore: www. interscience. wiley. comProject “Proteine e geni per la protezione delle piante dagli stress biotici e abiotici (PROTEO-STRESS), MIPAF, Italy - MIUR, "Fondo per il sostegno dei giovani e per favorire la mobilità degli studenti" in the framework “Valorizzazione dei prodotti tipici dell’agroalimentare e sicurezza alimentare attraverso nuovi sistemi di caratterizzazione e garanzia di qualità” - COST Action FA 0603 Plant Proteomics...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{content of}} the wheat seed has {{significance}} for agronomy, environment and also for human health. Seeds containing higher amounts of micronutrients, especially zinc, are better at germination and show high resistance to pests. Experiments on the mechanisms of micronutrient uptake and their accumulation in the plant body and the seeds showed a correlation between zinc and protein amount in the seed, which suggested some proteins, mostly abundant in the embryo and the aleurone layer, might be sinks for zinc. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge on zinc binding proteins of wheat seed. In this project, we aimed to determine the effect of environmental conditions on the protein and micronutrient {{content of the}} <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seed</b> and to screen the proteome of the wheat seed to identify the proteins with metalin particular Zn-binding propensity. Protein analyses were carried out on seeds with extreme N and Zn content. Extraction methods available in the literature were modified to obtain reproducible profiles of the total protein content and to separate seed proteins into fractions of different storage protein classes. Extracts were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a procedure for detection of Zn-binding proteins was developed. Results showed Zn-binding by Cys rich proteins in the molecular mass range 30 to 50 kDa. The method was extensively tested to confirm the association of Zn with specific proteins, however, if those proteins bind metal in vivo remains to be shown. Microscopic analysis of in situ staining for protein and Zn localization showed preferential staining in the embryo and aleurone layers of the seed and led to determination of the protein profiles from embryo and endosperm tissues, separately. The methods developed during this and further studies, shall be used to do the same screening for different wild-type and cultivated genotypes of wheat...|$|E
40|$|Pasta {{quality has}} been shown to depend mainly on <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seed</b> storage protein composition. The main {{objective}} of this study was analyse the effect of prolamin composition in the gluten strength and viscoelasticity in the progeny of four intervarietal durum wheat crosses. The characterisation of Portuguese durum wheat collection allowed selection of parents with different quality types and protein patterns. The storage proteins of F_ 2 progenies from four crosses were analysed by electrophoresis (A-PAGE and SDS-PAGE) and identified the gliadins, high (HMW) and low (LMW) molecular weight glutenins and chromosomal location of genes. The quality of the resulting F_ 3 and F_ 4 populations was evaluated in field experiments with two replications. The quality was analysed by protein content, vitreousness, SDS sedimentation, falling number, gluten content, gluten index, mixograph and alveograph mixing properties. The crosses enabled additive effects of Glu-A 1, Glu-B 1 and Glu-B 3 for quality variation. Qualitative data have confirmed the strong relationship between Glu-B 3 locus and gluten properties, with LMW 2 + 4 + 14 + 15 + 19 making the largest positive contribution. The HMW 14 + 15 also gave positive effects mainly when compared with allelic variant HMW 20. The influence of prolamins controlled by other loci on pasta quality was insignificant. The contribution of allelic variants for quality differences showed to decrease following the order: Glu-B 3 :LMW 2 + 4 + 14 + 15 + 19 > LMW 4 +x+ 15 + 19 > LMW 2 + 4 + 15 + 19 > LMW 8 + 9 + 13 + 19 > LMW 8 + 9 + 13 + 16; Glu-B 1 : HMW 14 + 15 > HMW 6 + 8 = HMW 7 + 8 > HMW 20; Glu-A 1 : HMW 1 > HMW 2 *. The relations between the results of quality parameters showed two groups of dough characteristics: the protein "quality" defined by SDS sedimentation, mixograph mixing time and alveograph strength and protein "quantity" influenced by protein, gluten contents and mixogram peak resistance.

An in vitro experiment was conducted to observe {{the effect of the}} inoculation of four indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) -producing Pseudomonas isolatesand exogenous IAA on seed germination traits and α-amylase activity of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> The results showed inoculation with all bacterial isolates led to a decrease in the germination percent, although the extent of the depression varied with the isolate. A significant relationship between concentrations of bacterial IAA and the germination inhibition percent in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> by different bacteria strains was observed. The results of this assay showed the effect of bacterial isolates on α-amylase activity after six and 8 days of inoculation was significant, while effect of these isolates on α-amylase activity after two and 4 days of inoculation was not meaningful. In addition, the exogenously applied IAA displayed a concentration-dependent effect on seed germination attributes and α-amylase activity, consistent with the possibility that the inhibitory effect of bacterial inoculation on seed germination was in consequence of bacteria-produced IAA. Therefore, it may suggested that the inhibitory role of IAA in seed germination and α-amylase activity should be taken into account during the screening of IAA-producing Pseudomonas isolates for <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> growth promoting agents. ...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have adopted}} the use of {{magnetic}} field as a new pre-sowing, environmental friendly technique. Enhancements on plant characteristics with economic impact on producer’s income could be {{the future of a}} modern, organic and sustainable agriculture. A field experiment was established at Soil Science Institute of Athens, Lycovrissi, Greece, in the winter of 2014. Two <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars were used. It was a pot experiment with 6 treatments (2 cultivars with 3 magnetic field time exposure). The seeds were treated using a PAPIMI electromagnetic field generator for 0, 30 and 45 minutes one day before planting. The experiment followed a completely randomized design with six treatments and 30 replications. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the positive effect of magnetic field pre-sowing treatment in a wide range of plant measurements, including yield. The influence of pulsed electromagnetic field on two varieties of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> showed some statistically significant differences at the 0. 05 level in growth measurements, physiological measurements and root growth measurements. Plant tissue analysis showed that magnetic field treatments had higher values than control in total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, copper (only MF- 45), zinc (only MF- 30) and boron content, although values showed statistically significant differences only in total nitrogen. The results indicate that this innovative technique can increase the yield of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> through enhanced absorption of nutrients.

40|$|Olive-mill {{wastewater}} (OMW), an {{effluent of}} olive oil extraction process, is annually produced in huge amounts in olive growing areas. An interesting option for its disposal is the spreading on agricultural land, pro- vided that phytotoxic effects are neutralized. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential of an enzyme-based treatment in removing OMW phytotoxicity. To this aim, germinability experiments on <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum <b>durum</b> Desf. cv. Duilio) were conducted {{in the presence of}} different dilutions of raw or enzyme-treated OMW. OMWtreatment with laccase resulted in a 65 % and 86 % reduction in total phenols and ortho-diphenols respectively, due their polymerization as revealed by size-exclusion chromatography. Raw OMW exerted a significant concentration-dependent inhibition on the germinability of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> which was evident up to a dilution rate of 1 : 8. When the effluent was treated with a fungal laccase, germinability was increased by 57 % at a 1 : 8 dilution and by 94 % at a 1 : 2 dilution, as compared to the same dilutions using untreated OMW. The treatment with laccase also decreased the mean germination time by about 1 day as compared to untreated controls. These results show that germinability inhibition due to OMW can be reduced effectively using fungal laccase, suggesting that phenols are the main determinants of its phytotoxicity.

40|$|Fusarium culmorum {{is a major}} fungal {{pathogen}} of wheat, causing {{foot and}} root rot (FRR) and fusarium head blight (FHB). Symptons include pre- and post-emergence death of the seedlings. It causes significant yield and quality losses. This study shows the importance to select mutants of F. culmorum altered in their metabolic or morphological processes and impaired in level of virulence and aggressiveness during {{the first step of}} interaction between this fungus with the host plant. The function of many genes that are implicated in FRR on <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> seedilings is as yet unknown. Therefore, the characterization and identification of pathogenicity-related genes is essential in the build-up of alternative control methods against this disease. The mutants of F. culmorum were obtained by random and targeted insertional mutagenesis methods using the transposon mimp 1. The transposon insertion into a gene region allows to tag the gene of interest. In vitro bioassays to identify altered phenotypic characters of revertants growing in different metabolic conditions (osmotic stress, oxidative stress) were carried out. In vitro and in planta assays of pathogenicity were also performed by placing <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> on mycelium discs in a Petri dish or covered by steril soil.

The research reported here centres on the glutenin subunits 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 encoded by chromosome 1 D, and whose presence in hexaploid wheats is positively correlated with higher dough strength. In order to study the effects of stable expression of the 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 glutenin subunits in different <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> genotypes, four cultivars commonly grown in the Mediterranean area ('Svevo', 'Creso', 'Varano' and 'Latino') were co-transformed, via particle bombardment of cultured immature embryos, with the two wheat genes Glu-D 1 - 1 d and Glu-D 1 - 2 b encoding the glutenin subunits, and a third plasmid containing the bar gene as a selectable marker. Protein gel analyses of T(1) generation seed extracts showed expression of one or both glutenin genes in four different transformed <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> plants. One of these transgenic lines, DC 2 - 65, showed co-suppression of all HMW-GS, including the endogenous ones. Transgene stability in the transgenic lines has been studied over four generations (T(1) -T(4)). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of metaphase chromosomes from T(4) plants showed that the integration of transgenes occurred in both telomeric and centromeric regions. The three plasmids were found inserted at a single locus in two lines and in two loci on the same chromosome arm in one line. The fourth line had two transgenic loci on different chromosomes: one with both glutenin plasmids and a different one containing only the construct with the gene encoding the 1 Dy 10 glutenin subunit. Segregation of these two loci in subsequent generations allowed establishment of two sublines, one containing both 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 and the other containing only 1 Dy 10.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of the Commission's CAP mid-term review proposals to complete the shift from product support to farmer support the Italian government announced strong opposition to any cuts in aid to <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> producers. Italy currently produces 3. 5 million tonnes of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> per annum for which it receives € 345 per hectare in subsidies, a total of € 552 million per annum. The mid-term review proposals call for a reduction in the special supplementary payments for <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> from 'traditional' areas (all of Italy's durum wheat-producing areas) to € 250 per hectare over a three-year period (and its abolition in 'established areas'). The Italian Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno maintained that this was 'a fundamental issue for Italy not only because the reform will cut Italy's share of the budget, but because it could lead to a transfer of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> production, and related pasta production to other countries'. This he maintained 'would be intolerable'. Comment: The Commission maintains that reform of the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> regime is necessary since each year 1 to 2 million tonnes of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> are used in animal feed and not as an input into pasta production. A modification of the current specific supplementary payment regime is thus held to be essential. Furthermore the EU Court of Auditors has criticised the special supplementary payment system for over-compensating farmers. Italian concerns over <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and pasta production may however be addressed through modification of the proposals for special payments for high quality <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> for manufacturing purposes. This would help to ensure the ready availability of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> for pasta production. Italian pasta is increasingly appearing on supermarket shelves in southern Africa indicating that existing cereal sector reforms have already assisted in enhancing the price competitiveness of Italian pasta production on overseas markets.

40|$|<b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> {{is one of}} the {{commodities}} for which there is intense trade competition between the United States and Canada. This article examines the relationship between Canadian and U. S. <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> prices using cointegration and an asymmetric error correction approach. The overall results suggest that a long run relation holds between the U. S. and Canadian <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> prices. The U. S. price responds to restore the equilibrium relationship with the corresponding Canadian price, while the Canadian price evolves independently. Using tests for structural change it is revealed that changes in Canadian domestic policy (the repeal of the WGTA) had an effect on this long run relation. Since the withdrawal of the WGTA, quality differences in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> for both countries seem to matter in the dynamics and integration of U.

S. domestic prices of these two commodities and farm income in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley growing regions in the United States. Major factors affecting trade flows of agricultural commodities between the United States and Canada are the U. S. export enhancement program, the elimination of Canadian rail subsidies, marketing power of the Canadian Wheat Board, differences in macroeconomic conditions, and differences in resource endowments. They have influenced Canadian exports positively and resulted in major increases in Canadian exports of agricultural commodities to the United States. The increased Canadian exports reduce domestic prices of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley and consequently lowered farm income in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley growing regions in the United States.

The field trials were carried out at three locations in Serbia, as randomized complete block design with four replications. The genetic component of variance (σ 2 g) predominated the genotype × environment interaction (σ 2 ge) component for: Pi in bread wheat (3. 0 times higher), Pp/Pi in bread wheat (2. 1 times higher) and in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (1. 2 times higher), YP content in bread wheat (2. 2 times higher) and in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (1. 7 times higher), and WSPH content in bread wheat (1. 4 times higher). The relation σ 2 g/σ 2 ge for Pi content in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> was equal to one. The σ 2 ge prevailed σ 2 g for: PA in bread wheat (1. 7 times higher) and in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (5. 7 times higher), PSH in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (3. 7 times higher), and WSPH in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (5. 2 times higher). High h 2 coupled with high expected genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) were observed for: Pi (93. 7 % and 26. 1 %, respectively) in bread wheat, Pp/Pi relation in bread wheat (92. 4 % and 20. 7 %, respectively) and in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (87. 2 % and 20. 8 %, respectively), YP content in bread wheat (92. 6 % and 28. 0 %, respectively) and in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (90. 7 % and 28. 1 %, respectively), and WSPH content (88. 9 % and 25. 8 %, respectively) in bread wheat.

Results of this investigation showed that the genetic component of variance (σ 2 g) was predominant for TGW of bread and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and for GNS of bread wheat. The genotype × environment interaction (σ 2 ge) component of phenotypic variance was 8. 72 times higher than σ 2 g for GNS of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> {{and pointed to the}} greater instability of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> genotypes. h 2 was very high (> 90 %) for TGW and GNS of bread wheat, high for TGW of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> - 87. 3 % and low for GNS of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> - 39. 5 %. Considering the high values obtained for h 2 - 96. 4 % and the highest value for expected genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) - 19. 3 % for TGW of bread wheat, the success of selection for desired values of this yield component can be anticipated. The success of selection cannot be predicted for GNS of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> due to low values obtained for h 2 and GAM of 39. 5 % and 2. 8 %, respectively...|$|R
