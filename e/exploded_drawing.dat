50|$|Two albums were {{released}} after the band signed {{to the larger}} label Touch and Go Records. Their debut for the label was 1996's double-length <b>Exploded</b> <b>Drawing,</b> an eclectic, progressive effort that began to delve more explicitly into the guitarists' fascination with Asian music. Drummer Watkins amicably left the band afterward to pursue career and family interests. The {{rest of the group}} was beginning to drift apart as well. Brylawski moved to New York City to attend graduate school and also traveled to India, while Bowie had already relocated to Boston by 1994 to join then-girlfriend, Helium frontwoman Mary Timony. Polvo reconvened in 1997 to record Shapes with new drummer Brian Walsby. Both Touch and Go releases featured a darker, more progressive rock-oriented sound instead of their earlier, post-punk influenced style. Rumors that it would be their final album proved true when they amicably disbanded later that year, ending their farewell US tour with a two-night stand at hometown club Cat's Cradle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper reports {{preliminary}} results on design and fabrication of {{a cutting tool}} with an integrated triaxial force sensor to be applied in fetal surgery procedures. The outer diameter of the proposed device is 7. 4 mm, but a scaled down design can be easily achieved. Linearity and hysteresis tests have been performed for both normal and tangential loadings. A linear transformation relating the sensor output to the external applied force is introduced and discussed. The typical working range for the conceived instrument is around 0. 3, while 20 and 1 are, respectively, maximum normal and tangential forces for which the device robustness has been assessed. Index Terms—Fetal surgery, minimal invasive surgery, “smart ” surgical tool, triaxial force sensor. Fig. 1. <b>Exploded</b> <b>drawing</b> of the proposed surgical tool. Inset: Focused Ion Beam image of the silicon triaxial force sensor. I...|$|E

50|$|An <b>exploded</b> view <b>drawing</b> is a diagram, picture, {{schematic}} {{or technical}} drawing of an object, {{that shows the}} relationship or order of assembly of various parts.|$|R
5000|$|Assembly {{drawings}} {{show how}} different parts go together, identify those parts by number, {{and have a}} parts list, {{often referred to as}} a bill of materials. [...] In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an <b>exploded</b> view <b>drawing</b> or diagram.These parts may be used in engineering.|$|R

This essay considers what Arabic music and specifically that of Joujouka meant to Burroughs, with particular reference to The Ticket That <b>Exploded</b> (1962). <b>Drawing</b> on The Ticket, Burroughs’s letters, critical studies and biographical material, it demonstrates that his understanding of what the music was and did was fundamental to his creative mission...|$|R
5000|$|Engineering {{practice}} makes {{a distinction}} between [...] "mathematical models" [...] and [...] "physical models"; the cost of fabricating a physical model can be minimized by first creating a mathematical model using a computer software package, such as a computer aided design tool. The component parts are each themselves modelled, and the fabrication tolerances are specified. An <b>exploded</b> view <b>drawing</b> is used {{to lay out the}} fabrication sequence. Simulation packages for displaying each of the subassemblies allow the parts to be rotated, magnified, in realistic detail. Software packages for creating the bill of materials for construction allows subcontractors to specialize in assembly processes, which spreads the cost of manufacturing machinery among multiple customers.

40|$|Taking things apart is easy. How {{something}} works, or {{even what}} it is, {{is irrelevant to}} its dismantling. If assembly can {{be perceived as a}} rational act, then disassembly is certainly its counterpart: an intuitive, foolproof, and mindless errand of the seemingly curious subject. It is in this unflattering description, however, that disassembly warrants an analysis of its smart potential Smart Disassemblies locates the <b>exploded</b> view <b>drawing,</b> a representation that conveys the instructions for assembly, within its architectural legacy, from its origins in the Renaissance to its more contemporary appropriation by Thom Mayne and Daniel Libeskind. The categorical rules, and the part-to-whole relationships they imply, gleaned from these precedents are then subverted toward the end of disassembling an object. The proposed rule sets (Point of Explosion, Point of View, and Explosion Sequence) and their variants are tested through their application to a complex assembly of objects, a jazz quintet...|$|R
30|$|People live {{in various}} social networks, and share {{information}} and ideas {{with friends in}} the form of word-of-mouth (WOM) communication. New technologies and various social media rapidly penetrate into every aspect of our daily life, and provide us new channels and great convenience to exchange information and express opinions. They disseminate massive volumes of information over different social media, and spread influence to each other. As social media becomes prevalent, its influence on business, politics and society becomes evident and significant. How new innovations, behaviors, and diseases spread through social networks {{has a long history of}} study in social sciences. Research in this area has <b>exploded</b> and <b>drawn</b> considerable attention from many disciplines over the last decade. Many models of information and influence diffusion have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, such as viral marketing (Kempe et al. 2003; Bhagat et al. 2012), cascading behavior and prediction (Leskovec et al. 2007; Cheng et al. 2014), information spreading (Morales et al. 2014), outbreak detection (Leskovec et al. 2007), etc. In this paper, we look into modeling influence diffusion in the setting of viral marketing in business.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 In the Java {{object-oriented}} programming language, {{a certain amount}} of memory overhead beyond an object's fields is required for each object instance. In simulations or other applications with millions of individual object instances, the per-object overhead can be substantial. This dissertation introduces the optimization technique of object exploding, in which fields of large numbers of objects are represented in parallel arrays. The problem space from which specific object <b>exploding</b> approaches are <b>drawn</b> is defined, and the "Restriction Approach" is described in detail. It is hypothesized that the restriction approach to object exploding can result in a factor-of-two improvement in application performance and a corresponding decrease in memory requirements. A prototype implementation is described, along with experimental results indicating that the restriction approach to object exploding can result in a factor-of-two or greater increase in application performance as well as a significant reduction in memory requirements...|$|R
5000|$|Parker {{has made}} other {{interventions}} involving historical artworks. For example, she wrapped Rodin's The Kiss sculpture in Tate Britain with {{a mile of}} string (2003) as her contribution to the 2003 Tate Triennial Days Like These at Tate Britain. The intervention was titled The Distance (A Kiss With String Attached). She re-staged this intervention {{as part of her}} mid-career retrospective at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, in 2015. Subconscious of a Monument (2005) is composed of fragments of dry soil, which are suspended on wires from the gallery ceiling. These lumps are the now-desiccated clay which was removed from beneath the Leaning Tower of Pisa in order to prevent its collapse.Avoided Object is the title of an ongoing series of smaller works which have been developed in liaison with various institutions, including the Royal Armouries, British Police Forces and Madame Tussauds. These [...] "avoided" [...] objects have often had their identities transformed by being burned, shot, squashed, stretched, <b>drawn,</b> <b>exploded,</b> cut, or simply dropped off cliffs. Cartoon deaths have long held a fascination for Parker: [...] "Tom being run over by a steamroller or Jerry riddled with bullet holes. Sometimes the object's demise has been orchestrated, or it may have occurred accidentally or by natural causes. They might be 'preempted' objects that have not yet achieved a fully formed identity, having been plucked prematurely from the production line like Embryo Firearms 1995. They may not even be classified as objects: things like cracks, creases, shadows, dust or dirt The Negative of Whispers 1997: Earplugs made with fluff gathered in the Whispering Gallery, St Paul's Cathedral). Or they might be those territories you want to avoid psychologically, such as the backs, underbellies or tarnished surfaces of things." ...|$|R
