40|$|In {{metallic}} <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> processes, {{the formation}} of a thin continuous and uniform alloy layer is critical in providing the vital metallurgical bond at the substrate-coating melt interface. When the alloy layer isn't uniform, bare spots or uncoated areas are formed which greatly affect the corrosion resistance and surface appearance of the coated product. Direct and indirect dynamic measurements of mass transfer during metallic coating are difficult, if not impossible. However, the concept of interfacial resistance to mass transfer is analogous to that of interfacial resistance to heat transfer. Using this concept, measurements based on dynamic reactive wetting and thermal interfacial resistance were performed at millisecond resolution to study the effects of low carbon substrate oxidation on {{the formation of}} 55 Al-Zn- 1. 6 Si <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings.

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating {{of iron and}} steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of <b>hot</b> <b>dip)</b> processes precede the <b>coating</b> step. Moreover, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> is made with the Galfan ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight).

50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, <b>hot</b> <b>dipping,</b> {{galvanic}} <b>coating,</b> metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is <b>hot</b> <b>dipping.</b> The process of <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R

40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanizing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods to apply zinc-based coatings on steels in order to provide sacrificial protection against corrosion over all the steel surface. The efficiency of the protection is affected by the coating mechanical response to loading: cracking and coatings delamination during forming and/or during service could decrease the corrosion resistance and could allow the contact between the environment and the substrate (the steel). The aim of this work is the analysis of the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> zinc <b>coated</b> steel plates mechanical properties by means of a non-standardized bending test performed minimizing both the bending moment differences along the bending axis and the interactions between the clamping system and the specimen coating. Bending tests are performed both on non-coated and on <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> zinc <b>coated</b> plates, correlating the measured variables (applied load and crosshead displacement) with the bending moment and the specimen bending angle. Tests are characterised by a good repeatability. Results show that the main damaging mechanisms depend on the different mechanical behaviour of the intermetallic phases and on their thickness. For all the investigated coating conditions, radial cracks are observed. They initiate corresponding to the Γ phase and propagate up to the ζ−η interface. The coating thickness increase implies both an increase of the importance of the cracks in δ and ζ phases and the presence of cracks at ζ−δ interfaces. As a consequence, the increase of coating thickness implies an increase of the susceptibility to a coating-steel debounding damage mechanism, with a consequent loose of the coating adhesion and a decreasing of the capability of the zinc coating to improve the steel corrosion resistance. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} an {{investigation}} into the effect of alloying additions (Mn, Cu, Sb and Zr) on microstructure and corrosion of Zn alloys and <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised coatings was undertaken. The first part of this thesis focuses on the effect of alloying additions on the corrosion of Zn alloys. The result shows that Mn is the most beneficial addition, which can significantly improve the resistance of Zn. The effect of Cu depends on its concentration. A high level of Cu addition has a deleterious effect on the corrosion resistance as the Cu-rich particles are catalytic cathodic sites for oxygen reduction. Additions of Zr and Sb were found to have minor effect on the corrosion behaviour of Zn alloys. The effect of these additions on the microstructure of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised coatings was investigated in the second part. Both Zr and Mn can inhibit the layer growth of active steels with high Si content. Thus, Mn and Zr might be an alternative addition to Ni which can control the excessive reaction of the active steels. Addition of 0. 8 wt % Cu significantly increases the coating thickness of the galvanised steel containing 0. 02 wt % Si. The growth kinetics of the alloy layers follows a linear law. The final part of this thesis focuses on the effect of these additions on the atmospheric corrosion resistance and electrochemistry of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised coatings. Among the alloying additions investigated in this study, Mn is the most beneficial addition to the Zn bath and can significantly improve the resistance of the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised <b>coating</b> to atmospheric corrosion. The effect of other additions on corrosion resistance is minor. The beneficial effect of Mn addition is mainly due to the formation of a Mn-rich oxide layer on the top surface during the galvanising process, which can greatly inhibit the cathodic reactivity of the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised <b>coating.</b> Coupled with the relatively low cost and ease of alloying of this element, these various factors suggest that Mn might have broader applications in general galvanising.

The results obtained by this outdoor exposure test are as follows. 1) After 6 month exposure, the three kinds of uncoated steel sheets showed equal corrosion rates of about 10 mg/dm^ 2 /day. Their corroded conditions were also equal to each other. The two kinds of zinc coated steel plates were increased in weight slightly due to oxidation of zinc. 2) Both the specimens coated with protective paints on their surfaces with slight rust and with no rust, respectively, showed no fault and no difference in their appearance. All paints coated on the surfaces with no rust showed good adhesive strength, and onc on-rust paints showed poor adhesive strength. 3) The results of cross cut test were nearly the same as those of pull off test, except when the overcoatability between the undercoat and the top coat was poor. 4) The impact strength of the coated paints in the initial stage was poorer than that after exposure. The longer the exposure period, the more improved this strength...|$|R
40|$|The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has a need {{to develop}} and field a {{low-cost}} option for the long-term storage {{of a variety of}} radiological material. The storage option’s primary requirement is to provide both environmental and physical protection of the materials. Design criteria for this effort require a low initial cost and minimum maintenance over a 50 -year design life. In 1999, Argonne National Laboratory-West was tasked with developing a dry silo storage option for the BN- 350 Spent Fuel in Aktau Kazakhstan. Argon’s design consisted of a carbon steel cylinder approximately 16 ft long, 18 in. outside diameter and 0. 375 in. wall thickness. The carbon steel silo was protected from corrosion by a duplex coating system consisting of zinc and epoxy. Although the study indicated that the duplex coating design would provide a design life well in excess of the required 50 years, the review board was concerned because of the novelty of the design and the lack of historical use. In 2012, NNSA tasked Idaho National Laboratory (INL) with reinvestigating the silo storage concept and development of alternative corrosion protection strategies. The 2012 study, “Silo Storage Concepts, Cathodic Protection Options Study” (INL/EST- 12 - 26627), concludes that the option which best fits the design criterion is a passive cathotic protection scheme, consisting of a carbon steel tube coated with zinc or a zinc-aluminum alloy encapsulated in either concrete or a cement grout. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipped</b> zinc <b>coating</b> option was considered most efficient, but the flame-sprayed option could be used if a thicker zinc coating was determined to be necessary...|$|R
