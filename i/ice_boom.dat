50|$|These {{methods include}} {{stabilizing}} freeze without restricting water flow, such as implementing weirs and <b>ice</b> <b>booms,</b> installing water jets {{to break up}} any accumulation that might occur, and using manual labour to rake away the accumulation. This final method is often not preferred because of high labour costs, cold, wet and late night working conditions. Back flushing is another technology that uses the idea of cancelling out the differential pressure caused by the frazil ice accumulation. This technology creates a high pressure on the downstream side of objects to reverse the differential pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Structural {{adaptations to}} the river channel or the {{placement}} of dams and <b>ice</b> <b>booms</b> would control where ice jams would form.

40|$|Ice control {{structures}} (ICS) come in many shapes and sizes. Their deployment {{over the last}} twenty years has almost always provided some degree of protection to local residents, although, in most of the seven cases we studied, their performance was less than optimal. Based at work done at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Lever et al. (1997 & 1999) have explained their functionality and have optimized their design. The CRREL ICS consists primarily of a series of piers forming a comb-like structure that arrests ice jams. However, recent physical model studies at Laval University using polyethylene ice suggest that ICSâ€™s using either (1) widely-spaced piers supporting steel nets or (2) cylindrical steel <b>ice</b> <b>booms</b> supporting steel nets could represent more effective and economical structures for some applications. This paper presents these ICS-steel net structures, their performance under laboratory conditions and discusses potential implementation opportunities and problems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Upper Niagara River <b>Ice</b> <b>Boom</b> (LENRIB) {{every winter}} near the {{entrance}} to the upper Niagara River prior to ice formation on Lake Erie. The purpose of LENRIB is to promote the formation of a stable ice cover on Lake Erie {{near the entrance}} of the Niagara River. It significantly reduces the volume of ice entering the Niagara River and reduces the potential for ice jamming downstream. The <b>ice</b> <b>boom</b> was originally designed for fabrication from Douglas Fir timber (Figure 1) that was replaced in the fall of 1997 with cylindrical steel pontoons. The boom was designed to restrict, but not necessarily eliminate completely, the movement of broken lake ice into the Niagara River. The new design developed in 1997 increased the resistance of the boom by at least three fold while maintaining the maximum resistance at 40 % of the span and anchor cables resistance capacity. One major event occurred on February 4 th, 2003, where one anchor cable broke and precipitated the failure of 13 adjacent span cables. The analysis showed that the average wind during the event was at 49 km/hr, which constituted a 1 -in- 37 -years event. To prevent such an event from occurring again, the NYPA started to monitor the Freezing Degree-Days (FDD) and break the ice that surrounds the boom using the icebreaker as soon as this value reaches 200 FDD. This recommendation was started during the winter season of 2004 / 05...|$|E

From {{executive}} summary: A {{study conducted}} in 1987 at Bellows Falls Station showed that under certain conditions, up to 37 percent of downstream migrating smolts passed downstream of the powerhouse via the log and ice sluiceway, thereby avoiding turbine passage. The {{present study was}} conducted primarily to evaluate whether lighting modifications to the log and <b>ice</b> <b>boom</b> and sluiceway entrance would promote smolt utilization of the sluiceway for downstream passage. Other study components included a preliminary assessment of smolt migration and behavior at Vernon Dam (located 35 miles downstream), and {{an assessment of the}} practicability of sluiceway netting of smolts at Bellows Falls Station. This study indicated that the lighting modifications did not substantially improve smolt utilization of the sluiceway for bypassing the turbines...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to connect two {{isolated}} neighborhoods within the post-industrial city of Buffalo, NY. The design strategy capitalizes on existing opportunities in Silo City, a neighborhood of abandoned grain elevators that attracts visitors with intermittent activities and seasonal events; and the Old First Ward, a river side residential neighborhood once home to grain elevator laborers. The two are separated by the Buffalo River, a barrier that once linked the two economically. There are three strategies within the Master Plan - River, Rail Spine and Ward Plan, each {{of which could be}} further developed and work together simultaneously. This thesis develops the River Plan and the urban elements within it. Each urban element within the plan can either repurpose, construct or deconstruct features along the river. One of these proposed elements is the <b>Ice</b> <b>Boom</b> Room which both repurposes a site and constructs a new building by using a seasonal and industrial process of the controlled melting of the ice on Lake Erie each winter as an opportunity to connect two neighborhoods year-round. This thesis asks how post-industrial cities like Buffalo can harness existing industrial and natural processes to promote growth and change. by Laura R. Schmitz. Thesis: M.

50|$|Large {{blocks of}} <b>ice</b> {{commonly}} threaten <b>booms,</b> pushing free-flowing logs over the structures. Significantly {{large chunks of}} ice can even gain enough power so as {{to break through the}} boom altogether, freeing the logs and endangering unsuspecting people and wildlife located downstream. Moreover, flooding and the changing of the seasons fluctuate water levels, occasionally causing jams that can extend for miles on end.|$|R

It is a cold-trap cave, where {{cold air}} enters the cave and is unable to leave, {{resulting}} in the entrance pitch and floor being covered in several metres of clear, smooth ice. The name derives from the acoustics of the cave.

40|$|The thesis aims to {{find the}} changes in design and {{execution}} to immersed tunnels in subarctic regions. The Orlovsky Tunnel in St. Petersburg serves as a case study. The Orlovsky tunnel is a 1600 m tunnel in a rapid flowing river. the ice regime of the Neva River is characterized by frazil ice, which causes hanging ice jams and anchor ice. Together with changes in the flow velocity profile in the frozen period, a more robust tunnel protection is required. Thermal expansion of ice, drift ice, and drag on an ice cover require a sloped embankment to reduce shear, which in turn increases the surcharge on the tunnel. Rubber gaskets such as the Gina and Omega profiles are researches and suggestions are given for rubber composition, {{and its effect on}} fatigue, watertightness, strength, and transport requirements. Thermal loading of the tunnel was also analyzed. It was concluded that the plastic hinge capacity of the corners was sufficient to resist the temperature differential in the outer sections of the tunnel. Cracking of the inner walls require extra horizontal reinforcement. Large temperature fluctuations may require alternate types of expansion joints or smaller tunnel elements. A probabilistic planning was finally performed to quantify the risk of non-completion in a single ice-free construction period. For this a Monte Carlo simulation was utilized. This had implication on the number of tunnel elements, foundation, the construction dock location, and so forth. Emergency measures, such as a frazil collector and <b>ice</b> <b>boom</b> are recommended in the case of early frost. Hydraulic StructuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ice</b> market <b>boomed</b> and <b>ice</b> {{was being}} transported from {{anywhere}} possible to many {{cities in the}} United States. New York City and Chicago were major consumers of American ice because there were higher densities of people and businesses that heavily relied on ice. [...] But many problems arose from the relatively new industry {{that did not have}} the best technology to ensure a sufficient supply and that wasted much of the ice during the transportation process. Since the demand for ice was so high in nearly all of the United States, any delay or shortage in supply threatened the people with an ice famine. Some of the main causes of ice famines were unreliable trains as modes of transport, ever increasing prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. [...] Unfortunately, the people who controlled the ice supply in America could not control every variable that helped produce large quantities of ice, so it was never guaranteed that the American demand would be met.|$|R
