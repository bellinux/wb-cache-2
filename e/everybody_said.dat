500|$|The {{neutrino}} {{accounted for}} the missing energy, but Fermi's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that {{would be difficult to}} observe directly. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, and concluded [...] "there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino." [...] In 1951, {{at the conclusion of the}} Greenhouse test series, Reines received permission from the head of T Division, J. Carson Mark, for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics. Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos. [...] "So why did we want to detect the free neutrino?" [...] he later explained, [...] "Because <b>everybody</b> <b>said,</b> you couldn’t do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but <b>everybody</b> <b>said</b> I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of [...] on the Nintendo 64 in 1996, LucasArts began {{planning}} a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction {{was inspired by a}} level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because <b>everybody</b> <b>said,</b> 'Why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E
500|$|From 1991 to 1994, {{alongside}} The Simpsons, Smith {{was one of}} {{the lead}} cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything. <b>Everybody</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. <b>Everybody</b> <b>said</b> wow and went home to {{try to come up with}} something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

Another audio-work of Warhol's was his Invisible Sculpture, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 March 1923 the No.3 {{issue of}} LEF {{came out in}} which the poem was published. On 3 April 1923, {{speaking}} at a Proletkult meeting, Mayakovsky made an attempt to define the poem's main idea which, apparently, remained unclear to many of his colleagues. [...] "Here <b>everybody</b> <b>said</b> how impossible it is to capture this poem's leitmotif. What you've heard were only fragments, but even from them the leitmotif is clear: it's the everyday life routines. Which haven't changed, and are still our worst enemy, making the philistines out of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1987–88 season saw {{the club}} {{promoted}} to the First Division, then the highest tier of English league football, for the first time. Sheringham scored the first goal in Millwall's first home game in Division One. Millwall briefly topped {{the table at the}} start of October 1988 and the goals of Sheringham (15) and Cascarino (15) kept Millwall in the top four for most of the season before fading after Easter to finish in 10th position. Sheringham said in his autobiography: [...] "It was a crazy exhilarating time. There we were, little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. <b>Everybody</b> <b>said</b> it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money. We were beating the best teams when we shouldn't and getting away draws to which we had no right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Sir Rudolf Bing's {{departure}} as director, Sills {{finally made}} her debut at the Metropolitan Opera on April 7, 1975 in The Siege of Corinth, receiving an eighteen-minute ovation. Other operas she sang at the Met include La traviata, Lucia di Lammermoor, Thaïs, and Don Pasquale (directed by John Dexter). In an interview after his retirement, Bing stated that {{his refusal to}} use Sills, {{as well as his}} preference for engaging, almost exclusively, Italian stars such as Renata Tebaldi due to his notion that American audiences expected to see Italian stars – was the single biggest mistake of his career. Sills attempted to downplay her animosity towards Bing while she was still singing, and even in her two autobiographies. But in a 1997 interview, Sills spoke her mind plainly, [...] "Oh, Mr. Bing is an ass. hile <b>everybody</b> <b>said</b> what a great administrator he was and a great this, Mr. Bing was just an improbable, impossible General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera....

2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} that Israel sinned with fire {{in making the}} Golden Calf, as [...] says, [...] "And I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf." [...] And then Bezalel came and healed the wound (and {{the construction of the}} Tabernacle made atonement for the sins of the people in making the Golden Calf). The Midrash likened it to the words of [...] "Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals." [...] The Midrash taught that Bezalel was the smith whom God had created to address the fire. And the Midrash likened it to the case of a doctor's disciple who applied a plaster to a wound and healed it. When people began to praise him, his teacher, the doctor, said that they should praise the doctor, for he taught the disciple. Similarly, when <b>everybody</b> <b>said</b> that Bezalel had constructed the Tabernacle through his knowledge and understanding, God said that it was God who created him and taught him, as [...] says, [...] "Behold, I have created the smith."
