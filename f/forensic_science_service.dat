5|$|The <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E

5|$|By 1949, the CIA {{claimed that}} Jevđević's {{intelligence}} material {{was being used}} by the Italian Ministry of Interior, the United States Counterintelligence Corps, British <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and Paris. His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, Konstantin Fotić, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maček's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, Canada, Australia and various European countries.|$|E

25|$|Scientists at the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> (FSS) {{examined}} the scarf {{which had been}} tied around Tiernan's neck and found a hair caught in the knot which {{did not belong to}} her. The FSS were unable to extract a DNA profile from the hair's root using conventional DNA tests so carried out mitochondrial DNA testing within the shaft of the hair. This provided a DNA profile which matched Taylor's.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of DNA amplification by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable microsatellites, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the Mengele case. STR profiling was further refined {{by a team of}} scientists led by Peter Gill at the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the UK National DNA Database (NDNAD) in 1995. With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database {{whether or not they are}} convicted (different rules apply in Scotland). The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database, and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.|$|E

Toxicological services are also provided to hospitals.|$|R
500|$|Hodgson {{appealed the}} conviction, but his pre-trial confessions, his {{knowledge}} of the [...] "secret details" [...] and his refusal to take the stand during the trial led to the application for leave to appeal being refused: [...] "n 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service,</b> as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained." [...] Hodgson, who was at that time in the prison hospital, became more seriously ill, his solicitor was unable to take further instructions, and the line of inquiry was closed.|$|E
500|$|The murder investigation, named Operation Green, {{was led by}} Sir Edward Crewe, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, and {{included}} 100 police officers and 50 support staff from the West Midlands and West Mercia forces. Detectives viewed {{hundreds of hours of}} CCTV footage, gathered more than 100 separate exhibits and interviewed witnesses. Evidence was analysed by scientists from the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> (FSS) in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence: [...] "The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of it all... was Philip Smith. In 20 years of working for the FSS, I have never had to deal with so much evidence in relation to one suspect. It was quite overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|Hair {{and other}} fibres were {{collected}} from areas {{in the car and}} apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007. At this point, according to the Sunday Times, the Polícia Judiciária [...] "abandoned the abduction theory". On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, Polícia Judiciária regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry. When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, The Daily Telegraph identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns. Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty.|$|E

2500|$|The second DNA profile, {{the one in}} the {{original}} report that matched half the Norwegian population, was this time either not reported, or reported to be a contamination, and in addition so small that it would be illegal to present in court in other countries. Dr. Susan Pope from the <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Service</b> in London believed the prosecutors had received an erroneous translation of the report since the second match was presented as [...] "incriminating evidence" [...] in court, and the Santiago de Compostela institute in Spain had denied that their report described the second match as incriminating evidence. State prosecutor Jostein Johannesen wrote in 2010 that [...] "it's unfortunate that the police presented this as incriminating evindene against Viggo Kristiansen".

40|$|Abstract The {{creation}} of a competitive market to provide <b>Forensic</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Services</b> (FSSs) to the police within England and Wales has resulted in some notable gains but current trends are now attracting predictions of potential disaster. This article describes the background to the present arrangements and provides an analysis of predicaments exacerbated by {{the closure of the}} FSS—namely the regulatory gap, the justice deficit, market instability, and threats to research and development. Drawing on Gallop’s professional experience as a forensic scientist and both authors’ involvement in the Independent Police Commission, this article argues that a free market will inevitably result in compromises to the criminal justice system. Suggestions are posed for a managed market to avert disaster...|$|R
