5|$|For Piłsudski {{this was}} a major shock, shaking his belief that Poland could {{function}} as a democracy and making him favor government by a strong <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> became Chief of the General Staff and, together with Minister of Military Affairs Władysław Sikorski, managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|On the one <b>hand</b> <b>he</b> didn't commit {{war crimes}} {{that we know}} of and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere and he was a servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
50|$|He's got {{the whole}} world in his <b>hands.</b> <b>He's</b> got you and me, brother in his <b>hands.</b> <b>He's</b> got you and me, sister in his <b>hands.</b> <b>He's</b> got the little bitty baby in his <b>hands.</b> <b>He's</b> {{got the whole}} world in his hands.|$|R

5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one <b>hand</b> <b>he</b> must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other <b>hand</b> <b>he</b> had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|Cannan {{travelled}} {{widely in}} the combat areas to see conditions at first <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> visited New Guinea between 19 October and 21 December 1943 and in February and March 1944. In October 1944, Cannan travelled with General Blamey to visit General Douglas MacArthur in Hollandia {{in order to}} prepare for Philippines campaign. In the event, plans to employ Australian troops in the Philippines fell through and they were employed in the Borneo Campaign instead. Cannan visited New Britain, Lae, Hollandia, Bougainville and Aitape in February 1945 to help plan the final campaigns and Hollandia, Morotai, Labuan and Darwin in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E

5|$|In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month {{fellowship}} for {{journalism in}} London. During {{this time he}} traveled extensively in Britain, France and Africa and witnessed the devastation of WWII first <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> served as the El País war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General Charles de Gaulle after the latter's return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs {{at the invitation of}} the BBC and France's Ministry of Information.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October 2009, in a {{game against}} the Sacramento Kings, a bat descended onto the court at the AT Center, causing a {{stoppage}} of play. As the bat flew past, Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> then carried the creature off the court, earning the applause of the crowd. On 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, Punk gatecrashed {{the joint}} WWE–Mattel panel at the San Diego Comic-Con International with title belt in <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> confronted TripleH and took {{exception}} to WWE attempting to crown a new WWE Champion. Two days later, Punk made a surprise appearance at a show {{hosted by the}} All American Wrestling company without his title belt to endorse Gregory Iron, a wrestler with cerebral palsy, as an inspiration for overcoming his impediment.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 2004, Ramirez {{missed a}} Red Sox game {{to become an}} American citizen. He entered the next game running onto the field to a {{standing}} ovation while carrying a small American flag held in his <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> planted the flag in the left outfield corner of the field, {{in the shadow of}} the Green Monster, where it remained for the entire game.|$|E

5|$|On the one <b>hand</b> <b>he</b> {{must not}} enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must {{leave that to}} the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Thorpe {{announced}} his {{withdrawal from the}} Commonwealth Games due to a bout of bronchitis, which had stopped him from training. Thorpe's illness was later diagnosed as a strain of glandular fever, and after a further delay caused by a broken <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> moved to the United States in July to work with Dave Salo. Further disruption followed when the Australian switched coaches, citing excessive and ongoing media attention. Thorpe's stay was constantly surrounded by rumours that {{he was suffering from}} ill discipline; this fuelled speculation that his international career was on the decline.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{a broken}} {{monument}} that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper {{portion of the}} stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> is trampling {{the figure of a}} bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text {{on the back of the}} monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E

5|$|The 1955–56 Australian {{summer was}} another purely {{domestic}} season. Harvey {{had a successful}} campaign with 772 runs 55.14. He struck 128 and 76 against a New South Wales team composed mainly of Test players, but Victoria's arch-rivals hung on for a draw with three wickets in <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> added two further centuries and a 96, {{and all of these}} innings came in the span of a month in which he amassed 612 runs.|$|E
5|$|The Madison Square Garden {{audience}} {{reacted with}} wild applause and demonstrations {{for half an}} hour. On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's <b>hand,</b> <b>he</b> failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad debuted as a {{professional}} on March 10, 1990, when he was 17years old. The fight was against Angel Romero, another debuting boxer, in a contest that Trinidad won by knockout in the second round. In {{the beginning of his}} career he knocked out nine of his first 10 opponents. He then competed against more experienced boxers like Jake Rodriguez, whom he fought on December 6, 1991. Trinidad won the fight by unanimous decision but suffered an injury on his right <b>hand.</b> <b>He</b> was then inactive for five months while recovering from the injury.|$|E
