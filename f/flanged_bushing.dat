5000|$|A bushing, {{also known}} as a bush, is an {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is {{the most common form of}} a plain bearing. Common designs include solid (sleeve and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched bushing is only a [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved bushing is solid all the way around, a split bushing has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a split bushing but with a [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. A <b>flanged</b> <b>bushing</b> is a sleeve bushing with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|E

The bolt is passed {{through one of the}} pieces to be fastened and threaded onto the nut from the flanged end. The non-flanged end is then inserted through the other piece to be fastened. As the bolt is tightened, friction from the neoprene flange against the piece being fastened prevents the nut from turning. The bushing is compressed by the nut, forming a lip behind the piece being fastened, which compresses the fastened piece and seals the bolt hole. It can also be used in a solid workpiece. As the screw draws the embedded nut towards it, the walls of the well exert a force on the hole walls, anchoring it.|$|R
