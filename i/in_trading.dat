40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is double. First, we empirically explore to what extent the {{determinants}} of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services differs from those of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods and, second, by the use of instrumental variables, we explore for potential complementarities between bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods and bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services. By the use of gravity equations, the main results show that "bilateral trust and contract enforcement environment", "networks", "labor markets" and "technology and technology of communication" have higher impact on service trade than on <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods; finally, after instrumenting for endogeneity, we found that bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods explains bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services: the resulting estimated elasticity is close to 1. Reciprocally, though to a lesser extent, bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services affects positively bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods: a 10 % increase <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services raises <b>traded</b> goods by 4. 6 %. international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services; <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods; gravity equations...|$|R

5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers.

The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{land was}} {{acquired}} by the United States {{in a series of}} treaties and purchases negotiated with the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota and separately with European nations.

5|$|The {{percentage}} of England's population living in towns {{continued to grow}} but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly {{as a consequence of}} the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, as trade from London and the South-West increased in relative significance. Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time and investment <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England.|$|E

It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade in the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources, and it may have been Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods, which was an advantage <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself. Kent traded locally made glass and jewelry to the Franks; Kentish goods have been found as far south as the mouth of the Loire, south of Brittany. There was probably also a flourishing slave trade. The wealth this commerce brought to Kent may have been the basis of the continuing, though diminished, importance of Kent in Eadbald's reign.|$|E
