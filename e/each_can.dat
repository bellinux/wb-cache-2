5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that <b>each</b> <b>can</b> feel confident, <b>each</b> <b>can</b> have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Harmon played {{baseball}} at Walter Johnson Memorial Field, {{named after the}} Hall of Fame pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho. He worked as a farmworker in his youth, where he lifted 10-gallon milk cans, <b>each</b> <b>can</b> weighing about 95lb (43kg). Killebrew earned 12 letters in various sports and was named an All-American quarterback at Payette High School; his uniform number was later retired by the school. He was offered an athletic scholarship by the University of Oregon, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages <b>each</b> <b>can</b> be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Property {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $150,000–200,000. All of the film in the facility was destroyed; more than 40,000 reels of negatives and film prints burned to ashes inside their film cans. Fifty-seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted. <b>Each</b> <b>can</b> contained about five cents' worth of silver; the salvaged metal returned $2,000.|$|E

5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent <b>each</b> <b>can</b> as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, <b>each</b> <b>can</b> produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|Units are {{classified}} {{into one of}} several classes: infantry, ranged, pikemen, cavalry, or siege. Each unit class has unique strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of properly matching up units in battle to increase their effectiveness. Hero units are unique in that only one of <b>each</b> <b>can</b> be created; they consist of characters from the novel, such as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Saruman, Nazgûl, Mouth of Sauron, Arwen and Shelob, or are created via the game's Hero Creator (only accessible via the PC version). If the player kills Gollum, a non-player character, they are rewarded with the One Ring. The item {{can be used to}} summon one of two ring heroes for a price of 10,000 resources, Galadriel and Sauron, depending on the player's faction. Ring heroes have extremely strong armor and powerful attacks, making them among the game's most over-powered units.|$|E

40|$|The {{discrete}} sell or hold problem (DSHP), {{which is}} introduced in H 12, is studied under the constraint that <b>each</b> asset <b>can</b> {{only take a}} constant number of different values. We show that if <b>each</b> asset <b>can</b> take only two values, the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. However, even if <b>each</b> asset <b>can</b> take three different values, DSHP is still NP-hard. An approximation algorithm is also given under this setting...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{analysis}} of network structure and the characteristic of nodes encounter, we establish a regulation to simulate a more real MON, which is described as follows. Nodes in the network are divided into five grades in an ascending way. The first degree includes 35 % nodes, in which <b>each</b> node <b>can</b> encounter with 5 % other nodes. There are 25 % nodes in the second degree, where <b>each</b> node <b>can</b> meet 10 % other nodes in the network. The third degree includes 20 % nodes, in which <b>each</b> node <b>can</b> encounter with 15 % other nodes. There are 15 % nodes in the fourth degree, where <b>each</b> node <b>can</b> meet 20 % other nodes in the network. Moreover, there are 5 % nodes belonging to the fifth degree, where <b>each</b> node <b>can</b> meet 25 % nodes in the network.|$|R
