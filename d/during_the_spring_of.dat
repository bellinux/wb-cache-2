5|$|Written by Brian Hayles, {{this was}} {{submitted}} to the production office <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1971.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1503, Leonardo had {{no income}} source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media.

On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson.
