40|$|We {{present a}} robust location-sensing system that enables devices to {{estimate}} {{their position in}} a self-organizing manner {{without the need for}} an extensive infrastructure or training. The algorithm uses a grid representation that allows the system to easily incorporate external information (such as GPS, application-dependent semantics, geographic and signal strength maps) to improve the accuracy of the position estimation. Depending on the capabilities of the devices, the system can operate in a distributed, centralized, or hybrid fashion. In the case of devices with limited capabilities, a centralized or hybrid approach can be computationally inexpensive and therefore more appropriate. Also, hosts may cooperate and share positioning information. By allowing the cooperation among hosts, the system can improve its accuracy and provide more flexibility. We designed and implemented the system and analyzed its performance via simulations and actual measurements. For example, we used it in an <b>indoors</b> <b>area</b> of 45 x 38 ### with two IEEE 802. 11 access points (APs) in the Department of Computer Science. By using a small training set the algorithm can predict the location of 50 % of hosts with an error of at most 0. 9 m and 85 % of the hosts with at most 2. 5 m accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the density of landmarks, degree of connectivity, range, error in the distance measurements, and grid resolution on the accuracy of the location sensing via simulations. With an error of 5 % of the transmission range, 20 % of the hosts landmarks, and average network connectivity above 7, the average error is less than 2 % of the transmission range...|$|E

40|$|Background. Phlebotominae sand flies are {{the main}} vectors of {{leishmaniasis}} and some other diseases. Materials and Methods. Using sticky traps, sand flies were collected fortnightly from outdoors and <b>indoors</b> <b>areas</b> of selected sites. Results. A total of 2032 specimens (498 {{in the city and}} 1534 in the outskirts of Yazd) belonging to 11 species were collected. The activity of sand flies started in early-April and ended in mid-November. There were two peaks of activity in the end of April and mid-September. Phlebotomus sergenti and P. papatasi were the most abundant species in the city and outskirts of Yazd city, respectively. Other species were P. salehi, P. ansarii, P. kazerouni, P. caucasicus, P. andrejevi, P. alexandri, P. mongolensis, Sergentomyia sintoni, and S. palestinensis. Conclusion.

Achieving this vision requires a deep understanding of a new type of communication channel. Many parameters can affect the performance of passive communication based on visible light: the size of reflective surfaces, the surrounding light intensity, the speed of mobile objects, the field-of-view of the receiver, to name a few.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to ground the ways of improving the level of technical preparedness of highly-qualified archers by means of video and multimedia technologies. Materials and methods: The research studied motor actions of 25 athletes of the national team of Ukraine in archery when they were performing training exercises <b>indoors</b> (exercising <b>area)</b> and outdoors (archery range). Each athlete’s technique of executing shooting exercises was video recorded in sequence from different angles (from above, from behind, from the front, from {{the left and the}} right sides depending on the shooting line) with a digital video camera Sony DCR-XR 150 E. The processing of the video materials was done with the Dartfish Connekt software package. Results: The research grounds the need to use video and multimedia technologies in the process of training of highly-qualified archers. Such methods aim at improving the skills of both coaches and athletes by helping them better understand all aspects of the training exercises execution. Multimedia means offer a delayed-in-time opportunity to watch the video recording of the training after its preliminary computer processing. It enables the coach and the athlete to focus on the analysis of the execution of the entire exercise and its elements. The paper provides examples of the use of video technologies in archers’ training practice. Conclusions: Prospects of the use of the state-of-the-art computer technologies in sports training are infinite. Computer software and hardware systems should be available for most coaches.
