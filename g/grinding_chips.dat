Because GH 4169 has a poor milling performance, the profile precision and surface integrity of blades and integrated blisks are difficult to be met by utilizing the conventional milling process, which directly influence the global performance and reliability of aero-engines. Through grinding experiments on parameters and surface integrity optimization, the helical cantilever grinding process utilizing a 300 # CBN RB wheel is presented and applied in finish machining of GH 4169 blades. The profile errors of the blade surface are within ± 0. 01 mm, the roughness is less than 0. 4 μm, the residual compressive stresses and the hardening rate are appropriate, there are no phenomena of burr and smearing with the <b>grinding</b> <b>chips,</b> and the leading/trailing edge can be smoothly connected with the suction/pressure surface.

40|$|Grinding and {{polishing}} of engineered components are critical {{aspects of the}} precision manufacturing of high performance, quality assured products. Elevated process temperatures, however, are a common {{and for the most}} part undesirable feature of the grinding process. High process temperatures increase the likelihood of microstructural change within the immediate subsurface layer and are detrimental to the strength and performance of the manufactured products. Increasing processing costs and tighter environmental legislation are encouraging industry to seek innovative fluid application techniques as significant savings in production can be achieved. In this context, and with sponsorship from three industrial partners, namely; Fives Cinetic, Fuchs Lubricants plc and Southside Thermal Sciences Ltd, and also from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC), this research aimed to develop an understanding of Minimum Quantity Solid Lubrication (MQSL) as a method for abrasive machining, with particular reference to the control of surface temperatures. Improving the lubricity of Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) fluids reduces the frictional source of process heat and controls the finish surface temperature. The application of effective solid lubricants is known as Minimum Quantity Solid Lubrication (MQSL). Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS 2), Calcium Fluoride (CaF 2), and hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) were compared against a semi-synthetic water soluble machining fluid (Fuchs EcoCool). A series of Taguchi factorial experimental trials assessed their performances through ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) statistical method. The hBN produced the lowest grinding temperatures of the solid lubricants tested, although they still remained higher than those achieved using the EcoCool control. The reduction of the machining fluid enabled a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) sensor to be fitted into the grinding machine. The recorded movement in the emitted spectrum from the <b>grinding</b> <b>chips</b> was compared to experimental and modelled process temperatures. This showed that the wavelengths of the chip light correlated to the temperature of the finish grinding surface. This greatly contributed to determining the feasibility of constructing a non-destructive, non-invasive, thermally-adaptive control system for controlling grinding surface temperatures.

Initially the project scope {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using waste wood in place of propane for heating supply at Rabbit Lake. Several alternatives were approached but because the heating requirements varied significantly depending on the season and wood fuelled systems need to run at the specific design conditions to maintain optimal thermal efficiency, several alternatives were discarded. The wood fuelled cogeneration system was the design proposed because the electrical demands were more stable. The chosen design included one open storage area to store the chips, one hammer grinder to <b>grind</b> <b>chips</b> before feeding, a boiler, a turbine and generator, three conveyors, and a cooling tower.

60|$|Even {{to hammer}} with {{precision}} {{is no easy}} matter, as every one who has tried to learn carpentry will admit. To throw a stone with as true an aim as can a Fuegian in defending himself, or in killing birds, requires the most consummate perfection in the correlated action of {{the muscles of the}} hand, arm, and shoulder, not to mention a fine sense of touch. In throwing a stone or spear, and in many other actions, a man must stand firmly on his feet; and this again demands the perfect coadaptation of numerous muscles. To chip a flint into the rudest tool, or to form a barbed spear or hook from a bone, demands the use of a perfect hand; for, as a most capable judge, Mr. Schoolcraft,[199] remarks, the shaping fragments of stone into knives, lances, or arrow-heads, shews “extraordinary ability and long practice.” We have evidence of this in primeval men having practised a division of labour; each man did not manufacture his own flint tools or rude pottery; but certain individuals appear to have devoted themselves to such work, no doubt receiving in exchange the produce of the chase. Archæologists are convinced that an enormous interval of time elapsed before our ancestors thought of <b>grinding</b> <b>chipped</b> flints into smooth tools. A man-like animal who possessed a hand and arm sufficiently perfect to throw a stone with precision or to form a flint into a rude tool, could, it can hardly be doubted, with sufficient practice make almost anything, as far as mechanical skill alone is concerned, which a civilised man can make. The structure of the hand in this respect may be compared with that of the vocal organs, which in the apes are used for uttering various signal-cries, or, as in one species, musical cadences; but in man closely similar vocal organs have become adapted through the inherited effects of use for the utterance of articulate language.|$|R

Only plastic deformation occurred for WC/Co indicating its higher toughness, while pop-out effect induced by phase transformation in RB-SiC/Si would prompt the chipping at phase boundaries under indentation.

From the analysis of chip dimensions and cutting forces, we speculate that the cutting process during a grinding operation comprises of three phases as follows: (i) lifting up of the surface ahead of the abrasive particle, (ii) segmentation through shear instability, and finally (iii) chip tearing from the surface. Accordingly, the heating cycle is much longer with a lower mean temperature, compared to those of macro machining.

This narrow view is attributable to a lack of direct evidence and an oversimplification of the ethnographic data. In this dissertation I employ new methods to recover evidence of ancient plant foods at Escalera al Cielo (EAC) —a Terminal Classic (A. D. 800 - 950) Puuc Maya settlement located in Yucatán, Mexico—and challenge the notion that all Maya everywhere ate an unvarying diet of agricultural staples. By highlighting the tremendous variety of environments, foods, and food practices as well as the potential biases contained within the ethnohistorical and ethnographic literature, I use the archaeological evidence to reevaluate established models and explore daily food practices at EAC. The research focuses on domestic spaces from three excavated households, the artifacts that formed part of the culinary toolkit (e. g., ceramic vessels, <b>grinding</b> stones, <b>chipped</b> stone tools, and fired clay balls), and microbotanical residues (phytoliths and starch) associated with these spaces and artifacts. Modal analyses of artifacts and identifications of their residues permit testing of functional assumptions about culinary implements (e. g., "maize grinding stones"). The results reveal that most implements were multifunctional and that the food prepared and consumed at EAC included a range of cultivated and wild resources in addition to the expected staple ingredients of maize, beans, and multiple varieties of squash. There are also abundant starch residues from chile peppers (ground for seasonings and salsas), palm phytoliths that may represent foodstuffs, and at least three root crops—arrowroot, manioc, and Zamia sp. —the first of which may have been an additional staple ingredient. These new data illuminate regional food preferences, techniques of preparation, the diversity of food production and procurement strategies, symbolic associations of certain foods (identified in ritual contexts), and the skill and labor required of women who are widely considered to have been responsible for most food practices...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of transportable biomass conversion facility design to evaluate the conceptual and economic viability of a mobile and modular biomass conversion supply chain in the Pacific Northwest, USA. The main goal of this work {{is to develop a}} decision support system to more effectively and sustainably use residual biomass from commercial harvesting operations that are currently piled and burned as part of site preparation. To complete this research a comprehensive biomass supply chain landscape characterization, modeling and optimization study was completed to provide {{an analysis of}} transportable biomass conversion facility design and evaluate its potential economic viability from strategic, tactical and regional perspectives. The long-term goal of this research is to help enable a sustainable marketplace for forest harvest residuals to effectively utilize this waste material and support regional economies. To complete this research the following components were developed: a comprehensive supply chain characterization, a conversion technology and machine rate model, a plant facility costing model, regional spatial and biomass availability data and two economic optimization models. My specific contribution was to examine a spectrum of economic tradeoffs and supply chain considerations including move frequency, logistics, energy costs, moisture content, product viability considerations and regional context related to the implementation of transportable biomass conversion facilities that had previously not been evaluated. Transportable facilities ranging from 15, 000 - 50, 000 BDT/year scale for three products (biochar, briquettes, torrefied wood) within Oregon, California and Washington are reviewed. The work considers various supply chain pathways including supply options at landings (burn, <b>grind,</b> <b>chip,</b> bale), centralized landings (grind/chip), biomass conversion facilities (biochar, briquettes, torrefied wood) and delivery to final market. Within the body of this work, I present three papers where I systematically evaluate the implications of transportable facility design (scale, movement, biomass availability), the economic impacts on the supply chain (logistics, moisture content, product pricing, product production), and the intra-regional variations associated with the system under unique market, product, transportation and energy environments. This analysis was done in an effort to better understand the impacts of transportable conversion facilities and their potential economic viability. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to characterize, evaluate and optimize biomass collection, extraction, logistics and facility placement over a landscape from a strategic level to evaluate the mobility concept over a five year time horizon. This model was then used to evaluate facility economics of scale, optimal movement frequency, and sensitivity to biomass availability within a Lakeview, Oregon case study facility producing biochar. Results indicated significant advantages with larger scale operations with grid-connected power and limited mobility being preferable to a more mobile facility. Results depend greatly on the landscape, assumed harvest schedule, biomass composition and governing biomass plant assumptions. A tactical-level biomass supply chain model is also developed to evaluate and characterize the temporal, logistics and multi-product aspects of the proposed transportable facility design. The model solves a multi-period, multi-commodity, multi-echelon combinatorial problem to maximize net present value using a genetic algorithm. This model was used to evaluate competing biomass logistical systems, the impacts of moisture content on costs (transportation and drying) for a single facility as well as to evaluate the impacts of product conversion efficiencies, product pricing and co-product production economics for six plant configurations within the Lakeview, Oregon case study. Results generally indicated that system viability is largely dependent on market pricing, plant assumptions and conversion estimates while processing and transportation logistics are smaller, but important contributors for small scale biomass conversion faculty design configurations. Moisture content management was found to be an important factor contributing to conversion drying cost with co-generation of products benefiting from production and thermal efficiencies. It was also found that, given the revenue estimates, biochar was the most probable candidate for commercial success pending on market conditions. Finally, a regional study was completed to extend the transportable facility economic analysis to five sites (Lakeview, Oakridge, Warm Springs, Quincy, Port Angeles) encompassing three states over a five year time horizon with three product configurations and an assumed 50, 000 BDT/Year feedstock capacity. This research analyzes the effects of regional differences (logistics, biomass quality and quantity, energy rates, log markets) within the transportable system design to gauge potential economic viability and its sensitivities to fuel, energy and transportation distances. Overall, results indicate that there is a fairly small inter-regional product costing variation (< 10...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to create a tool or equipment which can be used to rotate therefiner rotor and can be installed as an upgrade on all Metso refiner models. The proposed design is driven with a 1. 1 kW electrical motor and a gearbox with a gear ratioof approximately 1 : 217. The torque is transferred from the outgoing gearbox shaft to therefiner shaft with the help of gearwheels. To connect the gearbox gearwheel with the refinershaft gearwheel, the gear motor has to be moveable in a radial direction. This is done by themeans of two shafts that glides in four bushings. On the gearbox shaft a gearwheel with 120 mm of face width is mounted. The large face width is used to take up the axial movement ofthe refiner shaft.

40|$|Rail {{grinding}} is a {{key maintenance}} activity for Network Rail. It is performed at night through possession of the track, so process speed is critical. Increasing the metal removal rate (MRR) of the rail grinding operations would {{be a way to}} improve the time taken for this operation. The aerospace industry has recently seen advances in grinding technologies that have increased MRR. This work was aimed at assessing their best practice and its application to rail grinding operations. Current Network Rail grinding operations include preventative and corrective re-profiling of the rail head. The majority of work performed in the UK is preventative re-profiling with current train speeds ranging from 1 to 10 mile/h. Opportunities exist to increase train speed and improve the productivity of this operation through the use of more advanced grinding technologies. The most relevant aerospace technology is high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG). This approach uses: a high surface speed of the grinding wheel, superabrasive tooling, and high workpiece feed rates to remove material quickly from the cut-zone. Productivity improvements were identified by applying theory on power requirements (by assessing the specific <b>grinding</b> energy) and <b>chip</b> thickness of the grinding process. Computer CAD/CAM modelling was also performed to assess the effect of changing grinding techniques on potential gouging of the track infrastructure and/or interference with example trackside obstructions. The work concluded that opportunities do exist to improve the current productivity of grinding operations. Utilizing HEDG technology theoretically provides a 100 % train speed increase (utilizing the same power available with the current setup) for preventative re-profiling. This requires the application of high surface speeds of the grinding wheel and superabrasive technology. Further increases in train speed require increased spindle power. The chip thickness experienced by grinding grains is reduced for a peripheral grinding setup and high wheel surface speeds that is beneficial for wheel wear. The application of HEDG technology cutting {{on the periphery of the}} wheel provided optimum conditions during CAD/CAM simulation to avoid rail gouging, and any potential collision of the grinding stone with modelled trackside obstructions...|$|R

Chipping reduces the heat and mass transfer limitations while grinding and milling effectively reduce the particle size and cellulose crystallinity due to the shear forces generated during milling. The type and duration of milling and also the kind of biomass determine the increase in specific surface area, final degree of polymerization, and the net reduction in cellulose crystallinity. Different milling methods viz. two-roll milling, hammer milling, colloid milling, and vibratory milling are used to improve the digestibility of the lignocellulosic materials (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008). Compared to ordinary milling process, vibratory ball milling {{is found to be}} more effective in reducing cellulose crystallinity and improving the digestibility of spruce and aspen chips. Also, wet disk milling has been a popular mechanical pretreatment because of its low energy consumption. Disk milling enhances cellulose hydrolysis by producing fibers and is more effective as compared to hammer milling which produces finer bundles (Zhua et al. 2009). Hideno et al. (2009) compared the effect of wet disk milling and conventional ball milling pretreatment method over rice straw. The optimal conditions obtained were 60  min of milling in case of dry ball milling while 10 repeated milling operations were required in case of wet disk milling. Maximum glucose (89.4 %) and xylose (54.3 %) were obtained with conventional ball milling method as compared to 78.5 % glucose and 41.5 % xylose with wet disk milling method. However, wet disk milling had lower energy requirement, high effectiveness for enzymatic hydrolysis, and did not produce inhibitors. Lin et al. (2010) found wet milling better than dry milling for the pretreatment of corn stover. The optimum parameters for milling were particle size 0.5  mm, solid/liquid ratio of 1 : 10, 20 number of steel balls of 10  mm dia each, ball speed of 350  rpm/min grounded for 30  min. Better results were obtained when milling was combined with alkaline pretreatment method. As compared to wet milling process, alkaline milling treatment increased the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of corn stover by 110 %. Sant Ana da Silva et al. (2010) performed a comparative analysis on effects of ball milling and wet disk milling on treating sugarcane bagasse and straw and found ball milling better pretreatment method than wet disk milling in terms of glucose and xylose hydrolysis yields. Ball milling-treated bagasse and straw produced 78.7 and 72.1 and 77.6 and 56.8 %, glucose and xylose, respectively. Kim et al. (2013) compared three different milling methods i.e., ball, attrition, and planetary milling. Attrition and planetary mills were found more effective in reducing the size of biomass as compared to ball milling. Planetary mill produced highest amount of glucose and galactose than other milling methods tested. It is to be noted that all the mill pretreatment methods do not produce any toxic compounds like hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde (HMF) and levulinic acid. This makes milling pretreatment a good choice of preliminary pretreatment method {{for a wide variety of}} lignocellulosic feed stocks. In another study, oil palm frond fiber when pretreated through ball mill produced glucose and xylose yields of 87 and 81.6 %, respectively, while empty fruit bunch produced glucose and xylose yields of 70 and 82.3 %, respectively (Zakaria et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} energy carrier since it is a renewable source and the energy content in the fuel can be stored over time and also generate high temperatures. Bioenergy can be in liquid form, gas-phase or solid. The most common phase is as a solid. Before use, the biomass needs harvesting and refining. Pelletization {{is one of the}} most promising solid fuel qualities with a wide range of benefits which are needed before the product can enter the market and compete with more traditional sources of energy like heating oil and electricity. Despite its benefits, the pellet market still requires development. Several barriers need to be lifted such as understanding the market behavior, finding how bioenergy systems are adapted and what the level of technology is. Pellet feedstock is normally bi-products from sawmills, but increasing demand makes other feedstock alternatives interesting. Pulpwood from pine, straw and husk from agriculture and residue from the furniture industry are examples of new types of feedstock for pellet production. Different feedstocks can bring challenges due to the mechanical properties of the pellet fuel. Also chemical properties can be demanding if the inorganic content in the feedstock is high. The main objectives of the present work are divided into three selected areas; small scale pellets users in Norway, pretreatment of pure feedstock from pine and manufacturing of low-grade feedstock pellets with additives. The following research questions were settled for the work: 1) Which factors lead single household owners to choose wood pellet stoves compared to heat pump solutions and direct electrically heated systems? 2) How will existing users of wood pellets stoves choose if they should have any new system? 3) What is the practical experience of existing wood pellet stove users with aspects like the technical properties of fuel, stove or stakeholders? 4) How does extended storage of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 5) How does high and low temperature drying of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 6) How is the mechanical quality properties of pellets affected by the use of different selected additives? 7) Is the low-grade feedstock pellets made with additives combustible in ordinary grate furnaces/boilers? 8) How are the ash melting properties of difficult fuels affected by the use of selected additives? The research questions are aimed to solve by investigation of market penetration of wood pellet stoves through a survey. Further new pellet feedstocks like pulpwood, agricultural and furniture residues have been produced and tested. Also mixtures with different additives have been produced. The purpose of additives is mechanical fuel quality improvement and increasing the melting point of the ash in the fuel. Finally the new pellet fuel assortments were combusted and tested. All experiments and data collections performed this work is done in an industrial context. <b>Chipping,</b> <b>grinding</b> and pelletization were performed in ordinary industrial plants. Feedstock samples are collected from ordinary harvesting or side-product processes. Combustion is performed in ordinary furnaces/boilers. All processes mentioned above were set up with necessary measurement equipment. This way of experiment approaches have given good validity of the results from the experiments. The market investigation work was performed by a questionnaire among 188 random non-wood pellet users and 461 wood pellet users in Norway. The survey reached a response rate of 45 % from the existing wood pellet users. Factors that influence the decision of purchasing a heating system were identified like the age of the consumer, regional constraints in the availability of pellets and also that economic competitiveness is also weak compared to electrical heating. It was also found that pellet stoves need technical improvements to meet the end-user expectations. The ignition, control system, noise and imperfect combustion are examples of technical factors which need improvement. New pellet feedstocks need treatment prior to the pelletization process. Such process steps are <b>chipping,</b> <b>grinding,</b> storage, drying and possibly the use of additives. In this thesis, several feedstock assortments were manufactured. Pine pulp was stored outside for a year and dried at both high and low temperatures. The high temperature dried material and also stored material resulted in higher energy use for pelletization. There was lower energy consumption for fresh, low temperature dried material. Fresh material was found to have higher durability. Barley straw, barley husk and residue from furniture contain a larger amount of ash and a higher concentration of problematic ash-forming elements compared to conventional woody biomasses. This causes normally severe ash sintering and slagging which were observed in this study. Different raw feedstock were pelletized and combusted together with different additives. These additives might have multifunction such as: 1) improve the properties of fuel pellets from the mechanical point of view and 2) abate fuel ash slagging to achieve an efficient and smooth combustion process. In this work, each raw feedstock was pelletized with different additives in various additive-to-fuel ratios. The influence of additive addition on the pellet production process (i. e., power consumption) and pellet properties (i. e., bulk density, durability and particle density) were investigated. For furniture residue, both sewage sludge and marble sludge improved the durability of the pellets. But when there was a high content of marble, the durability was reduced and the levels of fines increased. Barley straw and barley husk durability were also improved with the lignosulfonate additive. With the marble sludge additive the barley husk durability was increased. Opposite barley straw durability was lowered with marble sludge additive. With combinations of both additives, the positive effect of marble sludge additive for both the barley straw and barley husk was to some extent eliminated. There are significant differences between the composition and ash chemistry of the formed slags. The slag from wood wastes was dominated by K, Na, Si and Ca, which were completely melted and fused into large blocks. The results from the chemical composition analyses of slag samples suggest intensive formation and fusion of low temperature melting alkali silicates. For the barley straw and barley husk that are rich in Si, K, P and Ca, most of the K reacts with both P and Si in ash residues and forms ash melts containing low temperature melting potassium silicates and phosphates. The ash melts were not transported from the grate area in the furnace and gives thereby initiated and enhanced ash slagging which reduces the operation stability of the furnace. Lignosulfonate, marble sludge and sewage sludge are proposed as additives to mitigate ash slagging during the combustion of the studied fuels. Marble sludge served as the most efficient additive to eliminate ash slagging during the combustion of pelletized barley straw, barley husk and wood wastes, respectively. The addition of marble sludge led to the formation of high temperature melting calcium-rich alkali silicates and/or phosphates. This process was accompanied by a significant reduction in ash melts and slag formation. A less pronounced anti-slagging effect was observed from the combustion of lignosulfonate added to barley straw and barley husk pellets. However, the addition of lignosulfonate altered the ash chemistry and promoted the formation of high temperature melting potassium calcium phosphates in ash residues. As result of this, the fraction of ingoing fuel ash that forms slag decreased, and the slags had smaller size and a lower degree of sintering. The addition of sewage sludge slightly reduced the slag formation during the combustion of wood waste pellets. This occurred because sewage sludge contributed to the formation of high temperature melting alkali aluminum silicates. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The Galileo Europa {{data set}} served to {{revolutionize}} {{our view of}} Europa. In particular the strong evidence of a large, cold, salty Ocean beneath 5 - 30 km of ice has profoundly altered the significance of Europa in our thinking, especially of context of habitability in the solar system. While {{much remains to be}} learned from spacecraft observations of several sorts, there are significant questions answerable only by in-situ techniques; these relate to the formation of Europa, the nature of its ocean, and the prospects for life in its ocean, sediments, and ice. We feel that wide-ranging discussion of an in-situ subsurface mission to Europa, as part of JIMO, should proceed. The science objective of the mission is to characterize the icy shell of Europa to resolve its provenance, estimate the composition of brine of the Europa ocean, and search for evidence of Earth-like life. Probably anyone would agree that an in-situ mission to Europa would be of great value, but he or she would also immediately take the position that such a mission is utterly impractical. We take the position here of defining the least complex mission that can nonetheless justify its cost and to argue that such a mission is realistic enough that it should be seriously considered. Our mission thinking has been: 1) Soft landing. A soft lander is required on a site sufficiently flat to offer a stable platform; no further site selectivity is required. 2) Subsurface exploration. The Europa subsurface must be examined. Surficial processes on Europa arguably have exposed the upper 200 m of shell to chemical effects from the Jovian radiation belts as well as cometary infall, etc; to examine native ice we must descend below that point to, for discussion, 300 m. At that depth we argue that the ice is characteristic of ice at depth and possibly is effectively sea ice. 3) Science data. A few simple measurements at various depths and at 300 m constitute a scientifically successful mission. Measurements would include analysis of meltwater for a few inorganic ions and amino acids and an optical examination of the borehole wall. 4) Communication. Transmission of data to an orbiter is essential, but we will constrain the landed mission to a daily communication over a few days. 5) Subsurface access. Drilling to 300 m is a significant challenge; it can be addressed by several means: Thermal Probe (Cryobot) which permits water to refreeze above the vehicle. This is our tentative choice with plutonium as the fuel to generate thermal energy for drilling and electrical power for operations. Open Hole Drill, a thermal system in which the meltwater is removed for greater thermal efficiency. Meltwater removal on Europa is both a complexity and a risk, but analysis is improved. Mechanical Drilling in which cutting or <b>grinding</b> generates ice <b>chips</b> which are removed. This is too complex at Europa temperatures. The measurement objectives for the mission will be: Obj. 1 : Determine the concentration of simple inorganic salts in the Europa Ice Shell and, by extrapolation, of the ocean. These data will also validate spaceborne sensors. Obj. 2 : Determine the nature and abundance of amino acids in the ice such that cometary infall material in the upper ice can be compared to material at depth. Obj. 3 : Optically examine the ice to resolve inclusion structure, particulate content, and stratification. Access to 300 m depth is a significant if not audacious plan; we are aware that this has not been done on any planetary body. Our approach is the use of a plutonium heat source; to overcome Europa's surface temperature and to melt ice a significant amount of plutonium is needed, and significant shielding and other protective steps will be required. The quantity of plutonium is a key concern. The mission will require subsurface collection and processing of samples for in situ analysis, calling for a miniature, high pressure micro-sampling system designed to meet needs of instruments that require low presses for operation. The inlet system itself collects a micro-sample in the external high pressure environment, then transfers it into a protected low pressure environment for analysis...|$|R
