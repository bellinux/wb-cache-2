5|$|Callie takes Sofia to {{live with}} Meredith and Derek, Zola, and Baby Bailey {{for a while before}} kicking Arizona out of their {{apartment}} and celebrates by dancing in her underwear. Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that {{she was the only one}} that needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E
500|$|Meredith {{finds out}} {{she has a}} {{maternal}} half sister named Maggie Pierce who is now working in Grey Sloan Memorial. Meredith is in denial and rejects Maggie, thinking she would have remembered <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was pregnant until she finds a hospital document confirming the revelation. Meredith tries to piece together {{her relationship with her}} mother and half sister by going through old videos of her mother. She eventually recovers her repressed memories of the pregnancy when she views her mother's diary and has a change of heart, choosing to accept Maggie and begin building a relationship.|$|E
60|$|After {{talking with}} Minnie some little {{time from the}} balcony, Rollo asked her <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was there.|$|E
60|$|The funeral {{took place}} in full grandeur. Lady Martindale had made it a special request that every one would mourn as <b>if</b> for <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> {{and it was just}} one of the {{occasions}} when pomp was needed to supply the place of grief.|$|R
6000|$|Something made Cass ask <b>if</b> <b>her</b> {{father and}} <b>mother</b> objected to <b>her</b> boyish tastes. The reply was {{characteristic}} if not satisfactory,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not when there's {{a traitor}} {{within the walls}} {{in the shape of}} a soft heart. And that there will be, <b>if</b> Beatrice has <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> {{tenderness}} as well as <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> beauty.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. It {{would have}} been more to the point <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> had. But as her mother didn't {{something}} else did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why! Jennie?" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Holiday, hesitating. [...] "Let me think. Yes, Jennie may go with you, if she pleases, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> is willing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But, Elder, I don't {{love the}} Mormon {{children}} any less because I love a Gentile child. I shall adopt Fay <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> will give her to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Isaac. [Aside.]Truly, I {{should have}} guessed {{them to have}} been so! <b>If</b> she had <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> spectacles, I believe she would not see the worse.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> you are <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Madame, {{you will}} fancy worms; you will examine her linen for pins, and what not. Ah, hypocrite! you, even YOU, {{misunderstand}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better do}} it, Mary. I'll supply the money." [...] and Aunt Carrol to reply decidedly, [...] "I {{certainly}} will, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> father and <b>mother</b> consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. <b>If</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> is {{behaving}} as sagely {{with her}} as you are with me the chances are that she won't let me. Besides, I don't know that I want to marry quite so much innocence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Beatrix Esmond {{may receive}} a present from our kinsman and benefactor, my lord duke,” says Lady Castlewood, {{with an air}} of great dignity. “She is my {{daughter}} yet: and <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> sanctions the gift—no one else hath the right to question it.” ...|$|E
60|$|When the clear, yellow dawn of Christmas morn awakened the cocks of the corral, I {{heard the}} Doña Maria {{knocking}} at her daughter's door. Opening my own I inquired <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> still slept, begging that I might relieve {{for a time}} her patient watch.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, {{while in}} Auschwitz, the 21 year old Gottliebová {{was chosen by}} Mengele to draw portraits of Romani inmates. Mengele wished to capture the Romanis' skin {{coloration}} better than he could with camera and film at that time. Gottliebová agreed <b>if</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mother's</b> life were spared as well.|$|R
5000|$|Randang is {{a female}} {{orangutan}} two to {{two and a}} half years old. When Bonita is sent to forest school to recover from an illness, Randang keeps climbing on Bonita's back as <b>if</b> she were <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|R
60|$|In superintending these works, {{particularly}} {{that of the}} church-building, her daughter Betty was her constant companion, and the incidents of their execution were doubtless not without a soothing effect upon the young creature's heart. She had sprung from girl to woman by a sudden bound, and few would have recognized in the thoughtful face of Betty now the same person who, the year before, had seemed to have absolutely no idea whatever of responsibility, moral or other. Time passed thus till the Squire had been nearly a year in his vault; and Mrs. Dornell was duly asked by letter by the patient Reynard if she were willing {{for him to come}} soon. He did not wish to take Betty away <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> sense of loneliness would be too great, but would willingly live at King's-Hintock awhile with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't {{actually}} KNOW {{anything against}} her father's nature yet," [...] I suggested; [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> lived a starved and stunted life with him, it {{may account for}} that effect of disappointed greed which I fancied in her when I first saw her." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{said that}} he had come to ask Rollo to go and take a walk to see an old ruin in the town, and he told Minnie that he should be very glad to have her go too, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> would be willing.|$|E
60|$|Having {{placed the}} touring {{cars in the}} care of the garage keeper, the Rovers joined the others on the piazza of the hotel. Then Dora slipped upstairs to see <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and Mrs. Laning were all right. She found both of them {{sleeping}} soundly, and did not disturb them.|$|E
60|$|If {{she knew}} how! There is no knowing how, for a girl, in that matter. <b>If</b> nature and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> {{have not done}} it for her, {{there is no hope}} for her on that head. I think I may say that nature and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> had been {{sufficiently}} efficacious for Lilian Dale in this respect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, Dora {{wrote that}} <b>if</b> she and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> {{could find a}} nice cottage at Los Angeles or Santa Barbara {{they were going to}} invite Nellie and Grace to come out and keep house with them for six months or so." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} too early for breakfast when she had {{finished}} her toilet, so she sat by the open window of her room, looking down into the street, and tried {{to solve the mystery}} of Gran'pa Jim. Better thoughts came to her, inspiring her with new courage. Her grandfather had changed his name to enable him the more easily to escape observation, for it was James Hathaway who was accused, not Colonel James Weatherby. It was difficult, however, for the girl to familiarize herself with the idea that Gran'pa Jim was really James Hathaway; still, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> name before <b>her</b> marriage was indeed Beatrice Hathaway, as the watch proved, then there was no question but her grandfather's name was also Hathaway. He had changed it for a purpose and she must not question the honesty of that purpose, however black the case looked against her beloved Gran'pa Jim.|$|R
60|$|But Stella {{refused to}} take the hint. She almost brought the tears into my eyes, she {{received}} me so kindly. <b>If</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> {{had not been in}} the room--but her mother was in the room; I had no other choice than to enter on my business, as if I had been the family lawyer.|$|E
60|$|Rachel {{had told}} her mother, on her return from the ball, that Luke Rowan had promised to call; and had offered to take herself off from the cottage for the whole afternoon, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> thought it wrong that she should see him. Mrs. Ray had never felt herself to be in greater difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I would from--I {{would have}} said Frenchman or Spaniard, but, poor maid, that may only be her hap, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> should come to her throne again;" [...] and as Humfrey shrugged his {{shoulders}} at the improbability, [...] "But we must see thee off, my boy. Poor mother! this hurries the parting for her. So best, mayhap." ...|$|E
5|$|As players uncover {{enough of}} the story, a chat window appears asking if they are finished. Once players answer affirmatively, it is {{revealed}} that they are Sarah, Eve's daughter. The chat asks Sarah <b>if</b> she understands <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> actions, and asks to meet her outside.|$|R
50|$|After a long heartfelt {{reunion with}} his daughter, Christopher reveals {{that he has}} enemies on the Council. The one who maimed him years before {{was none other than}} Jamison. He tearfully apologizes for taking so long to return to get her; because of his memory loss caused by the beating, and his loss of sight - he had no way of finding her. It was because Matt had gone {{looking for a way to}} make blue for Kira, and {{stumbled}} upon Christopher's Village, explaining where he came from - that the events began to roll forward in such a way that Christopher could again reunite with his daughter. Kira begins to wonder <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> sudden death, as well as the deaths of the two other orphans' parents, were actually by the Council's hand; in order to acquire these young, gifted children - seeking to mold them into creating the future which they want.|$|R
60|$|Had she not? What a pity, Elspeth! What a pity, Tommy! What {{might that}} {{be in the}} bed, Elspeth? It couldn't not be their Hogmanay, could it, Tommy? If Tommy was his mother he would look and see. <b>If</b> Elspeth was <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> she would look and see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Madeline. [...] "She is {{just one}} of those English nonentities who would tie her head up in a bag for three months every summer, <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and her {{grandmother}} had tied up their heads before her. It would never occur to her to think whether there was any use in submitting to such a nuisance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [338] [Lady Noel's {{will was}} proved February 22, 1812. She {{left to the}} {{trustees}} a portrait of Byron ... with directions {{that it was not}} to be shown to his daughter Ada till she attained the age of twenty-one; but that <b>if</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was still living, {{it was not to be}} so delivered without Lady Byron's consent.--Letters, 1901, vi. 42, note 1.] ...|$|E
60|$|Again Elsa sighed--in that quaint, wistful {{little way}} of hers. <b>If</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> {{had been as}} thrifty and as orderly as Ilona, then mayhap her own {{marriage}} with Erös Béla need never have come about. She could have mourned for Andor quietly by herself, {{and the necessity of}} a wealthy son-in-law would probably never have presented itself before her mother's mind.|$|E
5000|$|Karlsen {{was born}} in Oslo (at the time called Kristiania), to rail road {{engineer}} Karl Arnesen (1860 [...] - [...] 1923) and Hilda Alette Torgersdatter (b. 1855). It seems as <b>if</b> though <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> died while Helga was still young, and the girl {{had to go into}} foster care; in early records she appears under the name of Helga Pettersen. She started working at the age of fourteen, first as a maid, later in a café and in a candy factory. She then worked at a trading company for three years before entering into politics.|$|R
60|$|When Legree scolded and stormed, Emmeline was terrified; {{but when}} he laid his hand on her, and spoke as he now did, {{she felt as if}} she had rather he would strike her. The {{expression}} of his eyes made her soul sick, and her flesh creep. Involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto woman by <b>her</b> side, as <b>if</b> she were <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep, [...] Like a {{youthful}} hermitess, [...] 320 [...] Beauteous in a wilderness, [...] Who, praying always, prays in sleep. [...] And, if she move unquietly, [...] Perchance, 'tis but the blood so free [...] Comes back and tingles in her feet. [...] 325 [...] No doubt, she hath a vision sweet. [...] What <b>if</b> <b>her</b> guardian spirit 'twere, [...] What <b>if</b> she knew <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> near? [...] But this she knows, in joys and woes, [...] That saints will aid if men will call: [...] 330 [...] For {{the blue sky}} bends over all! ...|$|R
