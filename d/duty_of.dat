40|$|Are {{positive}} {{duties to}} help others in need mere informal <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> virtue or can they also be enforceable <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> justice? In this paper I defend the claim that some positive duties (which I call basic positive duties) can be <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> justice {{against one of the}} most important prin- cipled objections to it. This is the libertarian challenge, according to which only negative duties to avoid harming others can be <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> justice, whereas positive duties (basic or nonbasic) must be seen, at best, as informal moral requirements or recommendations. I focus on the contractarian version of the libertarian challenge as recently presented by Jan Narveson. I claim that Narveson’s contractarian construal of libertarianism is not only intuitively weak, but is also subject to decisive internal problems. I argue, in particular, that it does not pro- vide a clear rationale for distinguishing between informal <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> virtue and enforceable <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> justice, that it can neither successfully justify libertarianism’s protection of negative rights nor its denial of positive ones, and that it fails to undermine the claim that basic positive <b>duties</b> are <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> global justice...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} Kant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right {{have a moral}} basis, and must {{therefore}} be towards some end. Furthermore, this moral nature means {{there can be no}} heteronomy of law. Moreover, the end for <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right must also conform to the other constraints that are special to <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right that differentiate them from <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Virtue. Namely, the end must also be a limiting condition on action that is externally constrained and begets narrow obligation. I propose that the highest good is the best candidate for this type of end. ^ My main focus is on the Metaphysics of Morals. Other Kantian texts considered include the Groundwork, the three Critiques and political writings. ^ Chapter I defines Kantian concepts like the categorical imperative, maxims and technical imperatives. Chapter II explores the position that <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right do not properly belong in Kant 2 ̆ 7 s morality. Chapters III and IV counter that position by showing possible applications of the categorical imperative in Rechtslehre, and suggesting that the internal incentive, which is essential to <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Virtue, is foundational to societal structure. This provides the moral basis for <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right. Chapter V brings out five important distinctions between <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right and Virtue, all of which I argue the end for <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right must embody. Chapter VI uses Henry Allison 2 ̆ 7 s “Kant 2 ̆ 7 s Doctrine of Obligatory Ends” and Nelson Potter 2 ̆ 7 s “Kant 2 ̆ 7 s Ends that are at the Same Time Duties” to consider obligatory ends for <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right and concludes that these ends are not acceptable. Chapter VII uses Andrews Reath 2 ̆ 7 s article, “Two Conceptions of the Highest Good in Kant,” to explain the notion of the Highest Good. Chapter VIII searches the Metaphysics of Morals for possible <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right and shows how the highest good serves as an end for those duties. I conclude that the highest good nicely unifies <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> Right and Virtue into one moral theory. ...|$|R
