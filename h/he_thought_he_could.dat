5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
5000|$|The son {{was troubled}} by the {{prospect}} because <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> now be comfortable, but in the end, he obeyed. A tiny scrap of paper floated by when he had sunk the money; it contained six shillings.|$|R
50|$|Hunter became {{close enough}} with Etchika Choureau, his co-star in Lafayette Escadrille, and Joan Perry, widow of Harry Cohn, to {{contemplate}} marriage, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> never <b>could</b> maintain a marriage, and remained merely platonic friends with both women.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 April 2017, Farage {{announced}} that he wouldn't stand for Parliament in the 2017 election. <b>He</b> stated that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help out Brexit better {{as a leader of}} a group in the European Parliament.|$|R
5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only method by which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
60|$|He {{wanted to}} make de Marmont talk, {{to hear what the}} young man had to say. From it <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> learn more {{accurately}} what danger would threaten Brestalou in the event of Napoleon's successful march to Paris.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} the Weed Eater trimmer came {{to him from the}} {{spinning}} nylon bristles of an automatic car wash. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> come up with a similar technique to protect the bark on trees that he was trimming around.|$|R
60|$|Phonny {{ran up to}} the trap, {{and took}} hold of it. He lifted it up very cautiously. He shook {{it as well as}} <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and then listened. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hear or feel some slight motion within. He became very much excited.|$|R
25|$|Despite the loss, Mustain felt a {{boost in}} {{confidence}} and stopped taking his ADHD medication, Vyvanse. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> earn money by selling the medication illegally, and was caught and arrested on February 1, 2011. Eventually, he entered into a pre-file community service program {{in order to avoid}} a more severe sentence.|$|E
25|$|He fired {{only when}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> destroy. Two {{hundred and fifty}} yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it. He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, swinging his sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
25|$|But {{all this}} was as yet in the future. Essex's {{military}} promenade in the west of England {{was the subject of}} immediate interest. At first successful, this general penetrated to Plymouth, whence, securely based as <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> overrun Devon. Unfortunately for him, he was persuaded to overrun Cornwall as well. At once, the Cornishmen rose, as they had risen under Hopton, and the King was soon on the march from the Oxford region, disregarding the armed mobs under Waller and Browne.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign policy {{continued}} to be his main strength; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> shape if not control all of European diplomacy, especially by using France is a vital ally and trade partner. [...] However, historians often characterize his method as bluffing more than decisive action.|$|R
60|$|Ernest Merchison ground his teeth, {{understanding}} that in {{face of this}} woman's blind fidelity all argument and appeal were helpless. Then in his love and despair he formed a desperate resolve. Yes, he was very strong, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll rescue her,' he cried, leaping at his weapons. As <b>he</b> leapt <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to please her. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> take his medicine.|$|R
25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, {{so that by the}} time he reached his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E
25|$|In June 1920 Forster {{was offered}} the post of Governor-General of Australia, which he accepted. Shortly afterwards, on 28 June 1920, he was {{appointed}} Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). This was the first occasion on which the Australian government was genuinely consulted about {{the appointment of a}} Governor-General. The Colonial Secretary, Lord Milner, sent the Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, two other suggested appointments before Hughes approved of Forster. Hughes seems to have preferred Forster because {{he was a man of}} modest reputation whom <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> control. His reputation as a sportsman was also an asset.|$|E
25|$|Thus the Spaniards {{pushed on}} {{for two days}} through the woods, streams and swamps, without a trail to follow. On {{the evening of the}} third day, September 19, Menéndez reached the {{neighborhood}} of the fort. The night was stormy and the rain fell so heavily that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> approach it without being discovered, and encamped for the night in the pine grove {{on the edge of a}} pond within less than a quarter of a league from it. The spot he had chosen was marshy; in places the water stood up to the belts of the soldiers, and no fire could be lighted for fear of revealing their presence to the French.|$|E
5000|$|Following the exposé by Anderson, Highwater stopped {{claiming}} Cherokee {{heritage in}} his promotional literature {{but he took}} advantage of having become publicly established as an [...] "Indian" [...] figure. When questioned by Anderson about why he had assumed a Cherokee identity, he said that <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not break into the writing world otherwise.|$|R
60|$|Judge Penfold was all ears at once. Indeed, {{it may be}} as well {{to state}} {{that he was a}} widower and had paid Widow Canby much attention, which, however, I well knew that good lady heartily resented. No doubt <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> render her any {{assistance}} it would help along his suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're on {{the side}} road to Godstone and Warlingham," [...] said my uncle. [...] "I suppose <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make better time by {{getting out of the}} way of the market carts. But we've got the deuce of a hill to come down. You'll see some fun, nephew, or I am mistaken." ...|$|R
500|$|Kruger {{would not}} countenance {{the idea of}} {{returning}} home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> better serve his people by remaining in exile. Steyn similarly {{refused to accept the}} new order and joined Kruger in Europe, though he was later to return. Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were berated by Kruger for [...] "signing away independence"—rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{exposure}} {{he received from}} Kane, Jay-Z was still without a record deal. He began selling tapes from his car with help from friend Damon Dash. The success of his street-level marketing led to a deal with Payday Records, which released his first solo single, [...] "In My Lifetime" [...] and its B-side [...] "I Can't Get wid Dat". In an unconventional move, Jay-Z then spurned the record contract he had long sought and left Payday Records to form his own label, Roc-A-Fella Records, with Damon Dash and Kareem [...] "Biggs" [...] Burke. Jay-Z later explained that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{do a better job}} of marketing his records on his own: ...|$|E
500|$|Nobuhiro Watsuki {{started writing}} Buso Renkin {{thinking}} {{it would be}} his last shōnen manga; he tried to do [...] "everything [...] ever wanted" [...] with that genre. He unexpectedly experienced problems drawing the manga's fight scenes and said he [...] "struggled with the comedic elements". Watsuki drew references from several sources in Buso Renkin; from his past works Rurouni Kenshin and Gun Blaze West to American comics, and from films to other anime and manga. Despite dealing with alchemy, Watsuki initially avoided mentioning the philosopher's stone because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be accused of plagiarizing another series. He could not omit mentioning it, but he said that it is [...] "general knowledge". During the series' publication, Watsuki had four severe colds; the fourth cold made him so weak that he could not finish the chapter he was due to send to Weekly Shōnen Jump.|$|E
60|$|At last, just as {{consciousness}} {{was leaving}} him, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> struggle no more, a hand grasped his arm. The fishermen, joining hand in hand, {{had gone down}} into the surf; and after many ineffectual efforts, had at last seized him, as a retiring wave was carrying him out again, for the fifth time.|$|R
60|$|Jerry Blutt {{had been}} looking the {{situation}} over carefully, and <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they <b>could</b> get to the island by going up the river a distance.|$|R
60|$|Dan trudged slowly on, {{his heart}} growing lighter as the moments {{went by and}} he knew he had {{actually}} gotten away without arousing anyone; but after he had walked some distance he began to realize how heavy Crippy was. <b>He</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> carry his pet almost any length of time; but at the very commencement of his journey his arms began to ache.|$|R
500|$|Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Graham Butcher, {{the ship}} escorted Convoy JW 64 to Murmansk at the {{beginning}} of February. On the 7th, Denbigh Castle claimed to have shot down a German torpedo bomber. Almost a week later, the ship was torpedoed by U-992 as the convoy entered the Kola Inlet at 00:13 on 13 February; the corvette's radar had picked up the submarine at a range of , but had not identified her due to the confused radar returns and darkness. The torpedo struck the bow and the crew thought that the ship had struck a mine. The explosion killed eleven ratings and threw the four-inch gun onto the Squid platform behind it. The remaining bow structure sagged downwards, although Denbigh Castle was in no danger of sinking. The destroyer [...] transferred her medical officer over and the corvette Bluebell came alongside around 00:45 to receive casualties, and Butcher ordered as many ratings aboard her as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> spare. Bluebell began towing Denbigh Castle at 02:05 and reached a maximum speed of , Serapis screening the ships during the tow.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of The Motion Picture, {{executive}} producer Gene Roddenberry wrote his own sequel. In his plot, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise travel back in time to set right a corrupted time line after Klingons use the Guardian of Forever to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This was rejected by Paramount executives, who blamed the poor performance and large budget ($46million) of the first movie on its plodding pace and the constant rewrites Roddenberry demanded. [...] As a consequence, Roddenberry was removed from the production and, according to Shatner, [...] "kicked upstairs" [...] to the ceremonial position of executive consultant. Harve Bennett, a new Paramount television producer, was made producer for the next Star Trek film. [...] According to Bennett, he was called in front of a group including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and asked if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make a better film than The Motion Picture, which Bennett confessed he found [...] "really boring". When Bennett replied in the affirmative, Charles Bluhdorn asked, [...] "Can you make it for less than forty-five-fucking-million-dollars?" [...] Bennett replied that [...] "Where I come from, I can make five movies for that." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "polarised" [...] {{motor car}} had been unsuccessfully tried in the Antarctic by Shackleton, on his 1907–09 expedition, while his {{pioneering}} use of ponies had transported him {{as far as the}} foot of the Beardmore Glacier. Scott believed that ponies had served Shackleton well, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> resolve the motor traction problem by developing a tracked snow [...] "motor" [...] (the forerunner of the Snowcat and of the tank). However, Scott always intended to rely on man-hauling for the polar plateau, believing it impossible to ascend the Beardmore Glacier with motors or with animals. The motors and animals would be used to haul loads only across the Barrier, enabling the men to preserve their strength for the later Glacier and Plateau stages. In practice, the motor sledges proved only briefly useful, and the ponies' performance was affected by their age and poor condition. As to dogs, while Scott's experiences on Discovery had made him dubious of their reliability, his writings show that he recognised their effectiveness in the right hands. As the expedition developed, he became increasingly impressed with their capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Collier {{said that}} one of the biggest reasons for wanting {{to become a part of}} children's books was because of an {{experience}} he had in 1995 at a book store where the books he saw did not look or feel or sound like him or his children. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do better, so that's what he worked towards.|$|R
60|$|The idea of jilting Alexandrina {{instead of}} Lily had never as yet {{presented}} itself to Crosbie, and now, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of it, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not perceive {{that it was}} feasible.|$|R

Had <b>he</b> not <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get supplies from me, he would not have plotted the rebellion." ...|$|R
