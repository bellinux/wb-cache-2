40|$|The {{techniques}} {{employed by}} viruses to avoid detection by antivirus scanners {{are becoming increasingly}} advanced. One technique commonly used by viruses to evade detection is polymorphism. The level of polymorphism in a virus indicates its ability to create different forms of itself. The use of junk instructions is a common technique to increase the level of polymorphism in a virus. Junk instructions are machine code instructions with no other function than to alter {{the appearance of a}} virus. Junk instructions do not contribute to the function of the virus, only the form. This master thesis focuses on the problem of separating junk instructions from nonjunk instructions in computer viruses. To assail the problem, a junk instruction detection (JID) framework has been developed, capable of detecting junk in viruses created for the Intel IA- 32 Architecture R (x 86). JID relies on the static <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> produced by a disassembler. Static <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> describes the static information found in an instruction: the number of input/output operands and their accesses. Because JID only depends on the static <b>instruction</b> <b>information,</b> JID can possible be ported to other processor architectures. As long as there exist a disassembler for the architecture capable of producing static <b>instruction</b> <b>information,</b> JID is portable. The results of testing JID on polymorphic viruses are promising. Tests show that JID manages to detect junk instructions found in the polymorphic virus Zmist. It is believed that JID would work as a tool to detect and remove junk instructions from future polymorphic viruses, thus reducing the time spent analysing the virus. Additionally in this thesis, the virus Zmist is analysed as a case study, and a detection algorithm devised. The detection algorithm manages to detect 100 % of the polymorphic version of Zmist, although shortcomings in the disassembler algorithm reduces this number to 94 %...|$|E

30|$|Given {{the fact}} that the {{interference}} generated by femtocells tends to be a localized phenomenon due to the small coverage and large number of femtocells, centralized methods may be confronted with more challenges with limited control and <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> from the radio network controller, which implies local and possibly distributed solutions will be more practical and efficient. Following this idea, we are interested in the feasibility of interference minimization by multiple femtocells collaboratively in a local area.

Finally, we will incorporate them together to produce our proposed scheme.|$|E

This design supposedly provides the VLIW advantage of increased instruction throughput.

This information is calculated by the compiler, as it would be in a VLIW design. The early versions are also backward-compatible with newer x86 software by means of an on-chip emulator mode.

According to the {{structure}} and information flow of the active control system of large-scale wind farm, a load allocation scheme is proposed considering the wind speed fluctuations within the cluster, i. e. deciding the de-load depth of each turbine according to wind speed fluctuation when the farm is running under AGC mode, using wind turbine generator (WTG) de-load ability to reduce the impacts of wind speed fluctuations on the entire wind farm output. Use particle swarm optimization, prediction of WTG generation, wind speed fluctuation condition, wind scheduling <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> to calculate the WTG de-load depth risk factors, and get the de-load power order distribution scheme.

40|$|In any stored-program {{computer}} system, {{information is}} constantly transferred between the {{memory and the}} instruction processor. Machine instructions are {{a major portion of}} this traffic. Since transfer bandwidth is a limited resource, inefficiency in the encoding of <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> (low code density) can have definite hardware and performance costs. Starting with a parameterized baseline RISC design, we compare performance for two instruction encodings for the architecture. One is a variant of DLX, the other is a 16 -bit format which sacrifices some expressive power while retaining essential RISC features. Using optimizing compilers and software simulation, we measure code density and path length for a suite of benchmark programs, relating performance differences to specific instruction set features. We measure time to completion performance while varying memory latency and instruction cache size parameters. The 16 -bit format is shown to have significant cost-performance advantage [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on textual warnings has mainly focused on individual signal words, but much less research has concerned signal words in context within warnings. The current study investigated printed (visual) warnings statements that contained signal words paired with hazard and instruction statements.

The results showed that participants rated warning statements containing hazard and <b>instruction</b> <b>information</b> paired with the signal word “DEADLY ” significantly higher on intended carefulness than the same statements paired with the signal word “DANGER. ” Statements paired with a signal word were rated higher than statements without a signal word. Overall, {{the pattern of the}} ratings for the printed statements in this study concurs with that of Barzegar’s and Wogalter (2000) voice warning data.

40|$|Library and {{information}} studies (LIS) programs have commonly used the terms bibliographic <b>instruction,</b> <b>information</b> literacy, and user education interchangeably for courses on instruction.

The article discusses {{the implications of these}} developments and reiterates that user instruction alone provides learners only with the lower-level aspects of information literacy.
