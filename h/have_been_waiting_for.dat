Similarly, Alex Lai from Contactmusic.com commented on the [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sassy" [...] track, saying that it, and the album's fourth single [...] "Take Me on the Floor", [...] "could fill dance floors", but {{he noted that the}} latter made for [...] "stale listening". David James Young, from Sputnikmusic, felt it was the best song on the album, [...] "the best thing about this song is how damn {{infectious}} it is, thus making it an excellent pop song with top harmonies and a synth hook". Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that it [...] "has the kind of breathless, carnivorous sexuality that Madonna still keeps trying to convince us she has", but it wasn't [...] "the sexual awakening that most <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> [...] to have". For its lyrics, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] "sacrifice lyrical clarity {{for the sake of a}} good hook".|$|E
500|$|As {{her time}} on the show was nearing its end, it was {{announced}} that DeGarmo was to debut a country ballad song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye". Kelly Ballhorn of Ryanseacrest.com noted that: [...] "Fans of 'Young and the Restless' and Diana <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> her to sing on the show like she can in real life... well, the wait’s over". [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] was co-written by DeGarmo and her real-life fiance Ace Young, who was also a competitor on American Idol, and details Angelina's [...] "emotional journey" [...] on the show. She was approached by the show's award-winning composer David Kurtz, and he asked her to make a song for Angelina. Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said: [...] "It’s supposed to be a turning point to her character. Her character on the most part has been pushy and full of herself." [...] During an interview with TV Guide, DeGarmo said that the song will [...] "tug at your heartstrings" [...] and marks a big turning point for Angelina's storyline: [...] "where she's finally starting to grow up. She's coming to realize that she needs to get rid of her selfish ways. She doesn't know how to go about that like a normal person, so she does it through song." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Anymore" [...] {{received}} a mixed to positive response from music critics. Several critics {{noted that the}} track serves as a strong opener for Silver Eye. David Chiu from Consequence of Sound described the song as an [...] "outstanding opening track" [...] for [...] "fans who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Goldfrapp to somehow {{get back to their}} dance club roots". Agreeing, Daryl Easlea, writing for Record Collector, labelled it as the [...] "perfect opener". In the album review for Silver Eye, AllMusic's Heather Phares claimed that [...] "Anymore" [...] was a [...] "quintessential" [...] track and noted how the duo tends to open their albums in similar manners. A group of critics from PopMatters reviewed the recording in their [...] "Singles Going Steady" [...] column; Adriane Pontecorvo from the publication stated that although it [...] "isn't breaking any barrier", it [...] "makes no apologies" [...] and [...] "promises a good time". Chris Ingalls thought similarly and said, [...] "'Anymore' won't change your life, but it'll get stuck in your head {{for the better part of}} the morning". And finally, Andrew Paschal was more mixed to the track, awarding it five out of ten stars, and claiming that the track is [...] "fun" [...] but overall found it to be too predictable.|$|E

She has been called [...] "intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive" [...] by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work and believe in what we're doing."

500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush was {{complimentary}} of Lewis's vocals, {{writing that}} she sounds [...] "appealing and captivating," [...] {{and continued to}} say that it is what her fans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> Sciarretto gave [...] "Collide" [...] a rating of three out of a possible five stars. Lewis Corner for Digital Spy praised the song, writing that Lewis combined her ability to deliver power ballad lyrics into a dance orientated song. Corner compared the song to Katy Perry's [...] "Firework", also produced by Sandy Vee; however, Corner noted that Lewis performs [...] "Collide" [...] in a way which distances the comparison. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust was critical of the song. Whilst she noted that Lewis was venturing into dance music, where artists such as David Guetta and Kylie Minogue have experienced great success, and that Lewis has an iconic voice compared to both, she felt that the delivery still lacked. St. Asaph wrote [...] "The lethargic, two-note verses make her voice sound less husky than bored, an emotion that a comeback single should never evoke." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian felt that the song seemed to build and drop at the wrong times, and that its structure was not cohesive. Cragg continued to say that Lewis does a [...] "passable job as a dance diva," [...] and noted the resemblances between [...] "Collide" [...] and [...] "Penguin".|$|E
