Harish Salve filed a {{contempt}} case against him in 2010, and the Supreme Court asked Bhushan to apologise. In response, Bhushan submitted an explanation stating why he felt those judges were corrupt. The Bhushans noted the difficulty of getting documentary evidence because judges are immune from investigation.

2500|$|Razack's {{report was}} {{submitted}} as an exhibit in the inquiry on December 13, {{the last day}} any documents could be submitted to the Canadian government's inquiry into the bombing. The following week, a request for evidence and documentation supporting Razack's argument was made to Raj Anand, the lawyer representing {{the families of the}} deceased. The lawyer refused to give these documents, calling the demand [...] "ironic" [...] since Razack's report on systemic racism was the only report whose validity was being questioned, and for which supporting evidence was requested, which Anand claimed was a result of systemic racism. The Department of Justice lawyer who made the request, Barnand Brukney, expressed his impression that racism had {{very little to do with}} how the Canadian government handled the Air India Flight 182, telling Razack in court that she [...] "really [...] know what happened in this case."

2500|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{violence}} found the property damage caused by the rioters and protesters in Addis Ababa and other cities totaled to 4.45 million Ethiopian Birr, including 190 damaged buses and 44 cars as police officers tried to restrain the rioters. The SBS journalist, Olivia Rousset, indicated that the government used too much force to subdue the rioters. She also said that [...] "stone-throwing rioters" [...] tried to take the guns from the security forces. Some EU observers have also shown their discontent at the post-election violence, suggesting that the police response was disproportionate, and blamed the government. In a rare response, Meles {{said that he was}} disappointed that [...] "some people have misunderstood the nature of the problem and misinterpreted it." [...] In its final report, the independent commission concluded that the aggressive steps taken by the police force were to [...] "avoid large scale violence and to protect the constitution" [...] and that the reason behind the riotings might have been the protestors' unfamiliarity with the [...] "process of democratization" [...] e.g., respecting election results. However, the commission also acknowledged that there were serious errors that needed to be addressed regarding the capabilities of the Ethiopian Security forces to control riots. However, three members of the Inquiry Commission have defected and given their testimonies to members of the U.S. Congress and the International Media. The <b>former</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>Judge</b> of the Southern Ethiopian nations and nationalities, Judge Frehiwot Samuel, who was also Chairman of the Inquiry Commission, and his Deputy, Judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, have fled Ethiopia with a video and final report of the Commission’s findings that shows the commission deciding, through an eight to two vote, that the government had used excessive force and that there were grave human rights violations. Some leaders, including the UK's Tony Blair, condemned the violence but repeated that Meles' ruling party [...] "won the election." [...] Other European organizations also praised the election saying it was a [...] "free and fair multi-party election." [...] So far, most of the US representatives have not changed their outlook and the US government supports the Ethiopian government in both military and aid assistance. Other analysts also described progress in Ethiopia's first multi-party parliament in history.|$|E
