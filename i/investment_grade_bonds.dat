Finally, we examine the driving factors behind fund performance. As well as examining the influence of several fund characteristics, particularly fund age, asset value under management and management fee, we investigate the impact of investment style on the funds' risk-adjusted performance.

5000|$|On February 2, 2012, at the Harbor Investment Conference, {{speaking}} {{to an audience}} of investors, Boaz Weinstein recommended buying the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Series 9 10-Year Index, CDX IG 9. This is a derivative that measures the spread (difference in interest rates) between the interest rates of investment-grade worthy companies and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This was a derivative which Weinstein had noticed to be losing value in a manner and to a degree which seemed to diverge from market expectations. It turned out that JPMorgan was shorting the index by making huge trades. JPMorgan's bet was that credit markets would strengthen; the index is based on 121 <b>investment</b> <b>grade</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by North American corporations. Investors who followed Weinstein's tip did poorly during the early months of 2012 as JPMorgan strongly supported its position.

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non <b>investment</b> <b>grade</b> <b>bonds</b> or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|E

40|$|Credit spread is {{the extra}} risk-reward that an {{investor}} is bearing for investing in corporate bonds instead of government bonds.

European corporate bond market is mostly ignored in corporate bond liquidity literature and this thesis’ purpose is to contribute to literature by being among the first papers to estimate liquidity determinants with comprehensive European corporate bond data, covering both investment grade and speculative grade rating categories. DATA The corporate bond data is from years 2005 – 2009 covering all credit ratings. Corporate bond pricing, rating, and descriptive data is obtained from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The sample consists of euro denominated corporate bonds with the amount outstanding more than 250 million euros for <b>investment</b> <b>grade</b> <b>bonds</b> and 100 million for speculative grade bonds. The total number of unique bonds is 2589 bonds, with the total number of bond-years amounting to 7073.

Liquidity measures bid-ask spread and percentage of zero return days are capturing the liquidity effect for <b>investment</b> <b>grade</b> <b>bonds</b> effectively.

The {{objective of the}} study is to investigate the minimum portfolio size at which the marginal benefits measured in terms of risk reduction or reward-to-risk improvement from additional diversification become very small. It is examined how such diversification benefits and minimum portfolio sizes vary when differentiating the investment opportunity sets by the sector of the issuer. Furthermore, the study investigates whether diversification benefits seem to have varied in different time periods in 2002 – 2010. The study also gives an overview of European bond markets and the characteristics of bonds as financial instruments and presents measures {{that can be used to}} evaluate portfolio performance and diversification benefits. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The bond sample is extracted from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Index System database. The data consists of monthly returns of bonds belonging to the Merrill Lynch Euro Broad Market Index. The data is collected from 01 / 2002 – 12 / 2010. Also bond-specific descriptive data on the bond sector and domicile of the issuer of the bond was collected. Three metrics are used in the study to examine diversification benefits. The measures used are excess standard deviation or mean derived deviation, Sharpe ratio and cross sectional kurtosis. The study was conducted by first completing the return data of the bonds, majority of which exiting the index during the period under review due to their time to maturity rolling below 1 year, into a table format with no empty observations. The same was repeated for the set of all bonds as well as for each sector and each time sub-period separately so as to allow sector- and time-specific examination. The study is implemented by selecting bonds randomly in order to create 1000 portfolios for each investment opportunity set and each portfolio size. A portfolio size ranging from 2 to 100 is examined for each set and the optimal portfolio size is thought to have been achieved when the marginal improvement in the measure decreases below 1 %. RESULTS The minimum portfolio size is found to vary by issuer type, time period under review and the metric used to measure the marginal benefits of further diversification. While the marginal benefits of further diversification are generally achieved with PSs of 25 - 55 bonds when using the mean derived deviation or Sharpe ratio as the criteria, the untapped benefits of full diversification are still sizeable. When examining the Sharpe ratio, with the optimal portfolio size the unrealized diversification benefits are still over 50 %. When using the MDD metric the overall diversification benefits range between 63 and 95 percent. When examining kurtosis the required portfolio size seems to be higher, mostly in the range of 55 to 80 bonds, at which overall diversification benefits are roughly 68 to 92 percent...|$|R
