40|$|For {{anterior}} correction and instrumentation of thoracic curves {{single rod}} techniques are widely used. Disadvantages {{of this technique}} include screw pullouts, rod fractures and limited control of kyphosis. This is a prospective study of 23 consecutive patients with idiopathic thoracic scoliosis treated with a new anterior <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> system. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new technique in the surgical treatment of idiopathic thoracic scoliosis. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the largest series on <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> dual screw instrumentation over the entire fusion length in thoracic scoliosis. Twenty-three patients with an average age of 15  years were surgically treated with a new anterior <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> system through a standard open double thoracotomy approach. Average clinical and radiological follow-up was 28  months (24 – 46  months). Fusion was carried out mostly from end-to-end vertebra. The primary curve was corrected from 66. 6 ° to 28. 3 ° (57. 5 % correction) with an average loss of correction of 2. 0 ° at Cobb levels and of 1. 3 ° at fusion levels. Spontaneous correction of the secondary lumbar curve averaged 43. 2 % (preoperative Cobb angle 41. 2 °). The apical vertebral rotation was corrected by 41. 1 % with a consecutive correction of the rib hump of clinically 66. 7 %. The thoracic kyphosis measured 29. 2 ° preoperatively and 33. 6 ° at follow-up. In seven patients with a preoperative hyperkyphosis of on average 47. 3 ° thoracic kyphosis was corrected to 41. 0 °. This new instrumentation enables an entire <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> instrumentation over the whole thoracic fusion length. It offers primary stability without the need of postoperative bracing.

This clinical study compared anterior <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> instrumentation with posterior pedicle screw fixation for idiopathic thoracic lordoscoliosis, including 42 patients (7 male, 35 female; average age 16  years, range 12 – 34) who underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation (n =  20) or anterior <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> instrumentation (n =  22) at two centers. The average follow-up period was 33  months (24 – 108  months). Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a structural thoracic curve (Lenke 1 – 3) and thoracic hypokyphosis (T 4 –T 12  <  20 °). The main thoracic curve magnitude and sagittal profile on standing radiographs were evaluated. Thoracic kyphosis was significantly restored from preoperatively 10. 2 ° to 23. 4 ° postoperatively in the anterior group and from 7. 6 ° to 12. 9 ° in the posterior group (P <  0. 005). Kyphosis improved significantly better in the anterior group than in the posterior group (P <  0. 005).

40|$|Abstract In this review, basic {{knowledge}} and recent innovation of surgical treatment for scoliosis will be described. Surgical treatment for scoliosis is indicated, in general, for the curve exceeding 45 or 50 degrees by the Cobb's method {{on the ground}} that: 1) Curves larger than 50 degrees progress even after skeletal maturity. 2) Curves of greater magnitude cause loss of pulmonary function, and much larger curves cause respiratory failure. 3) Larger the curve progress, more difficult to treat with surgery. Posterior fusion with instrumentation has been a standard of the surgical treatment for scoliosis. In modern instrumentation systems, more anchors are used to connect the rod and the spine, resulting in better correction and less frequent implant failures. Segmental pedicle screw constructs or hybrid constructs using pedicle screws, hooks, and wires are the trend of today. Anterior instrumentation surgery had been a choice of treatment for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis because better correction can be obtained with shorter fusion levels. Recently, superiority of anterior surgery for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis has been lost. Initial enthusiasm for anterior instrumentation for the thoracic curve using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique has faded out. Various attempts are being made with use of fusionless surgery. To control growth, epiphysiodesis on the convex side of the deformity with or without instrumentation is a technique to provide gradual progressive correction and to arrest {{the deterioration of the}} curves. To avoid fusion for skeletally immature children with spinal cord injury or myelodysplasia, vertebral wedge ostetomies are performed for the treatment of progressive paralytic scoliosis. For right thoracic curve with idiopathic scoliosis, multiple vertebral wedge osteotomies without fusion are performed. To provide correction and maintain it during the growing years while allowing spinal growth for early onset scoliosis, technique of instrumentation without fusion or with limited fusion using <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> instrumentation has been developed.

Magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) is lengthened noninvasively using a hand-held magnetic external remote controller in a physician office; however, the MCGR implant is expensive, and the cumulative cost savings {{have not been}} well studied. We compared direct medical costs of MCGR and TGR for EOS from the US integrated health care delivery system perspective. We hypothesized that over time, the MCGR implant cost will be offset by eliminating repeated TGR surgical lengthenings. Methods: For both TGR and MCGR, the economic model estimated the cumulative costs for initial implantation, lengthenings, revisions due to device failure, surgical-site infections, device exchanges (at 3. 8  years), and final fusion, over a 6 -year episode of care. Model parameters were estimated from published literature, a multicenter EOS database of US institutions, and interviews. Costs were discounted at 3. 0 % annually and represent 2015 US dollars. Results: Of 1, 000 simulated patients over 6  years, MCGR was associated with an estimated 270 fewer deep surgical-site infections and 197 fewer revisions due to device failure compared with TGR. MCGR was projected to cost an additional $ 61 per patient over the 6 -year episode of care compared with TGR. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were sensitive {{to changes in the}} percentage of MCGR <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> use, months between TGR lengthenings, percentage of hospital inpatient (vs outpatient) TGR lengthenings, and MCGR implant cost.

40|$|Concurrent Session 4 B: Innovatiove Methods - Paper no. 75 SUMMARY: Growth-sparing {{techniques}} {{are commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} progressive EOS. The standard growing rod (GR) technique requires multiple surgeries for lengthening. The preliminary results of MCGR has shown the comparable outcomes to standard GR without the need for repeated surgery which can be expected to reduce the overall complication rate in GR surgery. INTRODUCTION: Growing rod technique (GR) has been a viable alternative for the treatment of progressive early onset scoliosis (EOS). However, a high complication rate associated with GR has been attributed to frequent surgeries required for lengthening. The safety and efficacy of a non-invasive Magnetically Controlled Growing Rod (MCGR) has been previously reported in a porcine model. We are reporting the preliminary clinical results of the use of this device. METHODS: Multicenter prospective review of early clinical and radiographic data of EOS patients underwent MCGR surgery. Patients who had at least 3 distractions were included. The technique was not significantly different from standard GR surgery. Distractions were performed in clinic without anesthesia or analgesics. The “Target” length (the intended distraction amount in mm which is set on the external magnet) and “Achieved” length (The distraction measured in mm on post distraction radiograph) were also recorded for each distraction. RESULTS: Patients (N= 14, F= 7,M= 7) had mean age of 8 y 10 m (3 y 6 m to 12 y 7 m) and underwent 14 index surgeries, single rod (SR) in 5, <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> (DR) in 9 and 68 distractions. Diagnosis was idiopathic 5, neuromuscular 4, congenital 2, syndromic 2 and NF one. Mean FU was 9 months (4 - 15). Average distraction achieved was 4. 2 mm per patient. The average time between index surgery and the first distraction was 66 days (28 - 185) and thereafter was 43 days (23 - 184). Complications included superficial infection in 1 (SR), prominent implant in 1 (DR) and minimal loss of initial length in 3 (21 %) index surgery (all SR). Partial loss of distraction was observed following 14 of the 68 distractions (1 in DR, 13 SR). This loss was regained in subsequent distractions. There was no neurologic deficit or implant failure.

40|$|Introduction: Surgical {{treatments}} for early onset scoliosis typically require multiple operations and many complications. A more flexible growing rod construct {{might result in}} a more flexible spine with fewer complications.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine changes in spine ROM after implantation of simulated growing rod constructs with a range of clinically relevant structural properties. Methods: Biomechanical tests were conducted on six skeletally immature porcine thoracic spines (domestic pigs, age 2 – 4 months, 35 – 40 kg, T 1 –T 13). Paired pedicle screws were inserted into T 3 and T 4 proximally, and T 10 and T 11 distally. Specimens were tested under the following conditions: (i) control, then <b>dual</b> <b>rods</b> of (ii) PEEK (6. 25 mm, n = 6), (3) titanium (4 mm, n = 6), and (4) CoCr alloy (5 mm, n = 4).

ROM for the treated region was determined by averaging all maximum side-to-side rotations at each instrumented level. Differences were determined by t-tests and Bonferroni posthoc.

40|$|Power-scaling of diode-pumped single-frequency {{solid-state}} lasers {{has been}} hindered by strong thermal effects which can degrade beam quality, and often make {{the selection of}} a single-axial-mode difficult. A further problem is that changes in cavity length due to temperature fluctuations become more pronounced at high pump powers leading to mode-hopping. The latter problem can be eliminated by employing frequency selective components intracavity and by active stabilisation of the cavity length to an external reference cavity, but at the expense of considerable increase in complexity and cost. Here we report an efficient diode-end-pumped Nd:YLF master oscillator and power amplifier (MOPA), with > 15 W of reliable single-frequency output in a beam with M 2 < 1. 1 at 1. 053 µm. Our design exploits the weak thermal lensing behaviour on the lower gain o-polarisation to avoid degradation in beam quality, and utilizes a simple passive technique to suppress axial-mode-hopping in the master oscillator. The master-oscillator employed a bow-tie ring cavity with a Faraday rotator and half-wave plates to enforce unidirectional and hence single-frequency operation. The cavity also included a Brewster-angle lithium triborate (LBO) frequency doubling crystal maintained at ~ 162 °C for non-critical phase-matching at 1. 053 µm. The cavity was designed to efficiently out-couple the fundamental by using a mirror with 10 % at 1. 053 µm, with only a small loss in efficiency due to intracavity second harmonic generation. The nonlinear loss experienced by adjacent (non-lasing) axial modes due to sum-frequency generation with the oscillating mode is approximately twice that experienced by the oscillating mode due to second harmonic generation. The net result is that that mode-hopping is suppressed and the lasing frequency can be tuned continuously (mode-hop-free) over many axial-mode-spacings by simply adjusting the cavity length. The master-oscillator was end-pumped by a beam-shaped diode-bar and produced 5 W of single-frequency output at 1. 053 µm in a beam with M 2 < 1. 1. By adjustment of the cavity length continuous mode-hop-free tuning of the fundamental by over 8 GHz, corresponding to ~ 14 axial mode-spacings could be achieved. Thus, under free-running operation the laser could be operated single-frequency (mode-hop-free) for very long periods of time without the need of cavity length adjustment. To increase the power further a <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> diode-end-pumped Nd:YLF double-pass amplifier scheme was employed. The two Nd:YLF rods were rotated by 90 ° relative to each other to compensate for astigmatism, and had low Nd concentrations (~ 0. 5 %), to minimise energy-transfer-upconversion and its deleterious effects on gain and beam quality. With 45. 5 W of incident diode power the amplifier had a small signal gain of ~ 50 and produced 15. 5 W of output for ~ 5 W input from the master-oscillator in a diffraction-limited beam with M 2 < 1. 1. The relatively high optical-to-optical efficiency of this MOPA approach and the absence of any degradation in beam quality indicates that further power-scaling via the use of additional amplifiers should be easily achievable. <br/...|$|E

RESULTS: Patients (N= 14; 7 F and 7 M) had a mean age of 8 y+ 10 m (3 y+ 6 m to 12 y+ 7 m) and underwent a total of 14 index surgeries (SR: index single rod in 5 and DR: <b>dual</b> <b>rod</b> in 9) and 91 distractions. There were 5 idiopathic, 4 neuromuscular, 2 congenital, 2 syndromic and one NF. Mean follow-up (FU) was 10 months (5. 8 - 18. 2). Mean Cobb changed from 57 ° pre-op to 35 ° post-op and correction was maintained (35 °) at latest FU. T 1 -T 12 increased by 4 mm for SR and 10 mm for DR with mean monthly gain of 0. 5 and 1. 39, respectively. T 1 -S 1 gain was 4 mm for SR and 17 mm for DR with mean monthly gain of 0. 5 mm for SR and 2. 35 mm for DR. The mean interval between index surgery and the first distraction was 66 days and thereafter was 43 days. Complications included one superficial infection in (SR), one prominent implant (DR) and minimal loss of initial distraction in three after index MCGR (all SR). Overall, partial loss of distraction was observed following 14 of the 91 distractions (one DR and 13 SR). This loss was regained in subsequent distractions. There was no neurologic deficit or implant failure. CONCLUSION: MCGR appears to be safe and provided adequate distraction similar to the standard GR technique without the need for repeated surgeries. DR patients had better initial curve correction and greater spinal height. No major complications were observed during the short follow-up period.

40|$|Managing spinal {{deformities}} {{in young}} children is challenging, particularly early onset scoliosis (EOS).

5000|$|The first Guild {{workshop}} {{was located}} in Manhattan, New York, where Dronge (who soon took over full ownership) focused on archtop jazz guitars, both electric and acoustic. Rapid expansion forced the company to move to much larger quarters, on Newark St. in Hoboken, New Jersey, in the old R. Neumann Leathers building. The advent of the folk music craze in the early '60s had shifted the company into production of an important line of acoustic folk and blues guitars, including a dreadnought series (D-40, D-50 and, later, D-55) that competed successfully with Martin's D-18 and D-28 models, and jumbo and Grand Concert [...] "F" [...] models that were particularly popular with blues guitarists like Dave Van Ronk.

40|$|Abstract Background Surgical {{treatments}} for early onset scoliosis (EOS) correct curvatures and improve respiratory function but involve many complications. A distractible, or ‘growing rod,’ implant construct {{that is more}} flexible than current metal rod systems may sufficiently correct curves in small children and reduce complications due to biomechanical factors. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine}} ranges of motion (ROM) after implantation of simulated growing rod constructs with a range of clinically relevant structural properties. The hypothesis was that ROM of spines instrumented with polymer rods would be greater than conventional metal rods and lower than non-instrumented controls. Methods Biomechanical tests were conducted on six thoracic spines from skeletally immature domestic swines (35 – 40  kg). Paired pedicle screws were used as anchors at proximal and distal levels. Specimens were tested under the following conditions: control, then <b>dual</b> <b>rods</b> of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) (diameter 6. 25  mm), titanium (4  mm), and cobalt-chrome alloy (CoCr) (5  mm). Lateral bending (LB) and flexion-extension (FE) moments were applied, and vertebral rotations were measured. Differences were determined by two-tailed t-tests and Bonferroni for four primary comparisons: PEEK vs control and PEEK vs CoCr, in LB and FE (α[*]=[*] 0. 05 / 4). Results In LB, ROM of spine segments after instrumenting with PEEK rods was lower than the non-instrumented control condition at each instrumented level. ROM was greater with PEEK rods than with Ti and CoCr rods at every instrumented level. Combining treated levels, in LB, ROM for PEEK rods was 35  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and 270  % of CoCr rods (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In FE, ROM with PEEK was 27  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 180  % of CoCr (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). At proximal and distal adjacent non-instrumented levels in FE, mean ROM was lower for PEEK than for either metal. Conclusions PEEK rods increased flexibility versus metal rods, and decreased flexibility versus non-instrumented controls, both over the entire instrumented segment and at each individual level. Smaller mean increases in ROM at proximal and distal adjacent motion segments occurred with PEEK compared to metal rods, which may help decrease complications, such as junctional kyphosis. Flexible growing rods may eventually help improve treatment options for young patients with severe deformity...|$|R
40|$|To enhance fuel {{safety and}} to achieve a power uprating, a new concept PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) fuel, which is called a <b>dual</b> cooled fuel <b>rod,</b> has been studied since 2007. Although there are some {{challenging}} problems about each mechanical component, fuel rod supporting structures are especially dealt within this paper. In the dual-cooled annular fuel rod, an inner flow passage {{as well as an}} outer one is used not only to enhance the fuel safety but to achieve a power uprating through the decreasing fuel center temperature and increasing the heat transfer area between fuel and coolant. As a result, the diameter of dual-cooled fuel rods becomes 1. 6 times bigger than a conventional solid fuel rod and the gap between the annular fuel and the spacer grid’s straps is narrowed. This is a current key issue of fuel rod supports. To accommodate the narrowed gap, spacer grids, such as the cantilever type, hemi-sphere type, circular insertion type, etc., were suggested. For some of these configurations, patents have been applied. The grid springs in a spacer grid play the role of holding the fuel rods in an appropriate position and preventing fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation. In the case of the <b>dual</b> cooled fuel <b>rod,</b> the total mass is increased. So, the stiffness of a grid spring has to be increased more than that of a conventional grid spring. However, if the stiffnesses of springs are increased too much, fuel rods can bend due to the prohibition of their axial slip. So, it is necessary to design an appropriate stiffness. In this paper, the minimum spring force to prevent dual-cooled fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation is calculated. The spring characteristics of a cantilever type and a hemi-sphere type are predicted. A finite element analysis is carried out by using the commercial code ABAQUS. The analysis results are verified by experiments. Finally, it is checked whether the property of the suggested springs satisfies the minimum required spring force. Based on the obtained results, a kind of spacer grid candidate for <b>dual</b> cooled fuel <b>rods,</b> i. e. a spacer grid with hybrid supports is suggested...|$|R
5000|$|The Rickenbacker 330 {{is part of}} Rickenbacker's 300 {{series of}} guitars, the series for which Rickenbacker is perhaps best known.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Managing spinal {{deformities}} {{in young}} children is challenging, particularly early onset scoliosis (EOS). Surgical intervention is often required if EOS has been unresponsive to conservative treatment particularly with rapidly progressive curves. An emerging treatment option for EOS is fusionless scoliosis surgery. Similar to bracing, this surgical option potentially harnesses growth, motion and function of the spine along with correcting spinal deformity. <b>Dual</b> growing <b>rods</b> are one such fusionless treatment, which aims to modulate growth of the vertebrae. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the extent to which semiconstrained growing rods (Medtronic, Sofamor, Danek, Memphis, TN) with a telescopic sleeve component, reduce rotational constraint on the spine compared with standard "constrained / rigid" rods and hence potentially provide a more physiological mechanical environment for the growing spine. METHODS Six 40 - 60 kg English Large White porcine spines served as a model for the paediatric human spine. Each spine was dissected into a 7 level thoracolumbar multi-segment unit (MSU), removing all non-ligamentous soft tissues and leaving 3 cm of ribs either side. Pure nondestructive axial rotation moments of ± 4 Nm at a constant rotation rate of 8 deg. s- 1 were applied to the mounted MSU spines using a biaxial Instron testing machine. Displacement of each vertebral level was captured using a 3 D motion tracking system (Optotrak 3020, Northern Digital Inc, Waterloo, ON). Each spine was tested in an un-instrumented state first and then with appropriately sized semi-constrained growing rods and rigid rods in alternating sequence. The rods were secured by multi-axial pedicle screws (Medtronic CD Horizon) at levels 2 and 6 of the construct. The range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ) size and stiffness (Nm. deg- 1) were calculated from the Instron load-displacement data and intervertebral ROM was calculated through a MATLAB algorithm from Optotrak data. RESULTS Irrespective of the order of testing, rigid rods significantly reduced the total ROM compared with semi-constrained rods (p< 0. 05) with in a significantly stiffer spine for both left and right axial rotation (p< 0. 05). Analysing the intervertebral motion within the instrumented levels 2 - 6, rigid rods showed reduced ROM compared with semi-constrained growing rods and compared with un-instrumented motion segments. CONCLUSION Semi-constrained growing rods maintain similar stiffness in axial rotation to un-instrumented spines, while <b>dual</b> rigid <b>rods</b> significantly reduce axial rotation. Clinically the effect of semi-constrained growing rods as observed in this study is that they would be expected to allow growth via the telescopic rod components while maintaining the axial flexibility of the spine, which may reduce occurrence of the crankshaft phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The dual {{function}} of a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) rod working as the near-surface mounted (NSM) strengthening and impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) anode for corroded reinforced concrete structures has been proposed and researched.

After a period of ICCP operation at high current density, the beams were subjected to flexural testing to determine the load–deflection relationships. The potential decays of the steel met recognised ICCP standards, and the CFRP remained effective in strengthening the corroded reinforced concrete beams.
