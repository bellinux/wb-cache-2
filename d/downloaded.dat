5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. <b>Downloaded</b> singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were <b>downloaded</b> in 2005; a further 825,000 were <b>downloaded</b> during the first three months of 2006.|$|E

40|$|In {{a highly}} mobile and {{networked}} society {{the need to}} <b>download</b> large amounts of data on a mobile network is inevitable. This thesis analyzes the predictability of <b>download</b> speeds in mobile networks {{to be able to}} schedule <b>downloads</b> while in areas with high <b>download</b> speeds. This decreases the <b>download</b> time and thus the energy wasted <b>downloading.</b> The data analyzed is from Bredbandskollen. We find that in areas of 200 x 200 meters the <b>download</b> speed is easiest to predict due to a low covariance. We also find that areas with high average <b>download</b> speed {{are more likely to have}} neighboring areas with similar <b>download</b> speed than areas with low average <b>download</b> speed, making it easier to predict the <b>download</b> speed when moving between such locations. Finally, we show paths in urban areas where a user can move long distances and experience similar <b>download</b> speeds...|$|R

50|$|A <b>download</b> {{manager is}} a {{computer}} program dedicated {{to the task of}} <b>downloading</b> (and sometimes uploading) possibly unrelated stand-alone files from (and sometimes to) the Internet for storage. Some <b>download</b> managers {{can also be used to}} accelerate <b>download</b> speeds by <b>downloading</b> from multiple sources at once. Although web browsers may have <b>download</b> managers incorporated as a feature, they are differentiated by the fact that they do not prioritize accurate, complete and unbroken <b>downloads</b> of information. While some <b>download</b> managers are fully fledged programs dedicated to <b>downloading</b> any information over one or more protocols (e.g. http), many are integrated into installers or update managers and used to <b>download</b> parts of a specific program (or set of programs), examples include Google and Adobe's update managers.|$|R
