5000|$|On November 18, 2013, Ion Television began {{carrying}} the Home Shopping Network via a sixth digital subchannel {{on most of}} its owned-and-operated stations, {{as part of a}} partnership with Ion Media Networks (both once controlled by Lowell [...] "Bud" [...] Paxson) to expand the channel's broadcast coverage. Although it has a high definition simulcast feed, HSN is transmitted by Ion stations in standard definition, due to the same <b>digital</b> <b>multiplexing</b> limitations that prevent QVC from being carried in 16:9 SD or HD. HSN has been widely available over-the-air throughout the United States since its inception - through stations that the network had owned prior to the 1998 reorganization of its Silver King Broadcasting group into USA Broadcasting (some of which were converted into general entertainment independent outlets, and were later sold to Univision Communications to form the charter stations of the present-day UniMÃ¡s network), and had been mainly available on low-power television stations immediately prior to its subchannel-leasing agreement with Ion; HSN is carried on low-power stations in some markets where an Ion station also carries the network, though HSN's programming is exclusive to an existing affiliate in a few areas where both networks are present (such as Atlanta, where WPXA-TV simulcasts Telemundo affiliate WKTB-CD on its DT6 subchannel under a time-leasing arrangement, and W45DX-D carries HSN).|$|E

50|$|In {{entertainment}} and architectural installations, systems integrators {{function as a}} designer/engineer, bringing together {{a wide array of}} components from various manufacturers to accomplish the goal of creating a unified, functioning system that meets the needs of the client. Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various OEMs to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects. The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed. Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design. As lighting and A/V systems increase in their level of sophistication, and the number of manufacturers for components of these systems increases, so does the demand for systems integrators. Common data protocols involved in {{entertainment and}} architectural systems are <b>Digital</b> <b>Multiplexing</b> (or DMX512-A), Remote Device Management (or RDM), Art-Net, ACN or sACN (Streaming Architecture for Control Networks), Analog, and various proprietary control software from a variety of manufacturers. Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations. The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access. The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles). This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes. For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server. The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality. A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.|$|E

Instead of using the conversional time-division analog-modulation method, the technique of <b>digital</b> <b>multiplexing</b> is applied {{to increase the number}} of signal channels to four. Detailed design considerations and functional allocation of the system is discussed. The front-end unit is early designed to condition the input signal in an optimal manner. Then, the micro controller handled the tasks of data conversion, wireless transmission, as well as providing the ability of simple preprocessing such as waveform averaging or rectification.

30|$|In both {{scenarios}} {{considered in}} this paper, {{in the primary}} systemâDVB-T broadcast system on the one hand, IEEE 802.11 a/g networks on the otherâthe signal is modulated using Orthogonal Frequency <b>Digital</b> <b>Multiplexing</b> (OFDM); see, for example, [16]. The OFDM signal is a compound signal consisting of multiple frequency carriers, also called subcarriers or tones, that are each modulated in phase or in phase and amplitude. From a practical outlook, the modulated tones are multiplexed at the transmitter using an inverse FFT. Conversely, the subcarriers are de-multiplexed at the receiver end by an FFT. The size of the FFT N, which defines that of the OFDM symbols, depends on the system. In the case of IEEE 802.11 a/g systems, 64 subcarriers are used whereas the DVB-T signal uses 1024, 2048, 4096, or 8192 tones. In order to avoid intersymbol interference, a Guard Interval (GI) is introduced. In the case of OFDM, this GI is designed as {{a copy of the}} last samples of the OFDM symbol. This approach provides the symbol with a cyclic nature which simplifies the receiver. For this reason, this D long GI is called the Cyclic Prefix (CP).|$|E
40|$|Size {{and cost}} of a {{switched}} mode power supply can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency. The maximum switching frequency and the maximum conversion ratio are limited by the duty cycle of a PWM signal. In DCDC converters, a sawtooth generator is the fundamental circuit block to generate the PWM signal. The presented PWM generator is based on two parallel, fully interleaved PWM generator stages, each containing an integrator based sawtooth generator and two 3 -stage highspeed comparators. A <b>digital</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of the PWM signals of each stage eliminates the dependency of the minimum on-time on the large reset times of the sawtooth ramps. A separation of the references of the PWM comparators in both stage allows to configure the PWM generator for a DCDC converter operating in fixed frequency or in constant on-time mode, which requires an operation in a wide frequency range. The PWM generator was fabricated in an 180 nm HV BiCMOS technology, {{as part of a}} DCDC converter. Measurements confirm minimum possible ontime pulses as short as 2 ns and thus allows switching frequencies of DCDC converters of > 50 MHz at small duty cycle of < 10 %. At moderate duty cycles switching frequencies up to 100 MHz are possible...|$|E
