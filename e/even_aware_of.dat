5|$|I think I can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both Latinos and Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn't <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of.</b> And, you know, if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E
5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|E
25|$|As {{minister}} for War, he {{became involved in}} disputes with Foreign Secretary George Canning over the Walcheren Expedition and its failure. Canning {{saw it as a}} diversion of troops from the Peninsular War based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother General Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the Earl of Chatham to command the expedition. The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Wellesley himself was neither complicit with nor <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the arrangement, but Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it became possible.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2010, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Lavelle posthumously {{for promotion}} {{back to the}} grade of general on the Air Force retired list {{in light of the}} release of declassified information that showed that Lavelle had been authorized by President Richard Nixon to conduct the bombing missions. Further, the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records found no evidence Lavelle caused, either directly or indirectly, the falsification of records, or that he was <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their existence. Once he learned of the reports, Lavelle took action to ensure the practice was discontinued. The nomination to restore his four-star rank was recommended by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force. However, the Senate Armed Services Committee declined to vote on the nomination, allowing it to expire without action {{at the end of the}} legislative session.|$|E

25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time in what she {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she could have ever thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology {{states that}} a [...] "National Museum" [...] (it does not specify which one) {{acquired}} specimens {{collected by the}} expedition and the New York Times purchased some of its photographs. Hubbard's book Mission into Time states that the expedition's underwater films and specimens [...] "provided the Hydrographic Office and the University of Michigan with invaluable data for the furtherance of their research." [...] However, Hubbard's unofficial biographer Russell Miller reports that the New York Times [...] "hold no photographs from the expedition, [...] no evidence that it was ever intended to buy such photographs, nor indeed any indication that the newspaper was <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the expedition's existence," [...] and that neither the U.S. Hydrographic Office nor the University of Michigan has any record of films or specimens from the expedition.|$|E
500|$|Just after Day's 21st {{birthday}} in June 1769, he and John Bicknell travelled to the Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital {{to choose the}} first girl for his experiment. Sabrina was 12 {{years old at the}} time, described as [...] "a clear auburn brunette, with darker eyes more glowing bloom and chestnut tresses". She was slender, and had long eyelashes and a pleasant voice. Day was struggling to choose a girl for the experiment, and Bicknell quickly picked her out. The pair did not tell the orphanage secretary, Samuel Magee, about the planned experiment. Instead they told him that she was to be indentured as a servant at Edgeworth's country house in Berkshire, waiving the £4 (...) fee they would have received for the apprenticeship. In line with the orphanage's requirements that responsibility be held by a married man, Edgeworth would be legally accountable for Sabrina, despite him not being present nor <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the arrangement.|$|E

500|$|The Samajwadi Party {{government}} {{said in a}} statement that Nagpal was suspended for demolishing a mosque's wall and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav justified the order saying that Nagpal's actions [...] "lacked foresight and disturbed communal harmony" [...] and she was suspended due to [...] "administrative compulsion to ease communal tension". This was later refuted by reports that the area had not reported any communal tension. The Station Officer of Rabupura police station said that since the demolition took place in night, most residents were not <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the incident. The demolition was reportedly executed in compliance to Supreme Court orders forbidding construction of illegal religious structures on public land. The court, in a judgement passed in 2009 had ruled that [...] "no new temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras can be constructed on public parks, public streets and public spaces" [...] and [...] "the ban must be enforced even if it gave rise to a law and order problem." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Stiles won {{the role}} of [...] "hapless janitor" [...] Lewis Kiniski. Despite being well known for his role on the British improve show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Stiles still {{had to go through}} the {{audition}} process along with everybody else. He said, [...] "I don't even think Drew was really <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Whose Line at that time because it hadn't been on the air (in the U.S.) that many years. I think it was only on Comedy Central at that time." [...] Stiles admitted that he liked to have fun with his character and not psychoanalyze him. Following his appearance in The Beverly Hillbillies, Diedrich Bader realised he needed a regular income and decided to return to television. He tested out for The Drew Carey Show, but did not initially want to be cast in it. He told Kevin Smith that he wanted to drive up his price for the pilot of Partners. Bader lost out on {{the role of}} Bob to Jon Cryer and then learned The Drew Carey Show wanted to hire him to play Oswald Lee Harvey.|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are <b>even</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{outrageous}} Dada eruption to date transpired at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. The Dadaist saw the Indépendants as decisive in {{the push to}} the top of the avant-garde food chain of the Parisian art scene.

A group guided by Tzara distributed flyers and posters saying that Charlie Chaplin would appear [...] "in the flesh" [...] on February 5.
