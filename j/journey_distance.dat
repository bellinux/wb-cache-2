5000|$|Hong Kong {{franchised}} bus routes have a fixed path, fare, service {{hours and}} schedule. Urban routes mostly operate with double-decker buses, {{which have become}} a distinguishing feature of Hong Kong. Passengers are required to pay their bus fare when they board the bus, and all buses accept payment by either Octopus card or cash; however no change is given for paying by the latter. [...] Some routes such as cross-harbour routes and Disneyland Resort routes are operated jointly by two companies. Fares are distanced-based although longer distances are comparatively cheaper than shorter distance fares on a per km basis. Hong Kong's bus fare system is based on where a passenger boards, e.g., [...] "tap on" [...] but not where a passenger alights, e.g., [...] "tap off".

5000|$|Alan Bate writes, [...] "The record {{criteria}} requires &#91;sic&#93; {{the rider}} to cover 28,970 kilometers by bike, in an East to West or West to East direction, wavering {{no more than}} 5 degrees off course. The total <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> must be a minimum of 40,075 kilometers, to include all transit by flight or sea. The ride must start and finish {{in the same place}} and must pass at least two antipodal points (these are two points that line up through the earth's centre). When the rider reaches a transit point to connect with a flight or boat to the next continent or country start point, the clock stops with regard to the actual riding time *(no longer the case any more since the rules have changed in relation to transit time, which is NOW included in the total time). As most of the earth's surface is water, this is unavoidable and fair as it applies to all athletes attempting the record. Once customs is cleared at the next destination, the clock immediately starts again. The same bicycle must be used throughout the attempt, although repairs and replacement parts and bikes are allowed for mechanical failure. Satellite tracking is highly recommended by Guinness World Records and a daily log, signatures of dignitaries and photographs at strategic points must be collated as evidence." ...|$|E

40|$|A hybrid {{electric}} vehicle is one which utilises both an internal combustion engine and electric motor for propulsion. This combination of power sources make its optimal control difficult. To enable optimised control of a hybrid electric powertrain it is desirable to have a priori knowledge of the characteristics for a given journey. Unfortunately this information is only known upon {{the completion of the}} journey and therefore it has to be intelligently estimated. This paper presents work that explores the possibility of prediction of Journey characteristics upon Journey departure.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the influence of socio-demographic and contextual variables on the multimodal character of public transit journeys. Accounting for multimodality in public transit journeys is important from a demand modeling point of view, especially in the assessment of new projected public transit infrastructure. To meet the objective, data from the national household travel survey of Flanders (Belgium) is analyzed. Based on 2, 202 public transit journeys, the main public transit mode choice (bus/tram/metro or train) and access/egress mode choice are simultaneously estimated using a multinomial logit model, and by explicitly making a distinction between unimodal and multimodal transit journeys. The results indicate that various socio-demographical (e. g. age, gender, level of education, household income) and contextual factors (e. g. <b>journey</b> <b>distance,</b> journey motive, urbanization degree, car availability) significantly influence the joint decision process. Total <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> and car availability are identified as the most important explanatory variables. In terms of model performance, the model appears to yield satisfactory predictions, justifying the integration of the model in more general demand modeling frameworks. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a concept for spacecraft propulsion {{by means of}} an energetic ion beam, with the ion source fixed at the spacecraft starting point (e. g., a lunar-based ion beam generator) and not onboard the vessel. This approach avoids the substantial mass penalty associated with the onboard ion source and power supply hardware, and vastly more energetic ion beam systems can be entertained. We estimate the ion beam parameters required for various scenarios, and consider some of the constraints limiting the concept. We find that the "ion beam sail' approach can be viable and attractive for <b>journey</b> <b>distances</b> not too great, for example within the Earth-Moon system, and could potentially provide support for journeys to the inner planets...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 7812 Over {{the last}} decade the Greater Dublin Area has {{witnessed}} significant land use and spatial restructuring. This has forced a distinct change in the spatial organisation of the built environment. Dublin has been transformed from an essentially monocentric city to a more dispersed polycentric city and this {{has created a new}} more complex geography of trip making. This research examines the impact of these changes on the <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> and journey time efficiency of urban travel patterns. This is achieved through the construction of urban travel scales for analysing daily travel patterns. Each travel scale consists of four variables: the average minimum travel cost, the average actual travel cost, the average random travel cost and the average maximum travel cost. The transportation problem of linear programming was used to solve for a theoretical minimum and maximum average travel cost while the Hit-and-Run algorithm was used to simulate average random travel costs for the study area. The scales were constructed for the 2001 peak and off-peak; in order for a temporal analysis to be completed, they were constructed for the 1991 peak and off-peak periods also. Four evaluation measures were derived from the scales to assess the efficiency of trip making. The research found that there is a large difference between the amount of travel required by the minimum solution and the amount that occurs in reality. This implies that significant opportunities exist to reduce the average <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> and average journey time if more individuals could be encouraged to travel to nearby destination opportunities. The results also found that car users have the potential to minimise <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> to a greater extent when using the public transport network than public transport users themselves...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION This {{working paper}} {{presents}} {{the findings of}} research aimed at assessing differences {{in the value of}} time by market segment. It draws on findings presented in AHCGâ€™s final report to DETR (AHCG, 1996) and previous research conducted {{during the course of this}} research contract (Bates and Whelan, 2001) and it is intended that this document be read in conjunction with those two reports. The paper describes the estimation of a base model for each journey-purpose (business, commuting and other) and shows how each is influenced by: income, <b>journey</b> <b>distance,</b> cost reimbursement, congestion, vehicle occupancy, trip sub-purpose, occupation, age group, gender, household type, â€˜free timeâ€™, respondent type, time constraints and geographical region. The findings of this analysis are then drawn together to develop a final set of models that allow the value of time to vary across a range of market segments. All models are estimated using GAUSS (Aptech Systems) without taking account of the repeat observations nature of the stated preference data...|$|E

30|$|The idea of {{developing}} the Kra Canal is most welcome by shipping practitioners because of the substantial amount of cost savings, its high level of safety and security, and reduction in <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> of vessels. Consequently, the maritime business activity at the Malacca Strait may be significantly affected {{and there will be}} the reshaping of the economies because of the new accessible sea route. Therefore, the contributions of this research are: 1) identification of the possible changes in maritime business patterns in Malaysia, and 2) determining the positive and negative implications with the use of 7 elements in a PESTLES analysis. These seven factors are aggregated to propose a future maritime business strategy in Malaysia that can generate revenue that would boost the maritime economy, for instance: 1) diversification by maritime businesses who could invest in regionally strategic areas, 2) development of the Tok Bali area as a bunker port to offer bunkering services, and 3) promotion of the Penang Port as the hub port of Malaysia. These strategies can reshape the Malaysian economy.|$|E
40|$|Rail is a {{critical}} transport mode for travel in large cities, especially for journeys {{to and from the}} CBD. Analysis of travel surveys commonly report aggregate statistics such as mode shares by purpose. These aggregate statistics provide an overview of the level of rail usage, however much more detailed analysis is needed to answer questions such as: Do the access mode shares to rail vary by distance from the CBD? What proportion of the total <b>journey</b> <b>distance</b> is by rail? What proportion of people travel to their nearest station? How far are people travelling to access their rail station? What proportion of people who use rail for their outward journeys from home also use rail for their return journey? Do people use the same mode for access for their outward journey as their egress mode for the return journey? This paper analyses data from the Sydney Household Travel Survey to answer the above questions for rail users in Sydney. Rather than just looking at single estimates the analysis will look at distributions recognising that people have a variety of travel patterns. 1...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{state of}} charge {{management}} of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) differs from their nonplug-in counterparts through the utilization of a charge depleting (CD) mode of operation. Several {{studies have shown that}} a blended mode of CD holds fuel economy advantages over a CD and charge sustaining (CS) combination, however, these approaches assume knowledge of the total <b>journey</b> <b>distance.</b> Here, this assumption is relaxed and the {{state of charge}} trajectory was recalculated online using a weaker assumption that only a probability distribution accumulated over past trips is available. The importance of other contributing factors to the state of charge profile such as vehicle velocity and altitude is also assessed. Simulation results on a prototype plug-in hybrid are presented with an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) used by the powertrain management to track the proposed state of charge trajectory. The financial and environmental benefits of the proposed approach relative to other state of charge management strategies are then calculated over a number of different cycles and conditions.

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of the built environment on human movement requires quantifying spatial structure in a general sense. Because of the difficulty of this task, studies of movement dynamics often ignore spatial heterogeneity and treat movement through <b>journey</b> lengths or <b>distances</b> alone. This study analyses public bicycle data from central London to reveal that, although <b>journey</b> <b>distances,</b> directions, and frequencies of occurrence are spatially variable, their relative spatial patterns remain largely constant, suggesting {{the influence}} of a fixed spatial template. A method is presented to describe this underlying space in terms of the relative orientation of movements toward, away from, and around locations of geographical or cultural significance. This produces two fields: one of convergence and one of divergence, which are able to accurately reconstruct the observed spatial variations in movement. These two fields also reveal categorical distinctions between shorter journeys merely serving diffusion away from significant locations, and longer journeys intentionally serving transport between spatially distinct centres of collective importance. Collective patterns of human movement are thus revealed to arise from a combination of both diffusive and directed movement, with aggregate statistics such as mean travel distances primarily determined by relative numbers of these two kinds of journeys...|$|R
