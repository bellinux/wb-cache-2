5|$|He 111 H-3: Similar to H-2, {{but with}} Jumo 211A-3 engines. Like the H-2, five MG 15 machine guns were standard. One A Stand MG FF cannon could be {{installed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and an MG 15 could {{be installed in}} the tail unit.|$|E
5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would have {{required}} a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E

25|$|TGVs have semi-permanently coupled {{articulated}} un-powered coaches, with Jacobs bogies {{between the}} coaches supporting both of them. Power cars {{at each end}} of the trains have their own bogies. Trains can be lengthened by coupling two TGVs, using couplers hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> of <b>the</b> power cars.|$|R
40|$|Infamous {{bacteria}} such as MRSA {{are considered}} “superbugs” {{because not only}} can they kill us using {{a wide range of}} virulence mechanisms, but they can also resist the effects of antibiotics. However, some superbugs reside on <b>the</b> skin and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> of a huge proportion of the human population causing only negligible problems for the majority...|$|R
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Nose</b> (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> wheel doors preventing them from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E

5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast to be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin and}} oral cavity telangiectasias are {{visually}} identifiable on physical examination, and similarly the lesions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{may be seen}} on endoscopy of the nasopharynx or on laryngoscopy. The severity of nosebleeds may be quantified objectively using a grid-like questionnaire in which the number of nosebleed episodes and their duration is recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} of the aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine guns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane still exist, including the two engines {{and a piece of}} the fuselage.|$|E

5000|$|The 750 Nardi-Danese (or 750ND) {{was a tiny}} machine, {{assembled}} on a Fiat 500 chassis, {{powered by}} a [...] 746 cc BMW flat twin motorcycle engine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme <b>nose</b> with its cylinder heads (sometimes) exposed and a single headlight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme <b>nose.</b> Despite <b>the</b> engine mounting, view over <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> was adequate, and unlike the Chicibio, the rear wheels were driven. It used a multi-tube chassis and was available as a monoposto (one-seater, or GP type) or due posti (two-seater, sports racer, when fitted with cycle fenders).|$|R

5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{help them to}} detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E

5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her.

When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> certain {{that he was trying to}} grab her.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{was used to}} illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E

5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were {{developed}} in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about 746kW (1,000hp). Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> The first prototype of the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E
5|$|The F-20 {{would have}} been able to use most of the common weapons in U.S.'s inventory, {{including}} the entire range of Mark 80 series bombs, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles. Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2.|$|E
