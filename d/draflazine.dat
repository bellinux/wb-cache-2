40|$|In 12 healthy male volunteers (27 - 53 yr), a {{placebo-controlled}} randomized {{double blind}} cross-over trial {{was performed to}} study {{the effect of the}} intravenous injection of 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg <b>draflazine</b> (a selective nucleoside transport inhibitor) on hemodynamic and neurohumoral parameters and ex vivo nucleoside transport inhibition. We hypothesized that an intravenous <b>draflazine</b> dosage without effect on hemodynamic and neurohumoral parameters would still be able to augment the forearm vasodilator response to intraarterially infused adenosine. Heart rate (electrocardiography), systolic blood pressure (Dinamap 1846 SX; Critikon, Portanje Electronica BV, Utrecht, The Netherlands) plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine increased dose-dependently and could almost totally be abolished by caffeine pretreatment indicating the involvement of adenosine receptors. <b>Draflazine</b> did not affect forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography). Intravenous injection of 0. 5 mg <b>draflazine</b> did not affect any of the measured hemodynamic parameters but still induced a significant ex vivo nucleoside-transport inhibition of 31. 5 +/- 4. 1 % (P < 0. 05 vs placebo). In a subgroup of 10 subjects the brachial artery was cannulated to infuse adenosine (0. 15, 0. 5, 1. 5, 5, 15, and 50 micrograms/ 100 ml forearm per min) before and after intravenous injection of 0. 5 mg <b>draflazine.</b> Forearm blood flow amounted 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 ml/ 100 ml forearm per min for placebo and 1. 8 +/- 0. 2, 2. 0 +/- 0. 3, 3. 8 +/- 0. 9, 6. 3 +/- 1. 2, 11. 3 +/- 2. 2, and 19. 3 +/- 3. 9 ml/ 100 ml forearm per min for the six incremental adenosine dosages, respectively. After the intravenous <b>draflazine</b> infusion, these values were 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 ml/ 100 ml forearm per min for placebo and 2. 1 +/- 0. 3, 3. 3 +/- 0. 6, 5. 8 +/- 1. 1, 6. 9 +/- 1. 4, 14. 4 +/- 2. 9, and 23. 5 +/- 4. 0 ml/ 100 ml forearm per min, respectively (Friedman ANOVA: P < 0. 05 before vs after <b>draflazine</b> infusion). In conclusion, a 30 - 50 % inhibition of adenosine transport significantly augments the forearm vasodilator response to adenosine without significant systemic effects.

40|$|Sabine S Maes, 1, 2 Stefan Pype, 1 Vincent LH Hoffmann, 3 Maria Biermans, 1 Theo F Meert 11 CNS Discovery Research, Pain and Neurology, Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, a Division of Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium; 2 Department of Anaesthesiology, University Hospital Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium; 3 Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care and Pain Treatment Center, Amphia Hospital, Breda, The NetherlandsBackground and methods: The {{role of the}} {{endogenous}} purine nucleoside, adenosine, in nociception is well established. Inhibition of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT 1) prevents adenosine uptake into cells, {{and could}} therefore enhance the antinociceptive properties of adenosine. The effects of ENT 1 inhibition were studied in two animal models of inflammatory pain. Analgesic activity was assessed in a complete Freund&# 39;s adjuvant (CFA) -induced and carrageenan-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia model in the guinea pig. Results: <b>Draflazine,</b> dipyridamole, dilazep, lidoflazine, soluflazine, and KF 24345 showed efficacy in the CFA thermal hyperalgesia model. <b>Draflazine,</b> the most potent compound in this test, was further characterized in the CFA model of mechanical hyperalgesia and the carrageenan inflammation model of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, where it completely reversed the hypersensitivity. The antihyperalgesic effects of <b>draflazine</b> (10 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously) were attenuated by the A 1 receptor antagonist, cyclopentyltheophylline (5 &ndash; 40 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), by the nonselective adenosine antagonist, caffeine (10 &ndash; 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and by the A 2 antagonist, DMPX (10 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally). Conclusion: ENT 1 inhibition is an effective way of reversing mechanical and thermal inflammatory hyperalgesia in the guinea pig, and these effects are mediated by enhancement of endogenous adenosine levels. Both A 1 and A 2 adenosine receptor subtypes {{are likely to be}} involved. Keywords: adenosine, nucleoside transport inhibition, nociception, inflammation, hyperalgesi...|$|E
40|$|NoThe genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes {{multiple}} homologues of the {{two major}} families of mammalian equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters. As part of a programme aimed at understanding the biological rationale underlying the multiplicity of eukaryote nucleoside transporters, we have now demonstrated that the nematode genes ZK 809. 4 (ent- 1) and K 09 A 9. 3 (ent- 2) encode equilibrative transporters, which we designate CeENT 1 and CeENT 2 respectively. These transporters resemble their human counterparts hENT 1 and hENT 2 in exhibiting similar broad permeant specificities for nucleosides, while differing in their permeant selectivities for nucleobases. They are insensitive to the classic inhibitors of mammalian nucleoside transport, nitrobenzylthioinosine, dilazep and <b>draflazine,</b> but are inhibited by the vasoactive drug dipyridamole. Use of green fluorescent protein reporter constructs indicated that the transporters are present in a limited number of locations in the adult, including intestine and pharynx. Their potential roles in these tissues were explored by using RNA interference to disrupt gene expression. Although disruption of ent- 1 or ent- 2 expression alone had no effect, simultaneous disruption of both genes yielded pronounced developmental defects involving the intestine and vulva...|$|E
40|$|Plasmodium, the {{aetiologic}} {{agent of}} malaria, cannot synthesize purines de novo, and hence depends upon salvage from the host. Here {{we describe the}} molecular cloning and functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of the first purine transporter to be identified in this parasite. This 422 -residue protein, which we designate PfENT 1, is predicted to contain 11 membrane-spanning segments and is a distantly related member of the widely distributed eukaryotic protein family the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). However, it differs profoundly at the sequence and functional levels from its homologous counterparts in the human host. The parasite protein exhibits a broad substrate specificity for natural nucleosides, but transports the purine nucleoside adenosine with a considerably higher apparent affinity (K(m) 0. 32 +/- 0. 05 mM) than the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (K(m) 3. 5 +/- 1. 1 mM). It also efficiently transports nucleobases such as adenine (K(m) 0. 32 +/- 0. 10 mM) and hypoxanthine (K(m) 0. 41 +/- 0. 1 mM), and anti-viral 3 '-deoxynucleoside analogues. Moreover, it is not sensitive to classical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, including NBMPR [6 -[(4 -nitrobenzyl) thio]- 9 -beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, or nitrobenzylthioinosine] and the coronary vasoactive drugs, dipyridamole, dilazep and <b>draflazine.</b> These unique properties suggest that PfENT 1 might be a viable target {{for the development of}} novel anti-malarial drugs...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian equilibrative {{nucleoside}} transporters {{are typically}} {{divided into two}} classes, es and ei, based on their sensitivity or resistance respectively to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). Previously, we have reported the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a prototypic es-type transporter, hENT 1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1), from human placenta. We now report the molecular cloning and functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of a cDNA from the same tissue encoding a homologous ei-type transporter, which we designate hENT 2. This 456 -residue protein is 46 % identical in amino acid sequence with hENT 1 and corresponds to a full-length form of the delayed-early proliferative response gene product HNP 36, a protein of unknown function previously cloned in a form bearing a sequence deletion. In addition to placenta, hENT 2 is found in brain, heart and ovarian tissue. Like hENT 1, hENT 2 mediates saturable transport of the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (Km 0. 2 +/- 0. 03 mM) and also transports the purine nucleoside adenosine. However, in contrast with hENT 1, which is potently inhibited by NBMPR (Ki 2 nM), hENT 2 is NBMPR-insensitive (IC 50 < 1 microM). It is also much less sensitive to inhibition by the coronary vasoactive drugs dipyridamole and dilazep and to the lidoflazine analogue <b>draflazine,</b> properties that closely resemble those reported for classical ei-type transport in studies with intact cells...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian cells express {{at least}} two subtypes of equilibrative {{nucleoside}} transporters, i. e. ENT 1 and ENT 2, which can be distinguished functionally by their sensitivity and resistance respectively to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine. The ENT 1 transporters exhibit distinctive species differences in their sensitivities to inhibition by dipyridamole, dilazep and <b>draflazine</b> (human>mouse>rat). A comparison of the ENT 1 structures in the three species would facilitate {{the identification of the}} regions involved in the actions of these cardioprotective agents. We now report the molecular cloning and functional expression of the murine (m) ENT 1 and mENT 2 transporters. mENT 1 and mENT 2 encode proteins containing 458 and 456 residues respectively, with a predicted 11 -transmembrane-domain topology. mENT 1 has 88 % and 78 % amino acid identity with rat ENT 1 and human ENT 1 respectively; mENT 2 is more highly conserved, with 94 % and 88 % identity with rat ENT 2 and human ENT 2 respectively. We have also isolated two additional distinct cDNAs that encode proteins similar to mENT 1; these probably represent distinct mENT 1 isoforms or alternative splicing products. One cDNA encodes a protein with two additional amino acids (designated mENT 1 b) that adds a potential protein kinase CK 2 phosphorylation site in the central intracellular loop of the transporter, and is similar, in this regard, to the human and rat ENT 1 orthologues. The other cDNA has a 5 '-untranslated region sequence that is distinct from that of full-length mENT 1. Microinjection of mENT 1, mENT 1 b or mENT 2 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in enhanced uptake of [(3) H]uridine by the oocytes relative to that seen in water-injected controls. mENT 1 -mediated, but not mENT 2 -mediated, [(3) H]uridine uptake was inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine and dilazep. Dipyridamole inhibited both mENT 1 and mENT 2, but was significantly more effective against mENT 1. Adenosine inhibited both systems with a similar potency, as did a range of other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. These results are compatible with the known characteristics of the native mENT 1 and mENT 2 transporters...|$|E
