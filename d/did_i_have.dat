500|$|The {{building}} {{opened and}} immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending {{a week of}} performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was [...] "a very mature building"; he smiled and replied: [...] "Ah, but <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to wait this long?" ...|$|E
500|$|Wilders stated about Israel: [...] "I {{have visited}} many {{interesting}} {{countries in the}} Middle East – from Syria to Egypt, from Tunisia to Turkey, from Cyprus to Iran – but nowhere <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the special feeling of solidarity that I always get when I land at Ben Gurion International Airport." [...] Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2's daily news programme Netwerk reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism. Wilders told an audience during the report that [...] "We [...] are all Israel". He has also said [...] "Israel is the West's first line of defence" [...] against what he perceives {{to be a threat}} posed by Islam.|$|E

500|$|When Oppenheimer {{appointed}} Hans Bethe as {{the head}} of the laboratory's prestigious Theoretical (T) Division, he offended Edward Teller, who was given his own group, tasked with investigating Teller's [...] "Super" [...] bomb, and eventually assigned to Enrico Fermi's F Division. Oppenheimer then wrote to Groves requesting that Peierls be sent to take Teller's place in T Division. Peierls arrived from New York on 8 February 1944, and subsequently succeeded Chadwick as head of the British Mission at Los Alamos. Egon Bretscher worked in Teller's Super group, as did Anthony French, who later recalled that [...] "never at any time <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> anything to do with the fission bomb once I went to Los Alamos." [...] Four members of the British Mission became group leaders: Bretscher (Super Experimentation), Frisch (Critical Assemblies and Nuclear Specifications), Peierls (Implosion Hydrodynamics) and George Placzek (Composite Weapon).|$|E
500|$|Later that day, Solanas turned herself in, {{gave up her}} gun, and {{confessed to}} the shooting, telling a police officer that Warhol [...] "had too much control in my life." [...] She was {{fingerprinted}} and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating: [...] "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." [...] Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement {{that she was an}} actress. The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating [...] "I'm a writer, not an actress." [...] At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said [...] "it was for the opposite reason", that [...] "he has a legal claim on my works." [...] Solanas told the judge that [...] "it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me." [...] She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she [...] "was right in what I <b>did!</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nothing to regret!" [...] "The judge struck her comments from the court record" [...] and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, [...] "it was like {{falling in love with}} a woman.... not until I acted the part of Hamlet <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a moment when I knew I was in love with acting."
