40|$|Transaction costs {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} ways of aligning appropriate governance modes with the attributes of economic transactions. Nowadays transaction costs are universally accepted, despite the difficulty in measuring and quantifying them. Starting from the customary definition of transaction costs, this paper proposes {{a model for the}} buyer/seller relationship, focusing on the uncertainty characterizing the exchange and the connected costs. In particular, according to a well-known classification, the transaction costs connected to the purchasing phase are divided into ex ante (drafting and negotiating agreements) and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> (<b>monitoring</b> and enforcing agreements) costs. More precisely, we propose to employ appropriate deterministic models for evaluating ex ante costs and suitable statistical distributions for ex post costs. Obviously, both such costs categories require the quantification of several parameters related to the buyer operating the transaction and to the uncertainty characterizing the buyer/seller relationship. Hence, in order t...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of two empirical studies on the value-added of venture capital with special attention on promoting internationalisation of start-up firms. The first study {{is based on a}} survey of Finnish (and a few cross-border) venture capital organisations on the value-adding mechanisms they use with regard to their portfolio firms. The second study is based on interviews with Finnish biotechnology start-ups. Attention is paid specifically to the strategies of three different types of investors in early-stage high growth companies : 1) business angels, which can be regarded as informal venture capitalists, 2) private-sector venture capital firms and 3) public-sector venture capital organisations. Control of agency costs and risks provides a conceptual framework for analysing the strategies of the different investor types. The findings partially corroborate and partially refute the hypotheses {{made on the basis of}} theory and the two studies provide somewhat conflicting findings on the role and strategies of the different investor types.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} optimal government bailout policy {{where the}} costs of systemic failures and moral hazard problems are considered. We find that a three-tiered bailout policy that includes an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>monitoring</b> and bailout scheme for financial institutions with large systemic impacts (2 ̆ 7 {{too big to fail}} 2 ̆ 7) is optimal. The optimal policy also requires a randomized bailout for medium-impact institutions (2 ̆ 7 Constructive Ambiguity 2 ̆ 7), and no bailout for institutions that have only minimal systemic consequences (2 ̆ 7 too small to save 2 ̆ 7). However, in a volatile, innovative market environment where individual institutions may know more than the government regulator, monitoring error could contribute to risk taking, leaving the government regulator to always play a 2 ̆ 7 catch-up 2 ̆ 7 role in revising policy. Moreover, the optimal bailout policy may not be time-consistent: institutions not deemed 2 ̆ 7 too big to fail 2 ̆ 7 may still have an incentive to take excessive risks and expect to be bailed out in case of insolvency, primarily due to the short-term orientation of the government.

40|$|My {{research}} identifies {{conditions for}} legislators in emerging presidential democracies to achieve bureaucratic accountability, {{one of the}} least studies aspects of legislative politics. To better explain legislators' ability to hold the bureaucracy accountable, I develop a theoretical model of oversight in which resource constraints (i. e., capabilities) and electoral motivations and policy preferences (i. e., incentives) explain legislators' behavior. The model shows that legislators' oversight of bureaucratic behavior is always selective. Legislators' strategy responds to the relevance of every policy area and to legislators' resources for monitoring bureaucratic agencies. Given limited resources, legislative oversight is necessarily discriminatory. An important corollary is that bureaucratic accountability is never complete : There will always be policy areas that are systematically neglected on the oversight agenda. This situation worsens in the absence of alternative mechanisms to keep bureaucratic behavior under control (such as effective legislation to access public information). The model also shows that bureaucratic agencies respond strategically to legislators' actions depending on the probability of being sanctioned. To evaluate my theory, I analyze local legislatures in Mexico (1995 - 2005). The qualitative analysis shows that Mexican legislators have strong constitutional resources to control and oversee their functioning. However, feeble resources prevent them for making use of the most important strategic device of bureaucratic control (setting the margin of discretion for bureaucratic agencies) and force local legislatures to make use of an active and direct strategy of legislative <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>monitoring</b> : the annual review of public accounts (fiscalización de cuentas públicas) which is usually done by an auxiliary legislative institution, commonly known as supreme auditing institution (SAIs) (chapter three). I also present the analysis of the legislation that regulates SAIs in four Mexican states and show that electoral uncertainty usually works as an incentive to strengthen the legal powers of SAIs; however, it also has an opposite effect if it increases the fragmentation of power within the legislature (chapter four). In sum, the analysis of how local legislators aim to control the bureaucracy shows that bureaucratic accountability needs resources (e. g., constitutional powers, professional legislators or professional staff) and incentives that help to break the endogenous character of the proble...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of genetically-modified (GM) crops is {{often accompanied by}} other changes in cultural practices. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate these changes with the simulation model FLORSYS which quantifies the effects of cropping systems and pedoclimate on weed dynamics as well as indicators of weed-related biodiversity (species richness and equitability, trophic resources for birds, insects and pollinators) and crop production loss (yield loss, harvest contamination, harvesting problems, field infestation). The study focused on two GM maize variety types, i. e. expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins against insects (Bt) and tolerating the non-selective herbicide glyphosate (HT). Two contrasting maize-growing sites were studied: Aquitaine, a region in South-Western France, and Catalonia in North-Eastern Spain. Typical regional cropping systems containing maize were identified for each site from expert knowledge and the Biovigilance database recording French agricultural practices. GM scenarios were based on expert knowledge, literature and current Spanish practices. A total of 11 most probable scenarios (1 conventional, 3 Bt and 8 HT) were simulated over 28 years for each region, and repeated with 10 different regional random weather series. An additional series of 5 - 7 scenarios per region was run to decorrelate factors, and make it easier to identify the cultural practices responsible for changes in weed flora, biodiversity and production. The simulations showed that the changes accompanying the {{introduction of}} GM maize varieties affected weed flora as well as weed-related biodiversity and crop production loss, but that the consequences depended on local conditions. Most of these consequences were caused by simplifications in the cropping systems made possible by the GM varieties, rather than by the glyphosate associated to GM varieties. Simplified tillage or no-till increased weed harmfulness, particularly in Aquitaine where the weed flora was poorer and dominated by larger and more persistent species. Conversely, no-till cancelled part or all of the nefarious effects on biodiversity of simplified rotations (maize/wheat and maize monoculture), particularly by improving trophic resources offered by weeds to birds, insects and pollinators. Overall, biodiversity was less affected by simplified rotations in Catalonia where the initial weed flora was richer and more equitable. Delayed maize sowing reduced weed harmfulness and biodiversity, except food offer for insects and pollinators whose pertinent feeding period covered spring and summer (vs. winter for birds). Based on the two most affected weed-based biodiversity indicators, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>monitoring</b> after GM introduction should focus on birds in Aquitaine and on pollinators in Catalonia.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} five chapters {{and a short}} introduction. Chapter 1 reexamines the "stylised facts" about {{cyclical fluctuations}} in external balances proposed by real business cycle economists and investigates whether technology shocks are {{the main source of}} fluctuations in external balances. It is found that real business cycle evidence is not invariant to the method of detrending and a substantial proportion of movement of current accounts is due to demand shocks. Furthermore, it is found that the single commodity real business cycle model cannot explain countercyclical movement of current accounts. Chapter 2 studies the effect of anticipated inflation on economic growth in an endogenous growth model. Money is introduced into an endogenous growth model which exchange requires cash-in-advance. It is shown that the decentralized competitive outcome is an inefficient balanced growth equilibrium. It is also shown that efficiency is restorable by means of a well-known optimum money supply rule. Chapter 3 extends the basic product variety endogenous growth model by introducing a fixed cost in research and development. It is shown that the fixed cost determines the rate of growth. By integrating with the human capital accumulation, it is shown that the It is growth rate of output is twice the rate of human capital accumulation without any increasing returns to scale or externality assumptions. In addition, this chapter also studies the effects of trade liberalization of physical goods on economic growth and further discuss the effect of economic integration on economic growth. Chapter 4 addresses the question of whether environmental conservation adversely affects growth. It is shown that environmental control is not necessarily a depressant on growth from a laissez-faire economy. Even if the economy starts off pursuing optimal growth without considering environmental damage, the growth rate of output may be increased if the environment is a factor of production. Chapter 5 deals with financial development in an endogenous growth model. The model integrates theories of growth and financial intermediation. Problems of moral hazard dictate that an optimal loan contract must involve either ex ante or <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>monitoring</b> which is costly. However, lenders can delegate the monitoring to a financial intermediary. It is found that there is a positive, two-way causal relationship between growth and financial development. Different economies may evolve towards different financial systems depending on cross-country differences in the relative costs of these systems. In addition, it is also shown that the market may choose a financial system which does not generate the fastest possible economic growth...|$|E

Instead of the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> incentives, or <b>monitoring</b> of teachers, it focuses on the job preferences and skills of teachers in order to draw inferences about the initial selection of teachers. We rely on a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to measure the preferences of teachers at a training stage. This is a stated preference methodology that has been popular {{in the area of}} health and environmental economics for measuring preferences over various products or services. Its application to labour market questions is recent, and it has so far been used to study the job preferences of health workers (see e.g. Chomitz et al. 1998; Penn-Kekana et al. 2005; Hanson and Jack 2010; Mangham and Hanson 2008 and Kolstad 2011). As far as the authors are aware, ours is the first study that measures the job preferences of teachers in developing countries using such an experimental approach. In the context of developed countries, there is a literature analysing the preferences of teachers from observed data on actual postings and transfers (see e.g. Hanushek et al. 2004; Boyd et al. 2010 and Boyd et al. 2011).|$|R
