[...] Speaking of signing professional forms Johnson said [...] "It's fantastic to turn professional under Frank Warren who is the man to guide me to achieve my dream, to become world champion." [...] The decision to join Warren's stable of boxers meant that Johnson joined the likes of other former Commonwealth Games gold medalists to have turned pro with Warren including Scotsman Alex Arthur who won gold in 1998 and Stephen Smith, Jamie Cox and Don Broadhurst all of whom won gold in 2006. [...] Speaking of his decision to go into boxing management Naseem Hamed claimed that boxing had become [...] "downtrodden" [...] Johnson would add a bit of [...] "sparkle" [...] to the sport saying [...] "Callum Johnson {{is going to be the}} guy to put that in. He is going to be the best breath of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>boxing</b> can have." [...] He added [...] "I think his first ten fights will be ten knockouts and he'll be world champion within three years." [...] On 4 December 2010 Johnson made his professional debut at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow boxing on the undercard of Ricky Burns world title defence against Andreas Evenson. The fight against Phillip Townley was stopped in the second round, handing Townley his first stoppage defeat and a first win for Johnson. [...] Speaking of the nature of the victory, Naseem Hamed said [...] "This guy's got dynamite in his hands...I just feel that he is so explosive, so chilling. He throws his punches so correctly. That is one of the reasons I got involved with Callum Johnson."His second fight took place on 14 March 2011, in which he faced Jody Meikle. The fight went on to the final stage and was won by points (40-35 to Callum). This marked his second victory in 2 professional fights, keeping his record as a 100% win.|$|R

50|$|At low speeds (subsonic speeds) {{increases}} in static pressure are however {{limited to a}} few percent. Given that the air velocity is reduced to zero without losses the pressure increase can be calculated accordingly. The lack of losses also means without heating the air. Thus a ram-air intake also is a cold air intake. In some cars the intake is placed behind the radiator, where not only the air is hot, but the pressure is below ambient pressure. The ram-air intake effect may be small, but so are other mild tuning techniques to increase cylinder filling like using larger, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> filters, high flow mass flow sensors, velocity stacks, tuned <b>air</b> <b>box</b> and large tubes from the filter to the engine.|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{volume is}} always restricted to save energy, which sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) to some extent. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Therefore, IAQ can be improved by increasing the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduced into an air-conditioning system. In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests. In addition, the proposed system and a conventional system are compared. In the proposed system, {{with the increase in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the heating load for solution regeneration rises, the dehumidification efficiency increases and the regeneration efficiency drops. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %. The results also show that the proposed system can save power notably. The maximum power saving ratio is 58. 9 % when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio is 20 %; however, the ratio drops when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio increases. These findings will be beneficial in the selection of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilation strategies for liquid desiccant based air-conditioning systems.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{office building}} design, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements are estimated for full occupancy in the building. Typically, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements range from 5 to 15 {{cubic feet per}} minute per person expected to occupy the building. While the design total amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> used is satisfactory for full occupancy of the building, there are many instances less than the design occupancy. Thus, there may be many instances in a commercial building where more <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> is used than is actually required because the occupancy is below the design occupancy. In hot and humid climates, such as the Gulf Southwest, a considerable portion of the cooling energy in a commercial building is expended cooling and dehumidifying the air needed to maintain <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements. If {{the total amount of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> could be reduced to just match that needed by the number of occupants in a building, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the energy use for cooling.
