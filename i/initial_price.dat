Across the northern Arabian Sea, the passage of Gonu produced stronger winds and significant upwelling– an oceanographic phenomenon that involves {{the replacement of the}} nutrient-depleted surface water with deeper nutrient-rich water; the passage caused a significant increase in phytoplankton. Additionally, the cyclone delayed the arrival of the Indian Ocean south-west monsoon in the Western Ghats in India.|$|E

Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price.

5|$|The first F-111C {{was officially}} {{delivered}} in 1968, finally giving Australia an aircraft that could fly to Jakarta, drop bombs, and return without refueling. (The RAAF only acquired air-to-air refueling for the F/A-18, possibly to avoid causing difficulties with other Asian countries {{by increasing the}} F-111C's already great range.) Training began in 1967, with RAAF personnel seeing terrain-following radar and other sophisticated equipment for the first time. However, development delays and structural problems delayed acceptance of aircraft by the RAAF until 1973. These issues were mainly {{to do with the}} wing attach points, and the redesign of the F-111 engine intakes. Completion of contractual requirements to the satisfaction of Australia also took time, damaging the morale of the hundreds of trained RAAF personnel who had little to do. The program costs, during 1963–1967, grew at an alarming rate; estimates by the USAF {{at the start of the}} program was placed at US$124.5 million, but by April 1967 had risen to $237.75 million. While the <b>initial</b> <b>price</b> of US$5.21 million per aircraft was capped at US$5.95 million, R, labor, and other costs were not. The rising price, three unexplained losses of USAF F-111As in Vietnam during their first month of deployment, and the British and U.S. Navy's orders' cancellations caused further controversy in Australia during 1968. By 1973, however, when the F-111A had accumulated 250,000 flight hours, it had the best safety record among contemporary aircraft, which presaged the F-111C's own excellent record.|$|E

Detailed information on 66 farm-gate tomato transactions and daily tomato wholesale price data from the central vegetable market in Addis Ababa are used for the analysis. Estimation results show that farmers are less committed to their <b>initial</b> ask <b>price</b> when the buyer speaks out the transaction price first, when their quality perceptions of the tomatoes being transacted {{differ from those of}} the buyers, and when their tomato farm is at a large distance from the main road.

Demand for the traditional American continued to grow as sales increased to 120,603 units (of which 44,817 were two-door sedans, 46,973 four-door sedans, and 28,813 station wagons), thus helping AMC reach 7.5 percent of the U.S. market with a total Rambler sales of 485,745 automobiles and third place among domestic brands.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{business model}} for video rental stores had traditionally been {{to pay a}} large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower <b>initial</b> <b>price,</b> Blockbuster also capitalized {{on the fact that}} movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods.

The value of the new product is initially uncertain and new information is generated through purchases in the market. We derive the (unique) Markov perfect equilibrium of the infinite horizon game under the strong long run average payoff criterion. The qualitative features of the optimal entry strategy are shown to depend exclusively on the relative ranking of established and new products based on current beliefs. Superior products are launched relatively slowly and at high <b>initial</b> <b>prices</b> whereas substitutes for existing products are launched aggressively at low <b>initial</b> <b>prices.</b> The robustness of these results with respect to different model specifications is discussed.
