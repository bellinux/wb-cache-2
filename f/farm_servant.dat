60|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{a year after}} this {{marriage}} that Will was awakened late one night {{by the sound of}} a horse galloping on the road, followed by precipitate knocking at the inn-door. He opened his window and saw a <b>farm</b> <b>servant,</b> mounted and holding a led horse by the bridle, who told him to make what haste he could and go along with him; for Marjory was dying, and had sent urgently to fetch him to her bedside. Will was no horseman, and made so little speed upon the way that the poor young wife was very near her end before he arrived. But they had some minutes' talk in private, and he was present and wept very bitterly while she breathed her last.|$|E

But a shadow hung over him which really {{poisoned}} most of his pleasure, and that was the thought of the poor innocent girl who had suffered in his stead, for his foster father had told him in secret, that he was the king's son. And the prince determined that when he grew old enough he would travel all over the world, and never rest till he had set her free. To become king at the cost of a maiden's life was too heavy a price to pay. So one day he put on the dress of a <b>farm</b> <b>servant,</b> threw a sack of peas on his back, and marched straight into the forest where eighteen years before his father had lost himself. After he had walked some way he began to cry loudly: 'Oh, how unlucky I am! Where can I be? Is there no one to show me {{the way out of the}} wood?' ...|$|E

40|$|Life-cycle {{service was}} one of the {{characteristic}} aspects of the European Marriage Pattern. The majority of the children of labourers and peasants left the household of their parents during adolescence to acquire material resources and skills in preparation of marriage. Whilst in service, adolescents could save part of their wages. As most of them worked in close geographical proximity to their family, children in service were also a potential source of income for their parents. This paper studies the nature, frequency and value of remittances from <b>farm</b> <b>servants</b> to their parents in three countries during the eighteenth century. Important differences emerge from this comparative study. <b>Farm</b> <b>servants</b> in Belgium and France frequently supported their parents financially with their earnings. In England parents could in most cases not rely on structural assistance from their unmarried adolescent children. I argue that property rights explain these differences. The absence of land that could be passed on through inheritance operated as a check to intergenerational solidarity. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} decades of the nineteenth century, the {{lifecycle}} service system was still intact in rural Groningen. Not only children from labouring families, but also of quite a few other families, were working as live-in <b>farm</b> <b>servants</b> between their early teens and marriage. However, over the course of the nineteenth century fewer children of farmers and non-agricultural households became live-in <b>farm</b> <b>servants.</b> In the same period, more slightly older children stepped out of the lifecycle servant system well before marriage. Consequently, the share of young teenagers among the live-in workforce was increasing, and their average age was falling. Many older unmarried children of labourers started to work as non-resident labourers, and increasing numbers never even entered service. Servanthood was suddenly no longer an ordinary stage in the lifecycle of nearly all children of labouring and other lower class rural families. The system deteriorated because increasingly these relatively poor families were no longer inclined to send all their adolescent children to other’s houses for work from 1860 onward. As a reaction to this fall in supply of servants, servants’ wages at first rose, as farmers still wanted their labour. Presumably, this costly labour strategy of rejecting service – made possible by rising real wages – was motivated by a rising preference for family life and for more freedom for the children. However, it was not without costs as it resulted in a less secure livelihood and a worse income than live-in service. In the long run, however, children who remained at home had better chances than those who entered service, and in this way stepping out of the lifecycle servant system can be seen as an investment in human capital. The high wages of the live-in servants at first stimulated smaller farmers to stop hiring live-in personnel, and by 1910 almost only large farmers employed live-in personnel. However, around World War One they too dismissed their male <b>farm</b> <b>servants</b> and most of their female servants. This was presumably connected to a greater desire for privacy by the large farmers. So the first and heaviest blow to the system was given by the labouring families, however, the system was nearly completely swept away a few decades later by decisions of the farming families. After World War One live-in <b>farm</b> <b>servants</b> became rare in the Groningen agriculture, while the few female servants still living on farms were mainly occupied with domestic work and far less involved in agricultur...|$|R
