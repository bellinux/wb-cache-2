40|$|Abstract Background Global carbon {{stocks in}} forest biomass are {{decreasing}} by 1. 1 Gt of carbon annually, owing to continued deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation emissions are partly offset by forest expansion {{and increases in}} growing stock primarily in the extra-tropical north. Innovative financial mechanisms {{would be required to}} help reducing deforestation. Using a spatially explicit integrated biophysical and socio-economic land use model we estimated the impact of carbon price incentive schemes and <b>payment</b> <b>modalities</b> on deforestation. One <b>payment</b> <b>modality</b> is adding costs for carbon emission, the other is to pay incentives for keeping the forest carbon stock intact. Results Baseline scenario calculations show that close to 200 mil ha or around 5 % of todays forest area will be lost between 2006 and 2025, resulting in a release of additional 17. 5 GtC. Today's forest cover will shrink by around 500 million hectares, which is 1 / 8 of the current forest cover, within the next 100 years. The accumulated carbon release during the next 100 years amounts to 45 GtC, which is 15 % of the total carbon stored in forests today. Incentives of 6 US$/tC for vulnerable standing biomass payed every 5 year will bring deforestation down by 50 %. This will cause costs of 34 billion US$/year. On the other hand a carbon tax of 12 $/tC harvested forest biomass will also cut deforestation by half. The tax income will, if enforced, decrease from 6 billion US$ in 2005 to 4. 3 billion US$ in 2025 and 0. 7 billion US$ in 2100 due to decreasing deforestation speed. Conclusion Avoiding deforestation requires financial mechanisms that make retention of forests economically competitive with the currently often preferred option to seek profits from other land uses. Incentive payments need to be at a very high level to be effective against deforestation. Taxes on the other hand will extract budgetary revenues from the regions which are already poor. A combination of incentives and taxes {{could turn out to be}} a viable solution for this problem. Increasing the value of forest land and thereby make it less easily prone to deforestation would act as a strong incentive to increase productivity of agricultural and fuelwood production, which could be supported by revenues generated by the deforestation tax. </p...|$|R

40|$|Market {{gardening}} {{has been}} increasing fast in Senegal. But farmers face high marketing risks: daily price fluctuations exceed an average 20 % for some products, seasonality is strong, anticipation based on prices leads to cyclic movements. Farmers and market operators have found various forms of coordination to manage uncertainty. “Coxers” are specifically dedicated to information gathering, either in rural or wholesale urban markets or to transport negotiation. Paid per unit handled, they limit their own risk, whereas they reduce uncertainty for their partners. In other cases, interlinked transactions permit to provide inputs to producers despite the deficient credit market; meanwhile, it secures merchants access to product. As {{it is the case}} in many other countries, information provided by MIS is of little help to Senegalese market gardeners. The updated and more targeted access to information through MANOBI services allows producers to improve their negotiation capacity.

40|$|Hawala networks, or Informal Funds Transfer Systems (IFTS), are age-old {{means of}} {{conducting}} cross-border financial transactions. They thrive in regions {{where there is}} inadequate or nonexistent financial infrastructure due to poverty, daunting geography, or endemic conflict. Such regions are home to poor and underserved communities hungry for and {{in desperate need of}} financial services. IFTS provide access to these relatively ignored markets through the use of specific transactional mechanisms, <b>payment</b> <b>modalities,</b> and clearing and settlement options. With these innovative and flexible techniques, IFTS have successfully tapped into the exponentially growing global remittance market. Hawala networks are also used by NGOs and humanitarian aid organizations operating in post-conflict regions, and by diaspora communities looking to provide vital services for family members in their country of origin. IFTS, however, can also be illegitimately used for smuggling, capital flight, or terrorist activities. Formal financial institutions can learn how to better access the remittance market and serve remote or poor communities by learning from the key operational characteristics that make IFTS so successful: speed and efficiency, accessibility and adaptability, affordability, anonymity, cultural sensitivity, and relational contracts. Understanding these operational characteristics can allow for innovative, Hawala-inspired inclusion techniques to be incorporated into the formal infrastructure. Mobile banking, adaptive financial procedures and services, broad integration, and a shift in the banking culture would not only allow for formal financial institutions {{to gain access to the}} lucrative remittance market, but would also improve access to financial services for the poor and underserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) {{is one of}} {{the health}} {{financing}} options adopted by Nigeria for improved healthcare access especially to the low income earners. One of the key operators of the scheme is the health care providers, thus their uptake of the scheme is fundamental to the survival of the scheme. The study reviewed the uptake of the NHIS by private health care providers in a Local Government Area in Lagos State. Objective: To assess the uptake of the NHIS by private healthcare practitioners. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study recruited 180 private healthcare providers selected by multistage sampling technique with a response rate of 88. 9 %. Result: Awareness, knowledge and uptake of NHIS were 156 (97. 5 %), 110 (66. 8 %) and 97 (60. 6 %), respectively. Half of the respondents 82 (51. 3 %) were dissatisfied with the operations of the scheme. Major reasons were failure of entitlement payment by Health Maintenance Organisations 13 (81. 3 %) and their incurring losses in participating in the scheme 8 (50 %). There was a significant association between awareness, level of education, knowledge of NHIS and registration into scheme by the respondents P-value < 0. 05. Conclusions: Awareness and knowledge of NHIS were commendable among the private health care providers.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results from a survey of landowner interest in a propositional <b>payment</b> <b>modality</b> for Costa Rica's Pagos por Servicios Ambientales (PSA) program {{that is based on}} a sliding-scale payment scheme. This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to lower payments per hectare per year for additional units of land invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to smaller-scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little sensitivity to payment size, and in general—with mode= 10 and median= 7 responses on a 10 point Likert-scale—indicated strong willingness to participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were introduced.

The need to fight inflation by reducing budget outlays and deficits remained a constant theme with the Commonwealth governments under Prime ministers Fraser, Hawke and Keating.
