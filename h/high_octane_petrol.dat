5000|$|The 1.8-liter {{iteration}} (...) has a 84.8 mm bore and a 79.5 mm stroke. It {{was first}} {{available in the}} facelifted Opel Manta B in May 1982, and quickly made its way {{into a number of}} other Opel and GM cars. It was originally available as the 18N and the 18S, for low and <b>high</b> <b>octane</b> <b>petrol</b> respectively. The C18NV was first installed in the Opel Rekord E2 from May 1985 {{and was one of the}} first catalysed mass market automobiles sold in Germany (and Europe). In 1983, the 1.8 L engine was added to certain North American market J-cars; the engines were imported from Brazil. The LA5 (RPO code) is a turbocharged version that was optional in the North American market from 1984.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1960 a de luxe {{version of}} the Arabella {{was added to the}} range. As far as the {{technical}} specifications were concerned, the Arabella de Luxe was differentiated from the standard model by its engine. It was still a 4-cylinder 897 cc unit, but maximum power was increased to 45 PS (33 kW) at 5,300 rpm. This was achieved by increasing the compression ration from 1:7½ on the standard model to 1:9. [...] That in turn meant that drivers had to pay a little more for their fuel, because the higher compression ration necessitated the use of the [...] "super" [...] grade (<b>high</b> <b>octane)</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) which was beginning to become available at West German service stations. The other important difference was the fitting of a larger Solex carburetor (34 PCI in place of the 28 mm carburetor used for the standard cars). [...] The result was a useful improvement in performance, with the top speed increased from 120 km/h to 133 km/h (from 75 mph to 83 mph), while the standing start time to 100 km/h was reduced from 28 to 23 seconds. [...] The Arabella de luxe was in these respects significantly brisker than more expensive (albeit larger and heavier) cars such as the Ford Taunus or, more importantly, the class-defining Volkswagen with its advertised top speed, in 1960, of only 112 km/h (70 mph) and leisurely standing start time to 100 km/h of 38 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The 1584 cc L {{version has}} a larger 85.0 mm bore {{and the same}} 69.8 mm stroke as most CIH fours. It was {{introduced}} in September 1970 with the all new Opel Manta A and then, seven weeks later, in the Opel Ascona A. The 16N uses lower octane fuel and has a lower compression ratio, while the more powerful 16S uses <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> <b>petrol.</b> Power outputs were [...] {{at the time of}} introduction; the outputs were lowered after the beginning of 1975 when desmogged engines were introduced. Output was now [...] respectively. From 1975 there was also a cleaner yet A16S version with 69 PS for some markets.|$|R
5000|$|With both air {{and fuel}} {{in a closed}} cylinder, {{compressing}} the mixture too much poses the danger of auto-ignition — or behaving like a diesel engine. Because {{of the difference in}} burn rates between the two different fuels, petrol engines are mechanically designed with different timing than diesels, so to auto-ignite a petrol engine causes the expansion of gas inside the cylinder to reach its greatest point before the cylinder has reached the [...] "top dead center" [...] (T.D.C) position. Spark plugs are typically set statically or at idle at a minimum of 10 degrees or so of crankshaft rotation before the piston reaches T.D.C, but at much higher values at higher engine speeds to allow time for the fuel-air charge to substantially complete combustion before too much expansion has occurred - gas expansion occurring with the piston moving down in the power stroke. <b>Higher</b> <b>octane</b> <b>petrol</b> burns slower, therefore it has a lower propensity to auto-ignite and its rate of expansion is lower. Thus, engines designed to run high-octane fuel exclusively can achieve higher compression ratios.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the potential {{problems in the}} exploitation of the older generation of spark-ignition engines with <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> number of <b>petrol</b> (unleaded petrol BMB 95) than required (leaded petrol MB 86). Within the experimental tests on two different engines (STEYR-PUCH model 712 and GAZ 41) by applying piezoelectric pressure sensors integrated with the engine spark plugs, acceleration sensors (accelerometers) and special electronic block connected with distributor, show that the cumulative first and second theoretical phase of combustion when <b>petrol</b> of <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> number (BMB 95) is used lasts slightly longer than when the low-octane petrol MB 86 is used. For new petrol (BMB 95) higher optimal angles of pre-ignition have been determined by which better performances of the engine are achieved without a danger of the combustion with detonation (also called knocking) ...|$|R
50|$|Biodiesel {{is similar}} to diesel, but has {{differences}} akin to those between petrol and ethanol. For instance, biodiesel has a higher cetane rating (45-60 compared to 45-50 for crude-oil-derived diesel) and it acts as a cleaning agent {{to get rid of}} dirt and deposits. It has been argued that it only becomes economically feasible above oil prices of $80 (£40 or €60 as of late February, 2007) per barrel. This does however depend on locality, economic situation, government stance on biodiesel {{and a host of other}} factors- and it has been proven to be viable at much lower costs in some countries. Also, it yields about 10% less energy than ordinary diesel. Analogous to the use of higher compression ratios used for engines burning <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> alcohols and <b>petrol</b> in spark-ignition engines, taking advantage of biodiesel's high cetane rating can potentially overcome the energy deficit compared to ordinary Number 2 diesel.|$|R

When run on ethanol, the power increases to [...] at 7000 rpm and [...] of torque at 5600 rpm. This {{is a direct result}} of the cooling properties of ethanol in the engine's combustion chambers along with the added boost, made possible by ethanol's <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> rating when compared to gasoline. Due to the lower specific energy content of ethanol, the CCXR burns slightly more fuel than the CCX with a combined fuel consumption of [...] under the EU cycle.|$|R

50|$|The {{filling process}} {{takes place at}} the {{overpressure}} phase, using a mechanical gas compressor and a throttle for the purpose of regulation.The load change is assisted by a four stroke piston, working as a dynamic boosting system and allowing the good scavenging of working space. There is a possibility of changing the relative piston positions during the engine work, that gives the possibility of changing the compression ratio depending on the temporary level of the load.
