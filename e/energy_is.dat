5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
