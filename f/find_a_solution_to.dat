25|$|Prior to {{building}} Sampo, Finland {{had only one}} state-owned icebreaker, Murtaja, which was built in 1890 {{and was one of}} the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. However, the 930-ton single-screw vessel was not powerful enough to keep even the southernmost port of Finland, Hanko, open during severe winters and the icebreaking characteristics of its spoon-shaped bow were not as good as was hoped for. A committee, appointed by the Senate of Finland in 1895 to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the problem, came to a conclusion that a second state-owned icebreaker would be needed.|$|E

The Home Office proposed to introduce measures that would raise the age limit for international marriage visas from 18 to 21, which would impact on the strictly orthodox community.

He then got in touch with a civil society consultant at the City of Copenhagen, Dorthe Pedersen, who was intrigued by the idea, and together they bought five cycle rickshaws and launched an organization called Cycling Without Age, which has now spread to all corners of Denmark, and since 2015 to another 28 countries around the world.|$|E

25|$|Self-reducibility {{describes}} the phenomenon that, {{if we can}} quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where s'i denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant i. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If {{one of these two}} tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived.|$|E

25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem per se is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes {{as it was a}} problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success. They could <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the problem of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.|$|E

The Sikh leaders asked for a Sikh state with Ambala, Jalandher, Lahore Divisions with some districts from the Multan Division, which, however, {{did not meet the}} Cabinet delegates' agreement. In discussions with Jinnah, the Cabinet Mission offered either a 'smaller Pakistan' with all the Muslim-majority districts except Gurdaspur or a 'larger Pakistan' under the sovereignty of the Indian Union. The Cabinet Mission came close to success with its proposal for an Indian Union under a federal scheme, but it fell apart in the end because of Nehru's opposition to a heavily decentralised India.|$|E
