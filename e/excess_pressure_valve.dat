50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a <b>pressure</b> regulator <b>valve</b> and a <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the <b>pressure</b> regulator <b>valve</b> fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the <b>pressure</b> regulator <b>valve</b> that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|R

50|$|The device {{consists}} of two independent check valves, plumbed in series, with a pressure monitored chamber between. The chamber is maintained at a pressure that {{is lower than the}} water supply pressure, but high enough to be useful downstream. The reduced pressure is guaranteed by a differential <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve,</b> which automatically relieves <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> in the chamber by discharging to a drain. Four test cocks are installed to allow an inspector to verify proper operation of the valve with a differential pressure meter. Two gate valves (one before and one after the RPZD) are provided to allow for testing and repair.|$|R

50|$|Once {{a coffee}} bean is roasted, {{it is either}} {{packaged}} immediately for sale, or ground and then packaged for sale. Packages used are typically either an airtight plastic container or vacuum-sealed wrapping, or a folded-over bag with a <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve.</b> Each type of package has its own advantages. The airtight containers allow maximum freshness of the bean and prolong its shelf life, whilst the valve allows excess carbon dioxide, and other gases to escape. The carbon dioxide, as much as 10 L/kg of coffee for dark-roasted coffee, is not released because it is harmful to the flavour—quite the contrary, it protects the beans against oxidation, but <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> could damage the container. Reported experience is that {{a few days of}} carbon dioxide release is needed between roasting and brewing for best results. There is also informed opinion that storage of freshly roasted beans in a can pressurized with nitrogen gas, with <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> buildup vented via a relief valve, provides optimal storage for extended periods, while promoting a beneficial aging effect related to distribution of natural oils by the pressure.|$|R

40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R

40|$|Proportional {{pressure}} regulators are usually used in different automation processes where continuous pressure or force control is required.
