25|$|Although the Central American oncilla {{is listed}} as a {{separate}} subspecies, based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA, <b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1999) found strongly supported differences between L.t. oncilla in Costa Rica and L.t. guttulus in southern Brazil, comparable to differences between different neotropical species. Researchers have argued {{that there should be}} a splitting of the oncilla into two species, as there is a pronounced difference in appearance between the oncillas in Costa Rica and those in central and southern Brazil. The level of divergence between oncillas from Costa Rica and from central and southern Brazil suggests that the two populations have been isolated, perhaps by the Amazon River, for approximately 3.7 million years. Further samples of L.t. oncilla are needed from northern South America to determine whether this taxon ranges outside Central America, and whether it should be considered a distinct species rather than a subspecies.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that as people age {{they will become}} less internal and more external, but data here have been ambiguous. Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel (cited in <b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2004) imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter. Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) (for example, Heckhausen and Schulz (1995) or Ryckman and Malikosi, 1975) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.|$|E
25|$|There {{are places}} other than sport {{that can be}} {{affected}} by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph <b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process. To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three hypotheses were made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning {{would be more likely to}} buy a stock that was positive when it was first getting started but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, other {{psychological}} constructs suggest further {{limits on}} how context can affect memory.

50|$|Ribeiroia is a genus of parasites in {{the class}} Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. Currently three species and one {{subspecies}} of Ribeiroia are recognized: R. ondatrae in North America, R. marini in the Caribbean, R. m. guadeloupensis on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, and R. congolensis in Africa (<b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004). The trematode Cercaria lileta is also closely related to Ribeiroia, and molecular sequence data indicates {{that it may be}} a species of Ribeiroia (<b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004). All species of Ribeiroia share the distinctive morphological characteristic of esophageal diverticula (i.e., two short dead-end branches that extend laterally from the esophagus). Other genera closely related to Ribeiroia include Cladocystis trifolium, Cathemasia, and Echinostoma (<b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004). See <b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2004) for more details on morphological and ecological differences as well as phylogenetic relationships between these species.|$|E

50|$|Bio{{diversity}} - Host {{species diversity}} and community structure {{have been suggested}} to influence disease dynamics through a hypothesis termed the ‘dilution effect’ (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). For Ribeiroia ondatrae, host species differences in susceptibility can influence infection patterns in multi-species communities (<b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008, Johnson and Hartson 2009). As a result, more diverse larval amphibian communities that include species with differing susceptibilities can alter parasite infection success and the resulting pathology in sensitive host species. For instance, larval toads (a sensitive species) raised experimentally alongside larval gray treefrogs (a resistant species) exhibited 37% less infection and fewer malformations (<b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008).|$|E

40|$|Porous {{materials}} are commonly applied in sound absorption in different places. Transmission loss, {{one of the}} vital parameters determining {{the performance of the}} material, will change when the material is compressed. Usually the compression that might affect the properties to the greatest extent are normal compression and the deformation can be simplified as 1 D compression model. In order to verify the prediction, some formulas taking several parameters (porosity, tortuosity, flow resistivity and characteristic lengths) into account are applied and also the <b>Johnson</b> <b>et</b> <b>al’s</b> model of limp structure. Dynamic density of limp model and bulk modulus are thus obtained and to get the mathematical expression of the transmission coefficient and transmission loss, acoustic equations including Euler equation are applied to the boundary conditions between the material and the fluid (air in the experiment). The numerical predictions are later compared with experimental data collected with 4 -mic 2 -load measurement on Kundt standard impedance tube.
