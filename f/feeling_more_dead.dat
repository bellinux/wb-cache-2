60|$|This {{coincident}} {{collapse of}} both {{religious and political}} idealism produced a curious cold air of emptiness and real subconscious agnosticism such as is extremely unusual {{in the history of}} mankind. It is what Mr. Wells, with his usual verbal delicacy and accuracy, spoke of as that ironical silence that follows a great controversy. It is what people less intelligent than Mr. Wells meant by calling themselves fin de siècle; though, of course, rationally speaking, there is no more reason for being sad towards the end of a hundred years than towards the end of five hundred fortnights. There was no arithmetical autumn, but there was a spiritual one. And it came from the fact suggested in the paragraphs above; the sense that man's two great inspirations had failed him together. The Christian religion was much <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> in the eighteenth century {{than it was in the}} nineteenth century. But the republican enthusiasm was also much more alive. If their scepticism was cold, and their faith even colder, their practical politics were wildly idealistic; and if they doubted the kingdom of heaven, they were gloriously credulous about the chances of it coming on earth. In the same way the old pagan republican <b>feeling</b> was much <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> in the feudal darkness of the eleventh or twelfth centuries, than it was even a century later; but if creative politics were at their lowest, creative theology was almost at its highest point of energy.|$|R

40|$|We are {{familiar}} with both pleasant and unpleasant psychotropic effects of movements associated with vestibular stimulation. However, {{there has been no}} attempt to scientifically explore the impact of different kinds of vestibular stimulation on mood states and biomarkers. A sample of 23 healthy volunteers were subjected to a random sequence of three different passive rotational (yaw, pitch, roll) and translational (heave, sway, surge) vestibular stimulation paradigms using a motion-simulator (hexapod). Mood states were measured by means of questionnaires and visual analog scales. In addition, saliva cortisol and α-amylase samples were taken. Compared to a subliminal control paradigm all rotational and two translational stimulations produced significant changes in mood states: Yaw rotation was associated with <b>feeling</b> <b>more</b> comfortable, pitch rotation with <b>feeling</b> <b>more</b> alert and energetic, and roll rotation with feeling less comfortable. Heave translation was associated with <b>feeling</b> <b>more</b> alert, less relaxed, and less comfortable and surge translation with <b>feeling</b> <b>more</b> alert. Biomarkers were not affected. In conclusion, we provide first experimental evidence that passive rotational and translational movements may influence mood states on a short-term basis and that the quality of these psychotropic effects may depend on the plane and axis of the respective movements...|$|R
