Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>who</b> started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
