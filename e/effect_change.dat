5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to <b>effect</b> <b>change.</b> Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E

Schiavo discusses the average ages of certain airline fleets, reveals the accident rates of the major airline carriers, safety ratings at national airlines, bomb detection rates at U.S. airports, and provides a list of airports where power failures have affected the effectiveness of control towers. She concludes with a list of recommendations for how individuals can <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> at government agencies including the FAA, and how to address concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry.|$|E

25|$|As {{executive}} director of the League, Young pushed major corporations to hire more blacks.

25|$|Witchcraft or witchery broadly {{means the}} {{practice}} of and belief in magical skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups known as covens. Witchcraft is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus {{can be difficult to}} define with precision, therefore cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution.

25|$|When {{the strike}} campaign, from August 16 to September 22, 1989, {{failed to produce}} much of an effect in Chişinău, the OSTK re-examined its tactics. Smirnov and others saw the {{upcoming}} Moldovan elections {{as an opportunity to}} <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> through different means. Smirnov won two seats in the elections of February 1990, the 32nd district seat for the city soviet (municipal government) of Tiraspol and the 125th district seat for the Supreme Soviet of MSSR (republican government) in 1990 Moldovan parliamentary election. Once in the city soviet, Smirnov ran for chairmanship of that body. In a dramatic demonstration of how much the Communist Party's power had waned, Smirnov beat his challenger, the First Secretary of the city's Party Committee, Leonid Tsurkan, by a 2-to-1 margin. From this time forward, Tiraspol was an OSTK-controlled city.|$|E
25|$|In general, Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is {{advantageous}} if {{the sample}} is sensitive to pH change or harsh solvents typically used in other types of chromatography but not high salt concentrations. Commonly, it {{is the amount of}} salt in the buffer which is varied. In 2012, Müller and Franzreb described the effects of temperature on HIC using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with four different types of hydrophobic resin. The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 degrees to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times. Using temperature to <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money.|$|E

On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> due to static policy directives in a tertiary role behind Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger and United States Secretary of State William P.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.|$|E

After Shuttlesworth was arrested and jailed for violating the city's segregation rules in 1962, he sent a petition to Mayor Art Hanes' office asking that public facilities be desegregated. Hanes responded with a letter informing Shuttlesworth that his petition had been thrown in the garbage. Looking for outside help, Shuttlesworth invited Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC to Birmingham, saying, [...] "If you come to Birmingham, you will not only gain prestige, but really shake the country.
