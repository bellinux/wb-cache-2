King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli {{does not know how}} to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is {{demolished}} to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan <b>is</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.|$|E

2500|$|International {{sex tourism}} and child sex tourism remains an issue, {{especially}} on the islands of Batam and Karimun and in major urban centres and tourist destinations across the country, including Bali and Riau Islands. Sex tourism is nothing new in Southeast Asia. Unlike neighbouring Thailand with its visible red light districts, Indonesia do not market their sex tourism in that way, yet prostitution <b>is</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> Indonesia prostitution is illegal and interpreted as a [...] "crime against decency and morality" [...] and against the law. In practice prostitution is quite widespread, tolerated and somewhat regulated, mostly illegally or underground in discotheques, massage parlours, and karaoke rooms, and also visible on certain streets. It is estimated 40,000 to 70,000 Indonesian children are being exploited in prostitution within the country. Prostitution is conducted by both female and male, Bali for example is notorious for its 'Kuta Cowboys', local gigolos targeting foreign female tourists.|$|E

2500|$|Little known {{during his}} {{lifetime}} beyond a small circle of his devotees, Watteau [...] "was mentioned but seldom in contemporary art criticism and then usually reprovingly". Sir Michael Levey once noted that Watteau [...] "created, unwittingly, {{the concept of the}} individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone". If his immediate followers (Lancret and Pater) would depict the unabashed frillery of aristocratic romantic pursuits, Watteau in a few masterpieces anticipates an art about art, the world of art as seen through the eyes of an artist. In contrast to the Rococo whimsicality and licentiousness cultivated by Boucher and Fragonard in the later part of Louis XV's reign, Watteau's theatrical panache is usually tinged with a note of sympathy, wistfulness, and sadness at the transience of love and other earthly delights. [...] Famously, the Victorian essayist Walter Pater wrote of Watteau: [...] "He was always a seeker after something in the world, that <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> no satisfying measure, or not at all." ...|$|E

He started a huge program of construction and renovation, the remnants of which can still be seen in North Central Province, Sri Lanka, today. It is mentioned of him as having restored an ancient causeway called the Kotabaddha, over the Deduru Oya (Deduru Lake) near modern Kurunegala. The new king's personality was illustrated when the architects commissioned to the project informed him that it was well-nigh impossible to carry out, to which Parākramabāhu replied that [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the world that cannot be carried out by people of energy?". He ordered the construction of canals and dams, and cleared a large area of forest around them for new fields. Most notably, he constructed the Parakrama Samudra, a giant reservoir from which a large swathe of territory derived its water supply. On islands in the middle of the reservoir he constructed a palace and a stupa.|$|E
