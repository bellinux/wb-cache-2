500|$|The {{disqualification}} upset South Korean supporters, {{many of whom}} directed {{their anger}} at Ohno and the International Olympic Committee. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the Olympic Committee's <b>email</b> <b>server,</b> and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the committee. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, [...] "I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot {{of my best friends}} were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me to stand on the pedestal as the anti-American sentiment". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E
500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private <b>email</b> <b>server</b> while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|E

The server was set up in her home in Chappaqua, New York. The matter gained widespread public attention due to concerns about the security of the mails she sent and received and whether they were exposed to hacking and surveillance; the availability and preservation of the mails for Freedom of Information Act requests and the archival historical record; and whether her action had violated any federal laws, regulations, or guidelines. Also in question was whether the use of the private <b>email</b> <b>server</b> violated State Department transparency protocols.|$|E
