5|$|Globally, but {{especially}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations</b> like India where people cook with fuelwood and coal over open fires, about 4billion humans suffer continuous exposure to smoke. In India, particulate concentrations in houses {{are reported to}} range from 8,300 to 15,000 μg/m3, greatly exceeding the 75 μg/m3 maximum standard for indoor particulate matter in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Earth's human {{population}} reached approximately seven billion on 31 October 2011. Projections {{indicate that the}} world's {{human population}} will reach 9.2billion in 2050. Most of the growth {{is expected to take}} place <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b> Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion people <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations</b> lack clean, {{safe water}} because most {{household}} and industrial wastes are dumped directly into {{rivers and lakes}} without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>developed</b> <b>nations,</b> {{neglected}} {{tropical disease}} also {{pose a threat}} to human health. In the United States alone, there are at least 12 million people suffering from these neglected parasitic infections.

5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b> Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry-level}} 200 {{series was}} expanded with six new processors using 28 nanometer manufacturing and dual or quad-core options in June 2013. The Snapdragon 805 was released that November. The 410, which {{is intended for}} low-cost phones <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations,</b> was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced {{a modified version of}} the Snapdragon 600 called 602A that is intended for in-car infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad-core Snapdragon 610 and eight-core 615 were announced in February 2014. The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The newest iteration in Snapdragon 800 series is Snapdragon 835, which is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10nm architecture. As of October 2016, the Snapdragon 835 contained the fastest processor in the Snapdragon line.|$|E

50|$|Following World War II, {{synthetic}} fertilizer use increased rapidly, while sustainable intensive farming advanced much more slowly. Most {{of the resources}} <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>nations</b> went to improving industrial intensive farming, and very little went to improving organic farming. Thus, particularly <b>in</b> the <b>developed</b> <b>nations,</b> industrial intensive farming grew to become the dominant form of agriculture.|$|R

25|$|Gender and sex {{are also}} {{components}} of health disparity {{in the female}} population. The 2012 World Development Report (WDR) noted that women <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations</b> experience greater mortality rates than men <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b> Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden--a disparity that {{is much greater than}} that for neonatal or child mortality.|$|E
25|$|If {{reusable}} waste fractions {{are handled}} in waste processing {{plants such as}} incinerators <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations,</b> it would cut out viable work for local economies. It is estimated that there are 1 million people making a livelihood off collecting waste.|$|E

50|$|In {{their natural}} form (as in whole grain), cereals are {{a rich source}} of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, oils, and protein. When refined by the removal of the bran and germ, the {{remaining}} endosperm is mostly carbohydrate. <b>In</b> some <b>developing</b> <b>nations,</b> grain <b>in</b> the form of rice, wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. <b>In</b> <b>developed</b> <b>nations,</b> cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still substantial.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} purely {{technological}} advances cassettes brought, they {{also served as}} catalysts for social change. Their durability and ease of copying helped bring underground rock and punk music behind the Iron Curtain, creating a foothold for Western culture among the younger generations.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the citizens waiting for organ transplants in the U.S. and other developed nations, there are long waiting lists {{in the rest of}} the world. More than 2 million people need organ transplants in China, 50,000 waiting in Latin America (90% of which are waiting for kidneys), as well as thousands more in the less documented continent of Africa. Donor bases vary <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Accreditation systems {{vary widely}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b> In Mexico El Consejo Nacional de Educación de la Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia (CONEVET) accredits {{veterinary}} medical colleges, although few schools are accredited. The accreditation system is poor (or nonexistent) in other developing nations; Ethiopia {{has focused on}} building veterinary medical colleges rather than accrediting existing schools. With almost no accreditation system, the country's veterinary education is poor.|$|E

25|$|Pollution {{is often}} classed as point source or nonpoint source {{pollution}}. Point source pollution occurs {{when there is}} a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations.</b> Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural runoff and wind blown debris are prime examples.|$|E
25|$|The form {{of elderly}} care {{provided}} varies greatly among countries and is changing rapidly. Even {{within the same}} country, regional differences exist {{with respect to the}} care for the elderly. However, it has been observed that the global elderly consume the most health expenditures out of any other age group, observation that shows comprehensive eldercare may be very similar. One must also account for an increasingly large proportion of global elderly, especially <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>nations,</b> as continued pressure is put on limiting fertility and decreasing family size.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement among {{experts in the}} field that disability is more common <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> than <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>nations.</b> The connection between disability and poverty is thought {{to be part of a}} [...] "vicious cycle" [...] in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing.|$|R
5000|$|Along with {{disclosure}} of ingredients, some mandatory labelling of origins of clothing or food is required <b>in</b> all <b>developed</b> <b>nations.</b> This practice {{has been extended}} <b>in</b> some <b>developing</b> <b>nations,</b> e.g., where every item carries the name, phone number and fax number of the factory where it was made so a buyer can inspect its conditions. And, more importantly, {{to prove that the}} item was not made by [...] "prison labor", use of which to produce export goods is banned <b>in</b> most <b>developed</b> <b>nations.</b> Such labels have also been used for boycotts, as when the merchandise mark Made in Germany was introduced in 1887.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>developed</b> <b>nations,</b> it was {{considered}} rare before 2003. However, a recent outbreak in the Netherlands among gay men {{has led to an}} increase of LGV in Europe and the United States. A majority of these patients are HIV co-infected.|$|R
