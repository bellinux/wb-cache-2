500|$|Farsari did {{not work}} in isolation. The works (particularly those that were hand-coloured) and {{practices}} of the many foreign and Japanese commercial photographers who operated in Yokohama from the 1860s to the 1880s have been termed Yokohama shashin (literally, [...] "Yokohama photographs" [...] or [...] "photography"). Farsari and its other practitioners [...] notably Beato, Stillfried, Tamamura, Kusakabe Kimbei, Ogawa Kazumasa, and Uchida Kuichi [...] produced works that in their subject matter, composition and colouring present a striking combination of the conventions and techniques of Western photography with those of Japanese artistic traditions, particularly ukiyo-e. These photographers also provided the key images by which Meiji-era Japan and the Japanese were known to people in other countries. Their images also changed {{the ways in which}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> their own country. Through their images, foreign photographers publicised sites that interested them, sometimes drawing Japanese attention to hitherto neglected locations. One was the now-important [...] "Daibutsu" [...] (great Buddha) at Kōtoku-in, Kamakura. In a similar vein, Farsari's and others' photographs of the mausoleums of Tōshō-gū made the once restricted site familiar to a wider audience.|$|E

60|$|The British Legation, however, {{supported}} Yuan Shi-k'ai, {{against both}} the Manchus and Sun Yat Sen; {{and it was}} the British policy which won the day. Yuan Shi-k'ai became President, and remained so until 1915. He was strongly anti-Japanese, and had, on that ground, been opposed as strongly as Japan dared. His success was therefore a blow to the influence of Japan in China. If the Western Powers had remained free to make themselves felt in the Far East, the course of events would doubtless have been much less favourable to the Japanese; but the war came, and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> their chance. How they used it must be told in a separate chapter.|$|E

5000|$|Dōzuki [...] - [...] a Japanese backsaw, {{used for}} centuries by {{carpenters}} and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although this saw {{does not share}} an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most <b>Japanese</b> <b>saws,</b> the dōzuki cuts on the pull stroke, allowing for much straighter and narrower cuts than those achieved with push-stroke saws. This is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.|$|R

[...] During the Japanese forced {{occupation}} (1910-1945), the <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> chǎomǎmiàn in Chinese restaurants in Korea and named it chanpon, {{as the white}} soup seemed similar to the soup of chanpon to their eyes. The Japanese word sounded like jjamppong to Korean ears. Addition of gochutgaru (chili powder) and chili oil in jjamppong began in the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The Imperial National Defense Policy of 1907 {{directed}} {{the focus of}} Japan's military away from Imperial Russia, whom they had defeated {{in the war of}} 1905, to the United States, who had negotiated the peace agreement embodied in the Treaty of Portsmouth, an agreement the <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> as unfavorable. Japanese ambitions to lead Asia were looked upon with suspicion by the United States. The U.S. Open Door Policy towards China was a clear check against Japanese aspirations on the Asian mainland. In this setting the naval planners who shaped strategies in both countries began working out scenarios for how a future conflict in the Pacific might be fought and won.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{contact with}} the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) began when China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates in coastal areas of China. Japanese pirates of this era and region were {{referred}} to as wokou by the Chinese (Japanese wakō). Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wokou threat, Yoshimitsu accepted {{a relationship with the}} Chinese that was to last for half a century. In 1401 he restarted the tribute system, describing himself {{in a letter to the}} Chinese Emperor as [...] "Your subject, the King of Japan". Japanese wood, sulfur, copper ore, swords, and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk, porcelain, books, and coins, in what the Chinese considered tribute but the <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> as profitable trade.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (...) [...] On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vise or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|E
5000|$|Born in the Keumangan chiefdom of Pidië regency, {{he began}} from 1930 to {{champion}} {{a more modern}} form of Islamic school, and to become a popular reformist preacher. In 1939 he established and lead the Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (PUSA), or All Aceh Islamic Scholars Association. PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of uléëbalang (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their 1942 invasion, {{in the hope of}} overturning uléëbalang rule as a reward for their support. As the <b>Japanese</b> <b>saw</b> a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the uléëbalang to religious courts headed by Daud. After the Japanese surrender this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the uléëbalang and the killing of many in December 1945. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the Indonesian Republic's struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause. He was recognised as Military Governor in 1947, and Governor once independence was won in 1950.|$|E
