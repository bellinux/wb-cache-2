40|$|Using {{detailed}} {{data on the}} currency transactions of institutional fund managers, this paper shows that funds that experience high returns on their currency holdings also incur lower transaction costs on their currency trades.

The results are consistent with <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>dealers</b> bidding for information from successful traders. They are also consistent with <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>dealers</b> exploiting price inelastic demand for foreign currency trades, or funds acting as secondary liquidity providers in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> markets.

It analyzes the results of a questionnaire survey on chartism conducted among chief <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>dealers</b> in the London market and data on a panel of chartists' one-week and four-week-ahead exchange rate predictions.

This study addresses this empirical difficulty {{in the context}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>dealers.</b> New evidence is presented rejecting the latter models' specifications of how information asymmetry and inventory accumulation affect dealer pricing. This rejection is consistent with those of other dealer-level empirical studies. A new modeling avenue may be to reconsider optimal price setting while relaxing assumptions that specify incoming orders as the only component through which dealer inventories evolve. This approach is consistent with inventory evolution data and with market-level models' assumptions about currency markets. Copyright 2005, International Monetary Fund...|$|R
40|$|Intra-day {{interest}} rates are zero. Consequently, a <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>dealer</b> can short a vulnerable currency in the morning, close this position in the afternoon, and never face an interest cost. This tactic might seem especially attractive in times of crisis, since it suggests an immunity to the central bank's interest rate defence. In equilibrium, however, buyers of the vulnerable currency must be compensated on average with an intra-day capital gain, as long as no devaluation occurs. That is, currencies under attack should typically appreciate intra-day. Using data on intra-day exchange rate changes within the European Monetary System, we find this prediction is borne out.
