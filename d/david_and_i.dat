500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time <b>David</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was always doing amphetamines and stuff. He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , <b>David</b> , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to start all over again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E

[...] And she indicated with her hand, laughing, dear David's red wig and false sandy whiskers, as we felt convinced they must be now. She looked at them and tittered. Her manner at this moment was anything but shy. In fact, I will venture to say, it was that of a bold and brazen-faced hoyden.|$|E

6000|$|Of course, it was {{possible}} that he had not seen me; but for some reason his attitude struck me as ominous. As far as I could see, he was looking straight at me, and he was not a short-sighted man. I could think of no reason why he should cut me. We had met on the links on the previous morning, and he had been friendliness itself. He had called me [...] "me dear boy," [...] supplied me with a gin and gingerbeer at the clubhouse, and generally behaved {{as if he had been}} <b>David</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Jonathan.

60|$|The fairies are {{exquisite}} dancers, {{and that}} is why {{one of the first things}} the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it. They hold their great balls in the open air, in what is called a fairy ring. For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass. It is not there when they begin, but they make it by waltzing round and round. Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring, and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away. The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little people leave behind them, and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates. <b>David</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> once found a fairy ring quite warm.|$|E
60|$|When {{they think}} you are not looking they skip along pretty lively, {{but if you look}} and they fear there is no time to hide, they stand quite still, pretending to be flowers. Then, after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies, they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure. The Fairy Basin, you remember, is all covered with ground-ivy (from which they make their castor-oil), with flowers growing in it here and there. Most of them really are flowers, but some of them are fairies. You never can be sure of them, but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round sharply. Another good plan, which <b>David</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} follow, is to stare them down. After a long time they can't help winking, and then you know for certain that they are fairies.|$|E
60|$|His {{delivery}} is underarm and not inelegant, but he sometimes tries a round-arm ball, which I have seen double up the fielder at square leg. He has {{not a good}} length, but he varies his action bewilderingly, and has one especially teasing ball which falls from the branches just as you have stepped out of your ground to look for it. It was not, however, with his teaser that he bowled me that day. I had notched a three and two singles, when he sent me down a medium to fast which got me in two minds and I played back to it too late. Now, I am seldom out on a really grassy wicket for such a meagre score, and as <b>David</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> changed places without a word, there was a cheery {{look on his face}} that I found very galling. He ran in to my second ball and cut it neatly to the on for a single, and off my fifth and sixth he had two pretty drives for three, both behind the wicket. This, however, as I hoped, proved the undoing of him, for he now hit out confidently at everything, and with his score at nine I beat him with my shooter.|$|E
