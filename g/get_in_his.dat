5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E

Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E

Tetsuo breaks open the underground cryogenic chamber and frees Akira, who {{turns out to be}} an ordinary-looking little boy. The terror of seeing Akira causes one of the Colonel's men to declare a state of emergency that causes massive panic in Neo-Tokyo. The Colonel himself tries to use SOL, a laser satellite, to kill Tetsuo and Akira, but only succeeds in severing Tetsuo's arm.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1955 and 1956, Nasser {{pursued a}} number of {{policies}} that would frustrate British aims throughout the Middle East, and result in increasing hostility between Britain and Egypt. Nasser saw Iraq's inclusion in the Baghdad Pact as indicating that the United States and Britain had sided with his much hated archenemy Nuri as-Said's efforts {{to be the leader}} of the Arab world, and much of the motivation for Nasser's turn to an active anti-Western policy starting in 1955 was due to his displeasure with the Baghdad Pact. For Nasser, attendance at such events as the Bandung conference in April 1955 served as both the means of striking a posture as a global leader, and of playing hard to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> talks with the Americans, especially his demand that the United States sell him vast quantities of arms.|$|E

25|$|In Naoya's 8th Day, the Protagonist {{learns that}} Metatron is holding Tokyo hostage and {{extending}} the lockdown, forcing the remaining demon tamers {{to kill the}} new Overlord. If the Protagonist chooses to avoid killing the demon tamers, {{the people in the}} lockdown will gradually see the angels as their true enemy. This culminates in Yuzu, Amane, and Captain Izuna rallying the people in the Yamanote Circle behind the Overlord in opposition to God's tyranny. After defeating Metatron, the Protagonist soon leaves to rally the demons in a war against the Heavenly Host. If the Protagonist chooses to kill both the demon tamers and angels that <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way, he soon becomes feared by the humans in the lockdown. This results in Yuzu and Midori allying with Metatron in an attempt to stop him. Once he is defeated, the Overlord soon extends his power to Japan and soon the rest of the human world, gradually uniting them as a single nation under his despotic rule before waging war against YHWH Himself.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E

25|$|On the January 26, {{episode of}} Raw, Goldberg {{came to the}} ring, and demanded a match between himself against Brock Lesnar, {{with whom he had}} {{problems}} over the past two months. The night before, Goldberg was entered in the Royal Rumble match, only to have Lesnar (who, as the reigning WWE Champion, was not entered into the match) interfered and hit an F-5, causing Goldberg to be eliminated by Kurt Angle. The following week on an episode of Raw, {{as a result of the}} rivalry extending between the two programs, sheriff Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front-row ticket. At No Way Out, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his front seat by security. Then SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! was the better program over Raw. Lesnar would come down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a running shoulder block to Goldberg's stomach; however he recuperated and lifted Lesnar vertically in the air before slamming him down to perform the Jackhammer. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security. During Lesnar's WWE title defense against Eddie Guerrero later that night, Goldberg returned to the arena and interfered by executing a spear, which caused Lesnar to lose the title after Guerrero nailed him with a Frog splash. On the February 22, 2004 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon named the Interpromotional singles match pitting Lesnar versus Goldberg for WrestleMania XX with Steve Austin as the special guest referee. During the match between McMahon and Eric Bischoff, Lesnar appeared on Raw and nailed Steve Austin with an F-5 then stole Austin's four-wheeler. A few days later on SmackDown!, Lesnar stated that he appeared on Raw just to get back at Austin for giving Goldberg the front-row seat ticket and suggesting that Goldberg would attack Lesnar at No Way Out. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match would be Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, however, rumors surfaced that Lesnar, too, was leaving in order to pursue a career in the National Football League. On the last episode of SmackDown! prior to WrestleMania, Steve Austin appeared to get his fourwheeler back from Lesnar only for the entire roster to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way by orders of SmackDown! General manager Paul Heyman. Moments later, the entire roster had decided to move aside and let Austin by to confront Lesnar in the ring. As Austin got to the ring, he and Lesnar traded punches with Austin attempting to nail Lesnar with the Stone Cold stunner only for Lesnar to escape, leaving Austin to finally get back his fourwheeler and closing in on the show with his trademark beer bash.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media critics.

500|$|Harry Connick Sr., the New Orleans {{district}} attorney who defeated Garrison in 1973, criticized Stone's {{view of the}} assassination: [...] "Stone was either unaware of the details and particulars of the Clay Shaw investigation and trial or, if he was aware, that didn't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way of what he {{perceived to be the}} way the case should have been." [...] In his book , a history of the assassination published 16 years after the film's release, Vincent Bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to Garrison's prosecution of Shaw and Stone's subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate [...] "lies and fabrications" [...] in Stone's film and describes the film as [...] "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn't find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go." [...] David Wrone stated that [...] "80 percent of the film is in factual error" [...] and rejected the premise of a conspiracy involving the CIA and the so-called military-industrial complex as [...] "irrational." [...] Warren Commission investigator David Belin called the film [...] "a big lie that would make Adolf Hitler proud".|$|E

Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were."

For Chad, the revelation allows him to see Mia's true colors.

[...] "It's a very hard situation." [...] Of his character during the storyline, Deidrick described Chad as a [...] "kid who doesn't know what to do and he's a fighting all these feelings." [...] Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything [...] "into place." [...] The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself {{and the rest of his}} teenage costars. When asked about a future love interest, Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez (Gabriela Rodriguez) but didn't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference.|$|E
