5|$|Furthermore, South Vietnamese commanders never {{realized}} that <b>Hanoi</b> had given its field commanders the full flexibility {{to respond to}} the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied North Vietnamese units with weaponry that was required to achieve their objectives.

5|$|In 1959, <b>Hanoi</b> {{established}} the 559th Transportation Group {{under the command}} of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the NLF uprising against the South Vietnamese government.

40|$|An {{authentic}} {{sense of}} place, {{according to the}} Canadian place theorist Edward Relph, is often found in the experiences of painters who attempt to convey their personal attitude to place through their artworks. 1 Taking this idea {{as a point of}} departure, this article sheds some light on one aspect of the aesthetics of architecture through an examination of the interrelationship between a visual art, architecture, and place. To illustrate some of the ways that place identity and local architecture are presented in paintings, we look at the work of two of <b>Hanoi's</b> painters: Bui Xuan Phai (1921 – 1988), a French-trained painter who is famous for his paintings of <b>Hanoi's</b> ancient streets in the 1960 s, 1970 s, and 1980 s, and surrealist artist Nguyen Manh Hung (b. 1976), whose paintings reflect more recent changes to <b>Hanoi's</b> built environment. This article discusses these artists’ work with reference to their personal experiences with the city. It suggests how the study of paintings of <b>Hanoi's</b> architecture may contribute to the understanding of <b>Hanoi's</b> sense of place by bringing to consciousness details that might otherwise be repressed or simply go unnoticed. We first describe certain characteristics of <b>Hanoi's</b> streets and buildings in {{the past and the present}} that put the discussion of the paintings and the sense of place they communicate in context. Given that painting is a powerful form of aesthetic expression, this article suggests that paintings of <b>Hanoi's</b> cityscape and its architecture can contribute significantly to the understanding of <b>Hanoi's</b> sense of place. The artists' different approaches to painting suggest both that <b>Hanoi's</b> sense of place has shifted in response to socioeconomic and political changes caused by foreign interventions and that the local culture, with its routine patterns of village life, still greatly influences the city's architectural character. It is, then, important for us to offer some background concerning these influences, not the least of which is war, as war can bring about both urban destruction and reconstruction, and, therefore, war and its subsequent politics can change the identity of place for the victors as well as the victims, which in this case were one and the same people...|$|R

5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to <b>Hanoi</b> {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in <b>Hanoi</b> during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Service des Travaux Publics carried out random excavations.

5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort.

Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless <b>Hanoi</b> felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter <b>Hanoi</b> from its goal.|$|E

5|$|A {{maritime}} route {{opened up}} with the Chinese-controlled port of Rinan in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the Khmer kingdom of Funan by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier. Jiaozhi was proposed by Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877 {{to have been the}} port known to the Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy as Cattigara, situated near modern <b>Hanoi.</b> Ptolemy wrote that Cattigara lay beyond the Golden Chersonese (the Malay Peninsula) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as <b>Hanoi</b> was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at Óc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City) in the Mekong Delta during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location. Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems to correspond with the latitude of modern Óc Eo, where Roman goods and native jewellery imitating Antonine Roman coins have been found. At Óc Eo, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his successor Marcus Aurelius. Ancient Roman glass beads and bracelets were also found at the site.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that <b>Hanoi</b> had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on <b>Hanoi.</b> During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{operation}} went well, with little {{resistance from the}} North Vietnamese.

5|$|By 1953, the First Indochina War was {{not going}} well for France. A {{succession}} of commanders— Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Jean Étienne Valluy, Roger Blaizot, Marcel Carpentier, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Raoul Salan— had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the Viet Minh fighting for independence. During their 1952–53 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of Laos, a French ally and Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as Luang Prabang and the Plain of Jars. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the <b>Hanoi</b> delta region {{to prepare for a}} series of offensives against Viet Minh staging areas in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including Lai Châu near the Chinese border to the north, Nà Sản to the west of <b>Hanoi,</b> and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that <b>Hanoi</b> could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, <b>Hanoi</b> could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside.
