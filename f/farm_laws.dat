50|$|Right to <b>farm</b> <b>laws</b> in the United States deny {{nuisance}} {{lawsuits against}} farmers who use accepted and standard farming practices {{and have been}} in prior operation even if these practices harm or bother adjacent property owners or the general public. Agricultural nuisances may include noise, odors, visual clutter and dangerous structures. All 50 states {{have some form of}} Right to Farm law.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{of these}} laws were passed after 1980 because of the {{reduction}} of available farmland, adversity from private and public nuisance actions, which hinder the prospect of farming. The laws are aimed to minimize the threat to normal farming practices from nuisance litigation and prohibitive {{state and local government}} regulation. In contrast to typical farmland preservation policies, which aim to preserve farmland itself, Right to <b>Farm</b> <b>laws</b> attempt to preserve the agricultural practices and enhance farm viability.|$|E

50|$|Right to <b>farm</b> <b>laws</b> vary {{across the}} nation. They are {{intended}} to bolster the legitimacy of agricultural concerns, defend farmers rights without undue outside interference, and minimize or resolve public and private land use conflicts. In a broader sense the notion originally referred to relief {{from all kinds of}} undue interference, usually involving legal interpretations focused on nuisance issues such as noise, odors, environmental, visual, farm technology, etc. This is partly because it is a modification of the common law doctrine of nuisance. Common law nuisances are seen as private or public nuisances. A public nuisance impairs the health, safety, morals, and comfort of the general community without necessarily harming particular property rights in any kind way. A private nuisance unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of another's land.|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{government}} has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They {{can be found in}} the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles. They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices. Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out. They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential. Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.States have police powers granted by the Constitution. They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances. California [...] and New Jersey have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not. One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation and right to <b>farm</b> <b>laws</b> that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{utilization}} of right to farm policies for corporate agriculture {{can be considered}} a 'wicked problem'. These problems are shaped by [...] "dynamic social and political factors as well as biophysical complexities", and an array of local, state, and government stakeholders. These diverse actors result in a high degree of variability in terms of defining what is protected under respective right to <b>farm</b> <b>laws.</b> Thus, although the initial intention of such policies was to preserve the nation's agrarian roots and support the small-scale farmer, potential for misappropriation exists. Public sentiment expresses concern that the literature in these policies may prevent localities and states from regulating any number of agriculture based issues, essentially grant corporations immunity from environmental and ecological consequences resulting from their practices. In 2014, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—a Koch-brothers organization which writes legislation on behalf of major multi-billion dollar corporations such as ExxonMobil, Pfizer, AT&T, SAP SE, and State Farm Insurance, among others—financially backed Missouri's Right-to-Farm amendment (Amendment 1), fueling further controversy that Right-to-Farm laws are being enacted to assist corporate agriculture, not small family-owned farms and the traditional farming practices used by small farm owners. In November 2016, Oklahoma voters defeated a Right-to-Farm bill (State Question 777) which garnered just 39.7 percent of the vote. State Question 777 was heavily backed by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau and by voters in the Oklahoma panhandle where the giant multinational agribusiness Seaboard Corporation has a pork production plant.|$|E

40|$|As {{researchers}} {{in the field of}} agri-food studies turn their attention to the institutional mechanisms that enable indus-trial agri-food systems to persist in spite of their ecological contradictions, environmental regulation is likely to become an increasingly important topic (Harrison 2008; Harrison and Wolf 2008). That regulatory systems contribute to the resilience of regulated industries is nowhere more apparent than in the industrial livestock and poultry feeding sectors. State legislatures in the United States have enacted right to <b>farm</b> <b>laws</b> that shield livestock and poultry feeding opera-tions from nuisance lawsuits. State legislatures have also enacted environmental statutes that pre-empt the authority of municipalities to ban feeding operations or regulate them more stringently than they are regulated by state and federal law.

50|$|The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185) was {{separate}} {{legislation that}} revised and reauthorized federally supported agricultural research, education, and extension programs from June 1998 through May 2002 (historically, these authorities {{have been part}} of an omnibus <b>farm</b> policy <b>law</b> enacted every 4 to 6 years). The 1998 Act built upon reforms that were made in the research title of the <b>farm</b> <b>law</b> in effect at the time, the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127). Key provisions were new accountability measures for recipients of federal research funds, and a new competitive research grant program called the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, for which mandatory funds were authorized (annually appropriated discretionary funds support most of USDA’s research, education and extension programs). The 1998 law’s provisions, as well as new revisions of research, education, and extension policies, are included in Title VII of the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171).|$|R
40|$|The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) {{was enacted}} in the United States in May of 2002. While this new <b>farm</b> <b>law</b> {{introduced}} some new policies to {{the array of}} agricultural commodity programs, {{in many ways the}} 2002 farm act extended provisions of the 1996 farm act and institutionalized provisions of ad hoc emergency spending bills of 1998 - 2001. Three key commodity program features of the 2002 farm act are marketing assistance loans, counter-cyclical payments, and direct payments. Marketing assistance loans existed under previous U. S. <b>farm</b> <b>law,</b> direct payments replaced production flexibility contract payments of the 1996 farm act, and counter-cyclical payments are intended to institutionalize the market loss assistance payments of the past several years. This paper discusses these U. S. farm programs and some of their potential impacts on agricultural markets. An overview of these programs features is first presented, along with an illustration of a con farm's sources of revenues under the new farm act. Then a discussion of some of the impacts of the 2002 farm act is given, commenting on the FAPRI analysis presented by John Kruse. Additional potential impacts of marketing loan provisions of the new law are then discussed, followed by some general comments on potential impacts of counter-cyclical payments, direct payments, and selected additional provisions of the legislation.
