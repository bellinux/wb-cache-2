25|$|By 1900 the Dallas {{population}} reached 38,000 as {{banking and}} insurance became major {{activities in the}} increasingly white-collar city, which was now the world's leading cotton center. It was also the world's center of harness making and leather goods. Businessmen took control of civic affairs; with little municipal patronage, {{there was only a}} small role for the Democratic Party to play. The predominantly black Republican Party was <b>essentially</b> <b>closed</b> out of politics by the disenfranchisement in 1901 of most blacks through imposition of a poll tax (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{neutrality}} of the United States {{was tested}} during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, President Thomas Jefferson {{was faced with}} a decision to make regarding the situation at hand. In the end, he chose an economic option: the Embargo Act of 1807. Jefferson <b>essentially</b> <b>closed</b> all the ports overnight, putting a damper on the seaport town of Salem. The embargo of 1807 was the starting point on the path to the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of American men and goods.|$|E

25|$|The hill's {{relative}} {{location to}} Route 9 gave the Rockpile an added significance. Route 9 is {{a road that}} runs parallel to the DMZ from Dong Ha, past the Rockpile, and on through Khe Sanh before becoming a dirt track that crosses the border into Laos. In addition, its location gave the American forces an upper hand in the defense and supply of Khe Sanh Combat Base, Ca Lu Combat Base, and Camp Carroll as {{it was possible to}} interdict potential ambushes along Route 9. Mountains positioned on either side of Route 9 near the Rockpile provided the NVA and VC with excellent cover to mount any ambushes against allied convoys travelling through the area. For these reasons the United States high command decided to keep the Rockpile and the surrounding area as secure as possible for several years {{during the height of the}} conflict. Ultimately, the United States' occupation of the Rockpile forced the NVA and VC to use higher and more dangerous infiltration routes to the west closer to Laos because the normal routes through the Cam Lo and Dong Ha area were <b>essentially</b> <b>closed</b> off.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{performances}} under Mengelberg {{during that}} period caused her difficulties {{at the end of}} the war. The Dutch maestro had performed in Germany with his Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra from the onset of the war through 1942 and thereafter continued performances in other occupied lands, resulting {{at the end of the}} war in a ban on his performances in the Netherlands for five years. This, in turn, resulted in Bustabo's arrest in Paris, when U.S. Army General George S. Patton discovered that she had played as soloist under Mengelberg during some of the performances in question, as well as other concerts in occupied territory. Her association with the conductor Oswald Kabasta, if it was known to Patton, could not have helped Bustabo's case, as Kabasta was known to be an ardent Nazi. [...] These charges, part of the denazification program, were later dropped. However, because of this situation a career in the US was <b>essentially</b> <b>closed</b> to her. She continued to perform in Europe during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

The ending is also slightly different from the original novel and for political correctness, some anachronistic snipes at the British Raj were inserted. The casting was also subject to controversy, with white actors playing local characters.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} progress made in both theoretical and experimental {{quantum key distribution}} (QKD), the security of current QKD implementations is still not yet established rigorously. One of the major causes of this impasse is that existing security analyses are strongly dependently on the classical-post-processing block size, and as a consequence, the resulting security bounds are unduly pessimistic. In other words, applying these security bounds to current QKD implementations would severely impair the efficiency of these implementations. In this thesis, we overcome this impasse by providing a novel security framework that allows one to derive tight non-asymtptotic security bounds {{on a wide range}} of QKD implementations. This <b>essentially</b> <b>closes</b> the gap between theory and practice of QKD...|$|R

50|$|Zirconium oxide is used {{due to its}} polymorphism. It {{exists in}} three phases: monoclinic, tetragonal and cubic. Cooling to the monoclinic phase after {{sintering}} causes a large volume change, which often causes stress fractures in pure zirconia. Additives such as magnesia, calcia and yttria {{are used in the}} manufacture of the knife material to stabilize the high-temperature phases and minimize this volume change. The highest strength and toughness is produced by the addition of 3 mol% yttrium oxide yielding partially stabilized zirconia. This material consists of a mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases with a bending strength of nearly 1,200 MPa. Small cracks allow phase transformations to occur, which <b>essentially</b> <b>close</b> the cracks and prevent catastrophic failure, resulting in a relatively tough ceramic material, sometimes known as TTZ (transformation-toughened zirconia).|$|R
