40|$|Manufacturing of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> {{customary}} implies use {{of metals}} such as zinc, magnesium, copper, and brass. In {{the case of}} short run lengths, a conventional manufacturing process and the material itself represent a significant cost, {{not only in the}} terms of material costs and the need for using complex technological systems which are necessary for their production, but also in the terms of the production time. Alternatively, 3 D printing can be used for manufacturing similar <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> with major savings in production time and costs. However, due to properties of materials used in the 3 D printing technology, expected results of embossing by 3 D printed tools cannot be identical to metal ones. This problem is emphasized in the case of long run lengths and high accuracy requirement for embossed elements. The objective of this paper is primarily focused on investigating the influence of the printing speed on reproduction quality of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> printed with FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) technology. The obtained results confirmed that printing speed as a process parameter affects the reproduction quality of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> printed with FDM technology: in the case of deposition rate of 90 mm/s was noted the poorest dimensional accuracy in relation to the 3 D model, which is more emphasised in case of circular and square elements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} continuum {{simulations of}} viscous polymer flow during nanoimprint lithography (NIL) for embossing tools having irregular spacings and sizes. Simulations varied non-uniform <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> geometry to distinguish geometric quantities governing cavity filling order, polymer peak deformation, and global mold filling times. A characteristic NIL velocity predicts cavity filling order. In general, small cavities fill {{more quickly than}} large cavities, while cavity spacing modulates polymer deformation mode. Individual cavity size, not total filling volume, dominates replication time, with large differences in individual cavity size resulting in non-uniform, squeeze flow filling. High density features can be modeled as a solid indenter in squeeze flow to accurately predict polymer flow and allow for optimization of wafer-scale replication.

In the present work we describe new applications and techniques of such "modulated digital images" (MDI&# 039;s) in document security. In particular, we demonstrate that multiple hidden images can be imperceptibly concealed within visible, host images by incorporating them as a new, half-tone, printing screen. Half-toned hidden images of this type may contain a variety of novel features that hinder unauthorized copying, including concealed multiple images, and microprinted-, color-, and various fade-effects.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} continuum {{simulations of}} polymer flow during nanoimprint lithography (NIL). The simulations capture the underlying physics of polymer {{flow from the}} nanometer to millimeter length scale and examine geometry and thermophysical process quantities affecting cavity filling. Variations in <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> geometry and polymer film thickness during viscous flow distinguish different flow driving mechanisms. Three parameters can predict polymer deformation mode: cavity width to polymer thickness ratio, polymer supply ratio, and Capillary number. The ratio of cavity width to initial polymer film thickness determines vertically or laterally dominant deformation. The ratio of indenter width to residual film thickness measures polymer supply beneath the indenter which determines Stokes or squeeze flow. The local geometry ratios can predict a fill time based on laminar flow between plates, Stokes flow, or squeeze flow. Characteristic NIL capillary number based on geometry-dependent fill time distinguishes between capillary or viscous driven flows. The three parameters predict filling modes observed in published studies of NIL deformation over nanometer to millimeter length scales.

40|$|From its beginnings, up to a {{few years}} ago, {{additive}} manufacturing technology was able to produce models or prototypes which have limited use, because of materials mechanical properties. With advancement and invention of new materials, this is changing.

The goal {{of this study was to}} examine opportunities for production of paper <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> by fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3 D printing. This study emphasises the use of environmentally friendly poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials in FDM technology, contrary to the conventional method using metal alloys and acids. Embossing of line elements and letters using 3 D printed <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> was done on six different types of paper. Embossing force was applied using SHIMADZU EZ-LX Compact Tabletop Testing Machine. Each type of paper was repeatedly embossed using different values of embossing force (in 250 N increments, starting at 1000 N) to determine the optimal embossing force for each specific paper type. When determined, the optimal embossing force was used on ten samples for each paper type. Results of embossing were analysed and evaluated. The analysis consisted of investigating the effects of the applied embossing force and characteristics such as paper basis weight, paper structure, surface characteristic and fibre direction of the paper. Results show that paper characteristics determine the embossing force required for achieving a good embossing result. This means that with the right amount of embossing force, letters and borderlines can be equally well formed by the embossing process regardless of paper weight, surface characteristics, etc. <b>Embossing</b> <b>tools</b> produced in this manner can be used in case of the embossing elements that are not complex.

40|$|Ultrasonic hot {{embossing}} is {{an emerging}} technology enabling molding of thermo-plastic polymers in seconds. A stack of polymer foils is heated by the {{friction between the}} foils and protruding microstructures on a tool when ultrasonic vibrations are generated by a sonotrode. The polymer is molten and adapts {{to the shape of}} the microstructures on the tool. Thus, a micro structure is generated in much shorter time than by injection molding or hot embossing. The objective of this work was investigating how tools for ultrasonic hot embossing can be fabricated and what is the influence of the tool on the process. How the embossing energy is distributed in the whole process is briefly discussed in this thesis. When ultrasound is generated, the induced energy is mainly transferred to and absorbed in sonotrode, polymer stack, tool and anvil. At the interfaces, ultrasound is reflected and, this way, re-contributing to heat generation. Ultrasonic energy distribution analyses are based on temperature measurements in the embossing tools and dimension measurements on the embossed polymer micro structures. Embossing tools from aluminum, nickel, steel, polycarbonate (PC) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) were produced and embossed with high density polyethylene (HDPE). The cooling rates of different tools are compared while the energy distributed into embossed polymer and <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> was roughly calculated. Embossing tools with larger acoustic impedance compared to the embossed polymer reflect more ultrasound back to the polymer for melting. Embossing tools with higher heat conduction result in a faster cooling rate after embossing while with less heat capacity and density a higher peak temperature is achieved. The isolation at the interface between <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> and anvil affects the tool temperature and its cooling rate. Consequently, aluminum is more suitable for the sonotrode while nickel and steel are suitable for the tool. Embossing tools from PC and PEEK have shown limited lifetimes for ultrasonic hot embossing and, therefore, are no appropriate alternative. Various ways have been attempted to fabricate ultrasonic hot embossing tools. They are milling, nickel electroplating, lithography and silicon etching. New combinations of these ways were also developed to fabricate a tool with multi-level structures or enlarge the tool size. The operating steps, process parameters, challenges, precautions, advantages and disadvantages of these fabrication ways are discussed and compared. Among them, milling is the most promising way producing embossing tools allowing three-dimensional micro structures, up to more than several hundred micrometers in height and down to 50 µm in width. Besides, nickel electroplating was applicable to produce the tools with structure dimensions of less than 50 µm. The templates for electroplating were prepared by lithography and silicon etching. Liquid metals were also prepared to be employed as <b>embossing</b> <b>tool.</b> Their performance and the reasons of failure are discussed. Several micro devices were developed and fabricated demonstrating the fabrication of tools for ultrasonic hot embossing of three-dimensional micro structures. Design idea, production process and performance are introduced. A Fresnel lens was produced by ultrasonic hot embossing for the first time. Micro nozzles, 150 and 250 µm in diameter, which were used for gas/liquid dispersion, were produced by ultrasonic hot embossing and welding. The nozzle could sustain pressures as high as 29 MPa and 2. 5 MPa at 20 °C and 90 °C, respectively. The multi-phase dispersing ability was also proven. An electronic spiral coil forming a molded interconnect device (MID) was fabricated by ultrasonic hot embossing. The surface of the coil was not flat but bowed and the coil line was distributed along a three-dimensional spiral curve. The calculated and measured resonance frequencies of this coil combined with a capacitor were 1. 6 MHz and 1. 65 MHz, respectively. Several polymer surfaces were embossed with tools fabricated by x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel and milling of aluminum with different structures designs for hydrophobic surfaces. The wettability of the embossed surface was investigated by contact angle measurements. The polymer surface embossed from the x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel tool turned out being more hydrophobic than the one embossed from the aluminum tool. The contact regimes of the embossed surface from the two embossing tools were also theoretically analyzed. The last application was the ultrasonic hot embossing of nano-structures, 600 nm in height, on PC and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly (lactic acid) foils. The challenges and the solutions in ultrasonic hot embossing with this tool are introduced. Finally, the nanostructures were successfully embossed into these polymers...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Distributed feedback, DFB, lasers are a major source for long haul optical fibre based telecommunication systems. They rely on ultrahigh precision gratings to reduce mode competition within the laser cavity, thereby making single frequency operation possible. Techniques applied to DFB grating manufacture tend to be either holographic, or a direct serial write process using slow and expensive electron beam lithographic machines. An entirely new approach is proposed which compliments {{the accuracy of the}} electron beam systems with the high throughput and relatively low cost of a conventional contact mask regime. The new process relies on a group of materials which are able to retain an embossed relief upon curing with ultraviolet radiation. The main manufacturing stages of this new technique are presented including details of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> fabrication using reactive ion etching, and characterisation of material properties. It is proposed that the technique, whilst intended for DFB manufacture, could find applications in many other areas, for instance as a route to low cost replication of photomasks. In addition a new grating assessment technique, based on normal reflectance measurements, has been developed. The technique has been used to investigate hitherto unmeasured effects in electron beam lithography on a variety of substrate materials before and after semiconductor overgrowth. Details of a theoretical exercise which agrees closely with experimental results are included.

40|$|With {{ultrasonic}} hot embossing microstructures can be embossed from a metal tool into semi-finished {{plastic products}} such as films, sheets or filaments. Because usually no vacuum or long heating and cooling processes are necessary, short cycle times of a few seconds can be realized. Significantly more time must be spent on the manually alignment and fixing of the semi-finished products, {{as well as the}} demoulding of the embossed structures by hand. These manual steps have now been replaced by an automated roll-to-roll production process. Both films and filaments with ultrasonic hot embossed microstructures can be produced from roll-to-roll. Up to six films are handled automatically from feed rollers, led to the fixing unit, are ultrasonic hot embossed, demolded and rewound onto another roll. Various microfluidic structures such as channels, heat exchangers or mixers were embossed. Since the embossing result is dependent on the temperature, the temperature curve and its influence on the ultrasonic hot embossing process especially at the short cycle times of the automated production were determined. The temperature of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> was monitored during the entire process. Because of the faster temperature rise very short cycle times {{could not be reached for}} larger structures without affecting the embossing result. Minimum cycle times of 3 - 6 seconds for the tested structures were reached. Plastic filaments can also be micro structured with the automated system. The raw filament, 400 micron in thickness, is unwound from a supply roll, embossed and then wound again onto another roll. The embossed microstructures function as predetermined breaking points. Displaying different load levels the filaments can be used as overload sensors in synthetic fiber ropes. Because in this case the process of ultrasonic hot embossing takes less than one second, the cycle time is mainly affected by the distance between the predetermined breaking points. With a distance of 300 mm between the predetermined breaking points, the manufacturing time for one kilometer sensor is about four hours. In addition to the development of the sensors with predetermined breaking points, the produced sensors were integrated and tested in different synthetic fiber ropes...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis has {{its main}} focus within {{embossing}} operations and how different factors influence the result. The work was performed at Stora Enso Research Centre in Karlstad, Sweden. Embossing is relatively complex operation to analyze since the paperboard can be exposed of both bending, shear and compression {{at the same}} time. The techniques used today for evaluating embossing on paperboard consist of experimental setups. These experimental techniques needed to be complemented {{in order to simplify}} the approach for embossing evaluations. The aim of this thesis was to develop a simulation material model, created with Finite Element Method by using Abaqus (2014), which capture the experimental behavior of embossed paperboard. The goals were to understand which material properties that are of high importance in embossing operations, and how sensitive the simulation material model is at small geometry changes of the <b>embossing</b> <b>tool.</b> A three dimensional finite element material model has been created in Abaqus (2014). The analysis was performed as dynamic quasi-static where an implicit solver was used. The simulation material model consisted of a continuum model, which describes the behavior of the plies, and an interface model implemented as cohesive elements, which describes the inelastic delamination between the plies. The continuum model was defined as an anisotropic linear elastic-plastic material model with isotropic linear hardening together with Hill´s yield criterion. The interface model was defined with an anisotropic elastic-plastic traction-separation law and an exponential damage evolution model. The purpose of the experimental tests was to capture the behavior of embossed paperboard and the goal was then to recreate the behavior in the simulation model. The results in this thesis focus on the relationship between the applied force and the displacement. An experimental and numerical study of out-of-plane compression has also been conducted, where the aim was to determine the out-of-plane elastic modulus, EZD. According to embossing results, the embossing results showed an exponential hardening behavior while the numerical results, unfortunately, showed a declining hardening behavior. Despite this, some understanding regarding which parameters that are of utmost importance have been achieved. The material parameters which had the highest influence on embossed paperboards seem to be the out-of-plane shear properties. This thesis also shows that the material model is sensitive of small changes of the tool geometry. The proportion of shear, bending and compression are strongly dependent on if the tool has sharp edges or if the edges are more rounded...|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of thermal NIL {{presented}} here, holes are pre-patterned in a triangular array {{on the surface of}} a thin aluminium layer deposited on a P+ conductive Si wafer. As described in Figure  1 c, a thermoplastic resin (NEB 22 from Sumitomo Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) is coated on an aluminium layer. A silicon mould, treated with an anti-sticking layer [31] and presenting a triangular array of pits, is then pressed on the sample in an EVG 520 hot <b>embossing</b> <b>tool</b> (EV Group, St. Florian an Inn, Austria) at 0.2 kN.cm− 2 and 125 °C. Mould patterns are reproduced in the polymer since the applied temperature is higher than the resin's glass transition temperature. After removal from the mould at room temperature, the pattern is transferred into the surface of the Al layer using a conventional plasma dry etching technique. In a Centura 5200 reactive ion etching chamber (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a Cl 2 /Ar/O 2 plasma is used to remove the residual resin layer and a Cl 2 /BCl 3 plasma is used for etching the Al surface. The final structure consists of a 2 × 2 -cm 2 surface of aluminium structured with holes of few nanometres depth in a triangular array of different periods according to the initial mould design. During the anodization, these holes will act as surface defects, initiating the pore growth as described in Figure  1 a. The layer is so directly anodized at the voltage corresponding to the period given by the NIL and according to Equation 1. Samples are anodized in a home-made cell under a constant voltage, in an orthophosphoric or oxalic acid bath at constant temperature (T = 8 °C). The electrolyte is stirred during the process of anodization to facilitate the flow of the species in the electrolyte and to remove the bubbles of H 2 gas from the platinum electrode. A Parstat 2273 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) is used to apply a constant voltage and to follow the I-V curve in situ between a platinum circular electrode and the sample. In order to obtain defect-free triangular arrays of pores, the voltage has to be adjusted so that the natural period of the porous alumina corresponds to the NIL-fabricated guiding pattern. The anodizing time does not differ significantly from the classical anodization time of a simple anodization: with 3 % oxalic acid under 40 V at 8 °C, simple anodization of 1 μm of Al takes 1, 750 s and anodization after nanoimprint lasts 1, 700 s. Furthermore, under these experimental conditions, the ratio between the thickness of Al layer deposited and the final thickness of highly organised alumina is evaluated at 1.25. Figure  1 b shows an array of 2 × 2 cm 2 of highly organised porous alumina.|$|E

40|$|In the {{production}} of micro-scaled products and products with micro and nano scaled surface functionalities, laser ablation becomes a more and more important tool which is able to generate structure sizes {{in the range of}} 10 - 100 m and with new machining strategies even in range smaller than one micrometer. One crucial task for all laser machining applications is the realisation of a high surface quality with a minimum of roughness and with no thermal effect on the geometry of the part. Using ultra short pulsed lasers with pulse durations of 10 ps in pulse bursts of several pulses with a time spacing of 20 ns each and adapted pulse energies, the surface quality of metal micro ablation have been increased significantly. Compared to single pulse ablation, the roughness has been decreased by a factor of 2 {{and at the same time}} the ablation efficiency has been increased up to a factor of 4. This technology has been adapted to {{the production}} of micro moulding tools as well as for the manufacturing of functional surfaces with improved wetting capabilities and for other micro parts such as micron sized filters and <b>embossing</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of micro parts {{is mainly}} done in silicon, where manufacturing technologies from electronic production can be used. In cases, where the mechanical and structural properties of silicon {{are not sufficient}} or the costs of silicon micro parts can not be effort, other materials like polymers and metals have to be used. In this cases laser technologies can be a versatile tool {{for the production of}} tools, like moulds and stamping and <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> or the micro parts directly. Short pulse lasers, especially frequency-tripled, diode pumped Nd:YAG-lasers with a high beam quality offer the possibility to ablate these materials with high quality. With a spot size of about 10 µm, high fluences (> 100 J/cm 2) can be achieved, so that the materials are vaporised without or with only a small amount of molten material. This technique is applicable for the production of micro tools with accuracies < 10 µm at three dimensional microstructures. With optimised machining parameters the surface roughness can be reduced to Ra <= 0. 1 µm [...] Depending on the material and the machining parameters the slicing thickness is in the range of 1 to 10 µm...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of silicon tools and an appropriate hot embossing technology for polymers. With this technology, high quality embossing of optical or fluidic structure for high precision requirements in a batch process is possible thereby reducing system costs. Possible usage is the production of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) for optical or fluidic applications. This could be sensors for chemical analysis of liquids or BioMEMS. Further promising applications are multifunctional printed circuit boards (PCB) or micro cooler. Up to now for coarser dimensions the use of conventional made (e. g. miling) steel tools is common. For forming of smallest structures down to the sub-micrometer range with excellent surface roughness LIGA technology is applied. However, {{in order to reduce the}} system costs LIGA tools shall be substituted by silicon tools. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) is used to fabricate such an <b>embossing</b> <b>tools</b> allowing complex geometrical figures. For fluidics or optical applications the tool structures have to show a tapered (positive) profile and sufficient low roughness. Roughness can be minimised by further oxidation and etch steps. The hot embossing experiments which will be presented show the capability of the optimised DRIE technology for the aimed application field...|$|R

40|$|Small lung {{carcinoma}} is an {{endemic disease}} {{throughout the world}} which occurs mainly by cigarette smoking. A mutagenous compound known as nitro benzene is formed in the body due to cigarette smoking which causes mutation in normal tissues of lung and hence they are changed into malignant tissues by over growth of the tissues. Cancer Genome Anatomy Project website developed by National Cancer Institute contains all the genomic data and different tools having different data sets. CGAP gives a chance to analyze all the wet lab data computationally and hence, CGAP was {{used to analyze the}} cause of small lung carcinoma. For this SAGE GENIE TOOL was used to get the SAGE tags as less expressed and over expressed in normal and malignant tissues. VIRTUAL NORTHERN BLOT TOOL was used to justify the result of SAGE GENIE by visualizing the strength of blot and mediator complex 20 was obtained as the mutant m-RNA product. GO and SEQUENCE TAG VIEWER TOOL were used to get the relevant information of the MED- 20 tag and to retrieve the nucleotide sequence of the MED- 20. Finally pairwise alignment was done in between normal nucleotide sequence of chromosome 6 and mutant MED- 20 tag by <b>EMBOSS</b> <b>TOOL</b> and was identified, as a single nucleotide mutation at guanine.
