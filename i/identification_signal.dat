5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames {{was an old}} frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, which meant that the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns and weighing almost double the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an <b>identification</b> <b>signal</b> and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes did not respond to the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the previously mentioned navigational signals, the localizer provides for ILS facility identification by periodically transmitting a 1,020 Hz Morse code <b>identification</b> <b>signal.</b> For example, the ILS for runway 4R at John F. Kennedy International Airport transmits IJFK to identify itself, while runway 4L is known as IHIQ. This lets users know the facility is operating normally {{and that they are}} tuned to the correct ILS. The glide slope station transmits no <b>identification</b> <b>signal,</b> so ILS equipment relies on the localizer for identification.|$|E

50|$|The SCR-277 {{was used}} as a {{navigation}} aid. It included the BC-467 transmitter with an RF output power of 800 watts, the BC-468 Goniometer, and BC-342 receiver. Frequencies utilized were 200-400 KHz for transmission and 1.5-18 MHz for reception. Radio range homing equipment transmitted tone <b>identification</b> <b>signals</b> to aircraft that lacked a radio compass but were equipped with command sets. Range was approximately 300 miles. It was powered by a single PE-90 generator.|$|R
5000|$|As the Germans had {{received}} intelligence regarding the <b>identification</b> <b>signals</b> needed {{to enter the}} harbour, they were initially able to land unopposed.

This technique determines the {{location of}} the handset by putting its location by cell <b>identification,</b> <b>signal</b> strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with GPS then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier.|$|E
40|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>identification</b> is an {{umbrella}} term for signal processing techniques {{designed for the}} identification of the transmission parameters of unknown or partially known communication signals. Initially a key technology for military applications such as signal interception, radio surveillance and electronic warfare, <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> techniques recently found applications in commercial wireless communications as an enabling technology for cognitive receivers. With the advance and rapid adoption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems in the last decade, extension of <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> methods to include this transmission paradigm has become a priority and focus of intensive research efforts. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on algorithms proposed for the new and challenging <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> problems specific to MIMO systems, including space-time block code (STBC) identification, MIMO modulation identification, and detection of the number of transmit antennas. Finally, concluding remarks on MIMO <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> are provided along with an outline of the open problems and future research directions. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
30|$|HBC is very {{suitable}} for providing a context awareness service based on TAP. After devices are connected by touch, <b>identification</b> <b>signals</b> are transmitted through user's body, {{and the type}} of devices is recognized by each other. For example, when a user touches an advertisement device with one hand while holding a PDA in the other hand, the touch is detected by the advertisement device and the device sends advertisement contents. Finally, the information can be downloaded into the PDA via user's body.|$|R
40|$|The {{time-varying}} {{characteristics of}} non-linear systems responding to typical <b>identification</b> <b>signals</b> are addressed {{and the potential}} for identifying some time-varying patterns is shown. Specifically, the instantaneous frequency of system responses is analysed, and shown to characterise non-linear behaviour. The analysis is done via the Hilbert transform. Examples include a Duffing oscillator and a memoryless system of the type y=x 3. The possibility of enhancing the time–frequency resolution, as compared to classic Fourier methods, is also briefly addressed. � 1997 Academic Press Limited 1...|$|R
50|$|IFF/SIF (Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature) system {{compliant}} with STANAG 4579. Located {{on the main}} gun mantlet, just above the gun, the system fires a 38 GHz beam {{in the direction of}} the gun for a response from the targeted vehicle. If a proper response signal is shown by the target, the fire control system automatically identifies it as a friendly. If the target fails to respond to the <b>identification</b> <b>signal,</b> it is then declared as a hostile.|$|E
5000|$|This metric {{looks at}} the number of people {{entering}} a store who had visited the store previously. WiFi counting has the ability to remember the Unique WiFi signal ID emitted by shoppers, allowing the system to detect if a shopper has previously visited the store.

50|$|Obvious jamming is easy {{to detect}} {{because it can be}} heard on the {{receiving}} equipment. It usually is some type of noise such as stepped tones (bagpipes), random-keyed code, pulses, music (often distorted), erratically warbling tones, highly distorted speech, random noise (hiss) and recorded sounds. Various combinations of these methods may be used often accompanied by regular morse <b>identification</b> <b>signal</b> to enable individual transmitters to be identified in order to assess their effectiveness. For example, China, which used jamming extensively and still does, plays a loop of traditional Chinese music while it is jamming channels (c.f. Attempted jamming of numbers stations).|$|E

30|$|In Section 3, we have {{reviewed}} the watermark-based detector proposed in [4, 5]. We have shown that the detector fails at properly handling attacks carried out by cyber-physical adversaries. In particular, we have shown that an adversary that learns about the system model is able to separate the watermark from the control signal and able to succeed at attacking the system without being detected. Then, we have presented an enhanced detection scheme. The main idea of the new scheme is to use multiple watermark distributions and non-stationary <b>identification</b> <b>signals.</b> The resulting approach is able to detect both cyber- and cyber-physical adversaries.|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of small}} crafts/targets, in particular, sailing yachts with the ship's radar {{is not always}} possible. Radar reflectors are used to improve their detection. The AIS (Automatic Identification System) transmits position, motion vector and <b>identification</b> <b>signals</b> of a vessel to other ships and VTS (Vessel Traffic Services) centers. This system {{significantly}} increases the possibility to detect small crafts. The paper presents results of comparative study of using information from the Automatic Identification System and from radar to determine the accuracy of tracking the position and motion vector of ships in the Gulf of Gdansk. Possibilities and limitations of the AIS are also presented...|$|R

5000|$|A {{next-generation}} United States Navy strike {{vessel that}} appeared in the episode [...] "Terror in New York City". Commissioned in January 2064 and built in the same year, it has a top speed of 200 kn, which Virgil described as [...] "phenomenal" [...] when he detected it. The warship is 720 feet long, has a beam of 98 feet, and a displacement of 51,270 tons. Unfortunately, the Sentinel also detected Thunderbird 2 and launched a missile attack, having erroneously identified Thunderbird 2 as an enemy aircraft since it was too slow to be a missile, too fast to be a civilian aircraft and did not match any U.S. military aircraft. Although the Sentinel was prevented from fully destroying Thunderbird 2 when an <b>identification</b> <b>signal</b> was transmitted at the last minute, the damage sustained to the ship's engines crippled {{it for the rest of}} the episode. Subsequently, the Sentinel helped International Rescue to save some reporters from drowning in an underwater river in New York by taking Thunderbird 4 aboard and carrying it near the city, as Sentinel was the only available craft capable of transporting Thunderbird 4 that was fast enough to take it to the city in time to make a difference.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to this reported threat, Col. Tillman said he flew Air Force One over the Gulf of Mexico to test whether the other aircraft would follow. The other jet continued on its route, and Tillman {{said that it was}} later explained to him that an airliner had lost its transponder and that the pilots on-board neglected to switch to another radio frequency. An aircraft transponder broadcasts an electronic <b>identification</b> <b>signal.</b> [...] A threat came again when Tillman received a message warning of an imminent attack on Air Force One. [...] "We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next.' Angel being the classified call sign for Air Force One. Once we got into the Gulf Mexico and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, {{it would be good to}} have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us." [...] At this point, Tillman said that the plan to fly the president back to Washington, DC was aborted and instead Tillman landed at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana and Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, where the president made a speech. Tillman explained that this was due to his concern that because of the reported threat, Air Force One would be attacked when he returned to Andrews Air Force Base.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for statistical association <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> is developed in this paper. We consider {{a strategy for}} nonprecise <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> by extending the well-known signal detection and <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> methods applicable to the multiple testing problem. Collection of statistical instruments under the presented approach is much broader than under the traditional <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> methods, allowing more efficient signal discovery. Further assessments of maximal value and average statistics in signal discovery are improved. While our method does not attempt to detect individual predictors, it instead detects sets of predictors that are jointly associated with the outcome. Therefore, an important application would be in genome wide association study (GWAS), {{where it can be}} used to detect genes which influence the phenotype but do not contain any individually significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We compare power of the <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> method based on extremes of single p-values with the signal localization method based on average statistics for logarithms of p-values. A simulation analysis informs the application of signal localization using the average statistics for wide signals discovery in Gaussian white noise process.
