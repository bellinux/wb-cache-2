5000|$|In {{standard}} English, the phonetic {{realization of}} the dental fricative phonemes shows less variation than for many other English consonants. Both are pronounced either interdentally, with the blade of the tongue resting against {{the lower part of}} the back of the upper teeth and the tip protruding slightly or alternatively with the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper teeth. The interdental position might also be described as [...] "apico-" [...] or [...] "lamino-dental". These two positions may be free variants, but for some speakers they are complementary allophones, the position behind the teeth being used when the dental fricative stands in proximity to an alveolar fricative, as in clothes (...) or myths (...) [...] Lip configuration may vary depending on phonetic context. The vocal folds are abducted. The velopharyngeal port is closed. Air forced between tongue surface and cutting edge of the upper teeth (interdental) or inside surface of the teeth (dental) creates audible <b>frictional</b> <b>turbulence.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{array of}} 76 {{high-resolution}} temperature sensors at 0. 5 m intervals between 5 and 42. 5 m {{off the bottom}} was moored near the Barcelona harbor buoy in 81 m water depth, between October 2013 and April 2014. The mooring was located just seaward of an extensive sediment wave area developed in the Llobregat River prodelta, with 1 m high crests parallel to the coast and 50 – 100 m wavelengths. In the NW-Mediterranean, the thermal stratification reaches its maximum penetration through the water column in autumn until it is broken by winter convection. Such a deep stratification affects large-scale sub-inertial slope currents, which are mostly confined to {{the upper half of}} the water column, by the hampered vertical exchange of <b>frictional</b> <b>turbulence,</b> and supports near-bottom internal waves between the inertial and buoyancy frequencies. Observed onshelf propagating frontal bores most likely interact with the sediment waves and contribute to their generation, as they are trailed by considerable shear-induced turbulence and high-frequency internal waves close to the buoyancy frequency that have wavelengths matching those of the sediment waves. The bores are either driven by near-inertial or 3 – 7 day periodic sub-inertial motions just following a brief period of large convective instability {{at the end of the}} offshelf flow phase...|$|E
40|$|Two parameterizations of {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} processes at the interface between an ice shelf and the ocean beneath are investigated {{in terms of their}} impact on simulated melt rates and feedbacks. The parameterizations differ in the transfer coefficients for heat and freshwater fluxes. In their simplest form, they are assumed constant and hence are independent of the velocity of ocean currents at the ice shelf base. An augmented melt rate parameterization accounts for <b>frictional</b> <b>turbulence</b> via transfer coefficients that do depend on boundary layer current velocities via a drag law. In simulations with both parameterizations for idealized as well as realistic cavity geometries under Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, significant differences in melt rate patterns between the velocity-independent and velocity-dependent formulations are found. While patterns are strongly correlated to those of thermal forcing for velocity-independent transfer coefficients, melting in the case of velocity-dependent coefficients is collocated with regions of high boundary layer currents, in particular where rapid plume outflow occurs. Both positive and negative feedbacks between melt rates, boundary layer temperature, velocities, and buoyancy fluxes are identified. Melt rates are found to increase with increasing drag coefficient inline image, in agreement with plume model simulations, but optimal values of Cd inferred from plume models are not easily transferable. Uncertainties therefore remain, both regarding simulated melt rate spatial distributions and magnitudes...|$|E

40|$|Bed {{features}} have {{an important}} effect on <b>frictional</b> characteristics and <b>turbulence</b> in the flow and have a direct effect on sediment transport. Observations of hydrodynamics and bedform evolution are presented at 2 locations in the Dee estuary. Hydrodynamics and turbulence are controlled by tides which {{have a range of}} about 10 m. Some wave events were mainly recorded at the western location because of higher exposure to western waves. In the Hilbre channel (STABLEIII tripod), the bed evolution is dominated by scour under the frame and ripple formation is not evident. This could also be attributed to the high concentration of cohesive material and large tidal velocities. In the Welsh channel, velocities were lower and no evidence of a scour was found...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} effect of wind on a microphone, wind screens are used, usually made of foam or cloth. Although this measure to reduce wind noise is well known and widely used, it lacks a {{theoretical}} explanation. One possible explanation was the turbulent wake in the air flow behind the wind screen, another the pressure variations due to turbulence inherent in outdoor wind. In the present paper it is shown that atmospheric turbulence is indeed the cause of outdoor microphone wind noise, and the knowledge that is available in atmospheric boundary layer physics {{can be used to}} model the effects of atmospheric turbulence on a bare or screened microphone. A wind screen {{can be seen as a}} first order low pass filter for pressure variations due to atmospheric turbulence. Induced wind noise is thus determined by (average) wind speed and wind screen diameter, but also by factors related to <b>frictional</b> and thermal <b>turbulence</b> (roughness length and atmospheric stability). This approach leads to predicted spectral values of the induced "sound" pressure that match experimental data. The result can be used to obtain proper outdoor ambient wind related sound levels by correcting measured sound levels with calculated wind-induced pressure levels.

40|$|Observations {{show that}} {{geomagnetic}} field lines follow closely the atmospheric circulation patterns and that geomagnetic field variations are precursors to climate change. The exact {{mechanism for the}} observed close relationship between global geomagnetic field and the tropospheric weather patterns is not clear. In this paper a universal theory of atmospheric eddy dynamics is presented which shows that the global geomagnetic field, atmospheric electric field and weather systems are manifestations of a semi permanent scale invariant hierarchical atmospheric eddy continuum. Quantitative equations are derived {{to show that the}} full continuum of atmospheric eddies exist as a unified whole and originate from buoyant energy supply from <b>frictional</b> <b>turbulence</b> at the planetary surface. Large eddy growth occurs from turbulence scale by the universal period doubling route to chaos. The turbulent eddies are carried upwards on the large eddy envelopes and vertical mixing occurs by the turbulent eddy fluctuations resulting in downward transport of negative space charges from higher levels and simultaneous upward transport of positive space charges from surface levels. The eddy circulations therefore generate a large-scale vertical aerosol current, which is of the correct sign and magnitude to generate the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. Therefore, atmospheric circulation patterns leave signature on the geomagnetic field lines whose global variations can be easily monitored by satellite borne sensors and thus assist in weather and climate prediction.

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} ocean {{circulation}} in sub-ice shelf cavities and the overlying ice shelf have received considerable {{attention in the}} context of observed changes in flow speeds of marine ice sheets around Antarctica. Modeling these interactions requires parameterizing the turbulent boundary layer processes to infer melt rates from the oceanic state at the ice-ocean interface. Here we explore two such parameterizations {{in the context of}} the MIT ocean general circulation model coupled to the z-coordinates ice shelf cavity model of Losch (2008). We investigate both idealized ice shelf cavity geometries as well as a realistic cavity under Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS), West Antarctica. Our starting point is a three-equation melt rate parameterization implemented by Losch (2008), which is based on the work of Hellmer and Olbers (1989). In this form, the transfer coefficients for calculating heat and freshwater fluxes are independent of <b>frictional</b> <b>turbulence</b> induced by the proximity of the moving ocean to the fixed ice interface. More recently, Holland and Jenkins (1999) have proposed a parameterization in which the transfer coefficients do depend on the ocean-induced turbulence and are directly coupled to the speed of currents in the ocean mixed layer underneath the ice shelf through a quadratic drag formulation and a bulk drag coefficient. The melt rate parameterization in the MITgcm is augmented to account for this velocity dependence. First, the effect of the augmented formulation is investigated in terms of its impact on melt rates as well as on its feedback on the wider sub-ice shelf circulation. We find that, over a wide range of drag coefficients, velocity-dependent melt rates are more strongly constrained by the distribution of mixed layer currents than by the temperature gradient between the shelf base and underlying ocean, as opposed to velocity-independent melt rates. This leads to large differences in melt rate patterns under PIIS when including versus not including the velocity dependence. In a second time, the modulating effects of tidal currents on melting at the base of PIIS are examined. We find that the temporal variability of velocity-dependent melt rates under tidal forcing is greater than that of velocity-independent melt rates. Our experiments suggest that because tidal currents under PIIS are weak and buoyancy fluxes are strong, tidal mixing is negligible and tidal rectification is restricted to very steep bathymetric features, such as the ice shelf front. Nonetheless, strong tidally-rectified currents at the ice shelf front significantly increase ablation rates there when the formulation of the transfer coefficients includes the velocity dependence. The enhanced melting then feedbacks positively on the rectified currents, which are susceptible to insulate the cavity interior from changes in open ocean conditions. by Véronique Dansereau.
