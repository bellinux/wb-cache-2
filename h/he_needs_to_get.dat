25|$|After {{several months}} {{of living in the}} dojo, Kenshin discovers that his {{successor}} as assassin of the shadows, Shishio Makoto, plans to conquer Japan by destroying the Meiji Government, starting with Kyoto. Feeling that his friends may be attacked by Shishio's faction, Kenshin goes to meet Shishio alone in order to defeat him.

After his first meeting with him, Kenshin realizes <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stronger to defeat Shishio without becoming the cold assassin he was in the past and returns to the man who taught him kenjutsu, Hiko Seijūrō, in order to learn the school's final technique. He finally accepts his friends' help and defeats Shishio in a close fight; Shishio dies being engulfed in flames due to the rise in his body temperature caused by his severe burns.|$|E

Each time {{he gets a}} job however, he uses bubble blowing, resulting in him getting fired. Back in Bikini Bottom, after Squidward (who hates SpongeBob enough to want him gone for good) destroys a device that Sandy made to find SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs orders him to look for SpongeBob.

500|$|The subplot of [...] "The Mansion Family", where Mr. Burns gets {{a medical}} examination, was {{inspired}} by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic. George Meyer, an executive producer on the series, has said that [...] "John, I don't think {{is a guy who}} goes to the doctor very often. And every 20 or 30 years, he decides <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had them give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [...] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him." [...] While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. Rick Lazio, a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters. [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E
500|$|As the 2007 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team {{prepared for the}} 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Graham got some unusual news off the field {{when he found out}} that he had been given a perfect 99 rating in the NCAA 2008 EA Sports even though his star teammates Chad Henne, Jake Long and Mike Hart had not. [...] Also, off the field, Graham was issued a ticket playing loud music in a vehicle on July 24 and missed the September 18 court date after pleading not guilty. [...] This caused a judge to issue an arrest warrant for failing to appear in court on a disorderly conduct charge. The charges were dropped under the belief that he had been misidentified. At the start of training camp, he weighed [...] and was the projected starter at defensive end. Although projected to as the starter, Graham played sparingly in the opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champions Appalachian State Mountaineers on September 1. [...] Head coach Lloyd Carr noted his disfavor with Graham {{at the start of the}} season: [...] "Brandon, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> focused," [...] Carr said, [...] "and do the things that he's capable of doing." [...] He was disappointed in Graham's efforts in practice. In the third game, on September 15 against Notre Dame Graham recorded 3.5 sacks in the rivalry game to help lead Michigan to its first win of the season. [...] The following week, he had 1.5 sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery in a victory against Penn State. [...] Over the course of the season, he started six games at defensive end. [...] He led the team in sacks with 8.5 and was second in forced fumbles with 3. [...] He ranked seventh in the Big Ten for both statistics. [...] He was a mid-season Ted Hendricks Award watch list candidate.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "Watching High Fidelity, I had the feeling I could {{walk out of the}} theater and meet the same people on the street [...] and want to, which is an even higher compliment." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as [...] "a bundle of {{verbally}} ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he's in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Cusack's performance, writing that he was [...] "a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of them." [...] USA Today did not give the film a positive review: [...] "Let's be kind and just say High Fidelity doesn't quite belong beside Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sure Thing in Cusack's greatest hits collection. It's not that he isn't good. More like miscast." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "In High Fidelity, Rob's music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture." ...|$|E
60|$|Along {{during the}} morning I {{borrowed}} a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack {{and put them in}} it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with, Tom said; it's his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners {{it would be a very}} different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we NEEDED. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.|$|E

Massingham gave him the introduction <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it published, in 1944.|$|R
50|$|Weisskopf {{was born}} in Vienna to Jewish parents and earned his {{doctorate}} in physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1931.
