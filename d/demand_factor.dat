50|$|In telecommunication, {{electronics}} and the electrical power industry, the term <b>demand</b> <b>factor</b> {{is used to}} refer to the fractional amount of some quantity being used relative to the maximum amount that could be used by the same system. The <b>demand</b> <b>factor</b> is always {{less than or equal to}} one. As the amount of demand is a time dependent quantity so is the <b>demand</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{difference}} to note {{is that the}} denominator in the <b>demand</b> <b>factor</b> is fixed depending on the system. Because of this, the <b>demand</b> <b>factor</b> cannot be derived from the load profile but needs {{the addition of the}} full load of the system in question.|$|E

The study reviews the current sugar policies with an aim of formulating better solutions to help protecting farmers and the local industries. In addressing the problems facing the sugar industry in Kenya, the study also evaluates the roles played by various sugar stakeholders in Kenya, their effectiveness, and impacts to the general performance of this vital industry. This study also investigated the sugar supply and <b>demand</b> <b>factors</b> resulting in low sugarcane price at the farm level using a price transmission model (Kinnucan 1987).

The measured <b>demand</b> <b>factors</b> differ from those often estimated during energy surveys. Duty factors for some equipment were found to exceed 100 %, showing that some loads were on for longer periods than that indicated by plant personnel. Comparing a detailed summary of equipment rated loads to annual utility bills, when measurements are not available, can prevent over-estimation of the <b>demand</b> and duty <b>factors</b> for a plant. Raw unadjusted estimates of <b>demand</b> <b>factors</b> of 60 % or higher are often made, yet comparisons of rated loads to utility bills show that some equipment <b>demand</b> <b>factors</b> may be 50 % or less. This project tested a simple beacon alerting system, which used a blue strobe light to alert plant personnel when a preset demand limit had been reached.
