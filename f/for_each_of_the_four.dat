5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, one <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

25|$|John Madden was {{the first}} person to have {{announced}} a Super Bowl <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> major U.S. television networks, having called five Super Bowls for CBS, three for Fox, and two for ABC prior to joining NBC in 2006.

Also, Michaels (who, like Madden, had moved from ABC to NBC in 2006) was the second person to serve as a Super Bowl play-by-play announcer for two major U.S. television networks (following Pat Summerall of CBS and Fox). This would prove to be the final game Madden would call, as he announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 16, 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} {{have been subject to}} criticism, both in the media and in formal proceedings before the Braidwood Commission of Inquiry. The officers were served notices of misconduct by the commission forewarning them the commissioner may include a finding of misconduct in its final report. The warnings allege specific but overlapping grounds <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four.</b> The collective allegations are that they failed to properly assess and respond to the circumstances in which they found Mr. Dziekański. They repeatedly deployed the taser without justification and separately failed to adequately reassess the situation before further deploying it. The notices allege that afterwards they misrepresented facts in notes and statements, furthered the misrepresenting before the commission and provided further misleading information about other evidence before the commission. The four officers each sought judicial review to prevent the commission from making findings based on the notices. The petitions were dismissed. Three of the officers appealed and lost. In July 2013 one of the three officers was cleared of perjury. The remaining two officers stood trial in 2014.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 study, Desai et al. {{focussed}} {{on education}} attainments {{of children and}} young adults aged 6–29, from lowest caste and tribal populations of India. They completed a national survey of over 100,000 households <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> survey years between 1983 and 2000. They found a significant increase in lower caste children in their odds of completing primary school. The number of dalit children who completed either middle-, high- or college-level education increased three times faster than the national average, and the total number were statistically same for both lower and upper castes. However, the same study found that in 2000, the percentage of dalit males never enrolled in a school was still more than twice the percentage of upper caste males never enrolled in schools. Moreover, only 1.67% of dalit females were college graduates compared to 9.09% of upper caste females. The number of dalit girls in India who attended school doubled in the same period, but still few percent less than national average. Other poor caste groups as well as ethnic groups such as Muslims in India have also made improvements over the 16-year period, but their improvement lagged behind that of dalits and adivasis. The net percentage school attainment for Dalits and Muslims were statistically the same in 1999.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{beneficiaries}} of the property tax are county boards of education. Property taxes are paid to the sheriff {{of each of the}} state's 55 counties. Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. However, the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies. The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties. Property is assessed according to its use, location and value as of July 1. All property is reappraised every three years; annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value. West Virginia does not impose an inheritance tax. Because of the phase-out of the federal estate tax credit, West Virginia's estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1, 2005.|$|E

[...] Twenty-three designs were submitted by May 1, which was later narrowed down to four finalists: Austin Hays, Charles Henry Niehaus, Attilio Piccirilli and Thomas Waldo Story. [...] The four sculptors were later asked to submit larger models for further review by the advisory committee. [...] The model submitted by Story was favored by McClellan's widow, Nelly. [...] In 1903, the committee rejected three of the designs, citing a lack of individuality and symbolism. [...] The fourth design, by Niehaus, was reluctantly approved by the committee, though the commission rejected all of the designs stating [...] "no model submitted upon the competition is satisfactory." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Chicago Bears {{head coach}} Heartley [...] "Hunk" [...] Anderson gave a highly {{critical}} {{account of his}} interactions with Shaughnessy in Notre Dame, Chicago Bears, and Hunk Anderson.

Anderson, thinking he noticed a vulnerability to exploit, asked which end run and which blocking assignments to use. Shaughnessy replied that any end run would do. Anderson asked in disgust for Shaughnessy to sit down and watch the rest of the game. He explained that the Bears had 28 different end runs to each side <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> backs, each of which had numerous blocking schemes. He added, [...] "You just can't say 'any end run'...You have to choose one."
