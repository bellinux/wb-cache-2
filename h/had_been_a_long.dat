5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E

Locomotive No.3 operates {{on a regular}} basis at the Pacific Locomotive Association's Niles Canyon Railway. This is a 2-6-2T (Tank) engine built by the American Locomotive Company in 1927.|$|E

Though it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and costly series of campaigns, it proved {{to be one of the}} most successful of Pitt's policies. While a modest French presence remained in Illinois and Louisiana the fighting served to end any significant French military threats in North America for good.|$|E

25|$|After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{period with}} {{relatively}} few direct armed conflicts involving the military {{forces of the}} two neighbours – notwithstanding the efforts of both nations to control the Siachen Glacier by establishing military outposts on the surrounding mountains ridges and the resulting military skirmishes in the 1980s. During the 1990s, however, escalating tensions and conflict due to separatist activities in Kashmir, {{some of which were}} supported by Pakistan, as well as the conducting of nuclear tests by both countries in 1998, led to an increasingly belligerent atmosphere. In an attempt to defuse the situation, both countries signed the Lahore Declaration in February 1999, promising to provide a peaceful and bilateral solution to the Kashmir conflict.|$|E
500|$|A {{political}} international is an organisation {{of political}} parties or activists {{with the aim of}} co-ordinating their activity for a common purpose.

500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E

500|$|Gilligan {{inserted}} {{a reference to}} the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms" [...] in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|Rumours of a co-headlining tour from Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars first {{circulated}} on March 3, 2014, when a Texas {{radio station}} {{revealed that the}} two [...] "modern rock icons" [...] would be partaking in a tour starting in late summer and that a performance in The Woodlands would take place on September 5. The tour was officially announced the following day, on March 4, 2014 {{at a press conference}} held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California with Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington from Linkin Park, and Jared Leto from Thirty Seconds to Mars. The conference was broadcast on the internet through the interactive social platform VyRT. In an interview with Billboard, Bennington explained that a co-headlining tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time coming; Linkin Park, indeed, had polled their fans a number of times in order to identify which artist they would like to join them on tour and Thirty Seconds to Mars was the most sought-after band multiple times. Thirty Seconds to Mars first worked with Linkin Park in 2007, opening some European shows for the band.|$|E

2500|$|Established in 1918, the EUS {{has always}} placed a large {{emphasis}} on furthering traditions {{much like a}} fraternity. Unlike a fraternity the EUS membership was never gender specific. These traditions primarily involve socializing, drinking and ritual. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> held view that these behaviours were tolerated and encouraged by the Engineering Faculty and engineering profession as they imbue engineering students {{with a sense of}} identity as engineers and that this identity leads to a more cohesive professional body. [...] Many of these traditions were identified as being sexist [...] and {{in the last two decades}} have gradually been eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|There <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> trading {{relationship}} between the Venetians and the Byzantines before, starting with the Byzantine–Venetian Treaty of 1082. However, with the chaotic events of 1204, the {{relationship between}} the two powers had greatly changed. In order to undercut the Venetian military support from the Latin Empire, the major inheritor of Constantinople, Theodore Lascaris, signed a trade agreement with Venice in August 1219 that provided freedom of trade and duty-free imports to the Venetians throughout the Nicaean Empire. In addition to the trading rights, the Doge of Venice, Pietro Ziani, was given the title of Despot and [...] "Dominator of the quarter and the half-quarter of the Roman imperium".|$|E
2500|$|Estienne's plan {{met with}} {{approbation}} from Commander-in-chief Joffre, who on 7 January 1916 proposed {{the production of}} an [...] "offensive engine" [...] to Minister of Armaments Albert Thomas. On the 18th Estienne was received by Joffre personally to clarify his ideas. In {{a letter to the}} ministry dated 31 January 1916 Joffre desired the production of four hundred tanks of the type suggested by Estienne. Although there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> prior development phase with the Schneider company, Estienne's decisive role in getting the Schneider vehicle produced in mass has earned him a traditional position in history as the creator of the first French tank. [...] This is put into perspective by his limited involvement in its technical design; [...] as early as January 1916 the actual completion was entrusted to a ministerial bureau headed by General Léon Augustin Jean Marie Mourret, director of the Army automobile service. Mourret did not closely cooperate with Estienne, who was essentially excluded from decisions of a technical nature.|$|E

2500|$|The Expos {{finished}} 1991 with a 71–90 record, {{sixth in}} the NL East, and drew fewer than one million fans {{for the first time}} since 1976. However, the foundation of the Expos' future was establishing their places in MLB: [...] Larry Walker, Marquis Grissom and Delino DeShields had made their debuts the season prior, and the team acquired Moisés Alou in a trade with Pittsburgh. Moises' father Felipe, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time employee of the Expos, was promoted to manager during the [...] season and became the first native of the Dominican Republic to manage a Major League Baseball team. In , DeShields was sent to Los Angeles in exchange for Pedro Martínez; the deal was initially pilloried by the Montreal Gazette and other local publications as a move designed to save money rather than improve the ball club. [...] Nonetheless, the Expos improved on the field; they won 87 games in 1992, 94 in 1993 and finished second in the NL East both seasons.|$|E
2500|$|Although Song Yingxing's {{encyclopedia}} was {{a significant}} publication for his age, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> tradition {{in the history of}} Chinese literature in creating large encyclopedic works. For example, the Four Great Books of Song compiled much earlier in the 10th and 11th centuries (and all four combined, were much more extensive in size than his work). Just a few decades before Yingxing's work, there was also the Ming Dynasty encyclopedia of the Sancai Tuhui, written in 1607 and published in 1609. Song Yingxing's famous work was the Tiangong Kaiwu, or The Exploitation of the Works of Nature, published in May 1637 with funding provided by Song's patron Tu Shaokui. [...] The Tiangong Kaiwu is an encyclopedia covering a wide range of technical issues, including the use of various gunpowder weapons. Copies of the book were very scarce in China during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) (due to the government's establishment of monopolies over certain industries described in the book), but original copies of the book were preserved in Japan.|$|E

A lot of hard work disappeared in an instant." [...] Frijns said he was delighted to finish in a points-scoring position but felt the event was [...] "one of the more bizarre races of my career" [...] and believed luck was beside him. He stated it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time since he had scored points and his sixth-place finish was [...] "significant" [...] for himself and his team.
