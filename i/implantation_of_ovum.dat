40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} functions of the placenta is the regulation of the maternal immune response such that the fetal semi-allograft is tolerated during pregnancy. Trophoblasts are presumed to be essential to this phenomenon because they lie at the maternal–fetal interface, where they are in direct contact with cells of the maternal immune system. Trophoblasts do not express classic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Surprisingly, cytotrophoblasts express more HLA-G, a MHC class Ib molecule, as they invade the uterus. Progesterone {{plays an important role in}} postovulatory regulation of the menstrual cycle. If fertilization occurs, progesterone supports <b>implantation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ovum</b> and maintains the pregnancy. Progesterone has been named the ‘hormone of pregnancy’, because in preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation and facilitating endometrial development, it is critical to the very survival of a pregnancy. In addition, this key hormone inhibits the rejection of T cell-mediated tissue and also decreases myometrial activity and sensitivity throughout pregnancy. The cellular actions of progesterone are mediated through intracellular progesterone receptors (PRs), which are well studied gene regulators, not express classic major histocompatibility complex.

The goal {{of this study was to}} compare clinical and laboratory findings in women who have undergone laparoscopy or laparotomy for EP. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 103 women, who had undergone laparoscopic or laparotomy treatment due to EP diagnosis, were enrolled.

Past fertility history, past medical and drug history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings (including Hb and serum β-hCG levels), size of EP mass and its location, endometrial thickness, free fluid in pelvic or abdominal cavity, type of treatment, and method were recorded. Results: Of the study population, 58 had undergone laparotomy and 45 had undergone laparoscopy.

40|$|Ectopic {{pregnancy}} denotes {{a pregnancy}} occurring elsewhere {{than in the}} cavity of the uterus. This pathology has been recog-nised for years and it causes numerous maternal deaths during the first trimester of pregnancy. While this condition is well-known in humans, it is rarely diagnosed in animals. However, the causes and mechanisms leading to an ectopic <b>implantation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ovum</b> are not always clearly defined in humans or animals. Two types of ectopic pregnancy are mainly recognized: (1) tubal pregnancy occurs when an oocyte is fertilized and then remains in the oviduct and (2) abdominal pregnancy occurs when the gestation develops in the peritoneal cavity. The latter may be subdivided into two subtypes: the primary form, when a fertilized oocyte enters the peritoneal cavity and becomes attached to the mesentery or abdominal viscera, and the second-ary form, which follows the rupture of an oviduct or the uterus after the fetus has been implanted, and the fetus is expelled into the peritoneal cavity. Cornual, ovarian and cervical ectopic locations are less frequent. Several differences exist in ectopic pregnancies between human beings and animal species. While abdominal pregnancy has been described in both human and animal species, tubal ectopic pregnancies {{would appear to be}} restricted to primates.

Indomethacin has previously been shown to inhibit the <b>implantation</b> <b>of</b> the fertilised <b>ovum</b> into the uterus wall of pregnant rats. It is proposed that nonoxynol- 9, in combination with a non-selective NSAID may exhibit both anti-implantation and spermicidal properties. Methods Both novel derivatives and nonoxynol- 9 were then tested on boar spermatozoa {{in order to establish}} if spermicidal activity was retained following the esterification. Results The results showed that both the ibuprofen and indomethacin derivatives enabled complete cell death of boar spermatozoa at a concentration of 100 µg ml- 1, which is comparable to nonoxynol- 9 at the same concentration. Conclusions These results indicate that NSAID derivatives of nonoxynol- 9 retain the activity of the parent molecule and may have other advantages associated with the molecular incorporation of the NSAID moieties and their anti-implantation activity.

30|$|Ectopic {{pregnancy}} (EP) {{refers to}} the <b>implantation</b> <b>of</b> a viable <b>ovum</b> outside the uterine corpus. Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is the simultaneous occurrence of gestations at two or more implantation sites. It is most often manifested as concomitant intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and EP [1]. Although EP is not uncommon in women of reproductive age, HP is rare in the general population, with an incidence of 1 : 7, 963 – 30, 000 in spontaneous conceptions [2]. The increased incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), the common usage of ovulation inducing agents, and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) {{have contributed to the}} increasing incidence of both multiple gestations and HP in the last decade. The rate of HP after in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been reported to be as high as 1 % [2, 3], although it’s true incidence is unknown. Most recent studies exhibit the incidence about 152 per 100, 000 pregnancies in ART cycles [4]. Due to the difficulty in the diagnosis, rupture of the tube, bleeding, and the need for emergency operations are seen more often in heterotopic than in ectopic pregnancies. Thus, all pregnancies as a result of ART must be evaluated cautiously. Here, we report a triplet heterotopic pregnancy, which was successfully diagnosed and treated by laparoscopy.|$|R

She had no complaints and was clinically stable; however her pregnancy test was positive. Uterine bleeding was not observed and roughly 5 cm smooth edged and mobile right adnexal mass showing no tenderness with palpation was detected during pelvic examination. Transvaginal sonography showed {{that there was an}} endometrium in 25 mm thickness and there was no gestational sac. Left ovarian logy was normal, but an exitus embryo with a crown-rump length (CRL) measuring 11 mm (at 7 weeks, 2 days gestation) was detected on the right adnexal area. It was recorded that there was no fluid in the pouch of Douglas and the right ovary could not be distinguished. Laparoscopy was suggested and then laparoscopic right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed upon detection of ovarian pregnancy.

We examined 24 patients with ectopic pregnancies which we divided according to the days of amenorrhea into two groups: the first group with the total of 28 patients from 16 – 42 days and another group of 8 patients with amenorrhea longer than 42 days. The control group was comprised of 20 patients with vital intrauterine pregnancy, gestational age of 42 - 52 days. Blood samples for quantitative determination of hormones were collected on three occasions after 48 hours in the forenoon time in the examined and control group of pregnant women. Ultrasonographic examinations of all pregnant women were carried out immediately after blood sampling, with the trans-vaginal approach using "make loop" option, and measurements with an accuracy of 0. 1 mm. Mean values for beta-hCG range from 698 - 1774 mlU/ml in the first group of pregnant women, and in the second group of 1896 mlU/ml to 4410 mlU/ml with a statistically significant difference compared to the values in the control group (p < 0. 001). The concentration of progesterone in the first group of women ranging from 41 - 70 nmol/l, and in the second group of 76 - 94 nmol/l which is also the statistically significant difference compared to the control group (p< 0. 002). We have shown that ultrasonographic finding with its parameters reliably predicts the values of biochemical parameters both in normal intrauterine pregnancy and in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Embryo viability and implantation place condition the values of biochemical parameters, which makes establishing the correct diagnose difficult by following only these markers.
