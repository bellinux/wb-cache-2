5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000.

For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people <b>each</b> <b>day.</b> <b>With</b> fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese macaque is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn {{to early}} winter, macaques feed in between {{different}} activities. In the winter, macaques have {{two to four}} feeding bouts <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they {{have two or three}} bouts of feeding daily. In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities. Macaques usually sleep in trees, but also sleep on the ground, as well as on or near rocks and fallen trees. During the winter, macaques huddle together for warmth in sleeping grounds. Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up.|$|E
25|$|Cardboard, {{aluminium}} foil, {{and plastic}} bags {{for well over}} 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in Chad by the combined efforts of the Jewish World Watch, the Dutch foundation KoZon, and SCI.

The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered.
