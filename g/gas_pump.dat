Since the increased occurrence of static-related fires many stations have warnings about leaving the refueling point.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly growing {{consumption}} {{of natural gas}} {{all around the world}} requires development of new transporting equipment and optimization of existing pipelines and <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> facilities. As a special case, Russian <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> system has the longest pipes with large diameter, which carry great amounts of natural gas. So, as reconstruction and modernization needs large investments, a need of more effective and low cost tool appeared. As a result diagnostics became the most wide-spread method for lifecycle assessment, and lifecycle extension for <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> units and pipelines. One of the most effective method for diagnostics of <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> units is parametric diagnostics. It is based on evaluation of measurement of several termo-gas dynamic parameters of <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> units, such as pressures, temperatures and rotational speed of turbines and compressors. In my work I developed and examined a special case of parametric diagnostics – methodic for evaluation of technical state and output parameters for <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> unit “Ural- 16 ”. My work contains detailed analysis of various defects, classified by different GPU’s systems. The results of this analysis are later used in development of the methodic for calculation of output parameters for <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> unit. GPU is an extremely complex object for diagnostics. Around 200 combinations of Gas Turbine engines with centrifugal superchargers, different operational conditions and other aspects require development of separate methodic almost for each <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> unit type. Development of each methodic is a complex work which requires gathering of all possible parametric and statistical data for the examined <b>gas</b> <b>pumping</b> unit. Also parameters of compressed gas are measured. Thus as a result a number of equations are formed which finally allow to calculate such parameters as efficiency, fuel gas consumption and technical state coefficient which couldn’t be measured directly by existing measuring equipment installed on the gas compressor station...|$|R

2500|$|The Marchant, however, has, {{for every}} one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio [...] "preselector transmission" [...] with its output spur gear {{at the top of the}} machine's body; that gear engages the {{accumulator}} gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the <b>gas</b> <b>pump.</b> Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.|$|E

60|$|In a dentist's {{operating}} room on a fine August morning in 1896. Not the usual tiny London den, {{but the best}} sitting room of a furnished lodging in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place. The operating chair, with a <b>gas</b> <b>pump</b> and cylinder beside it, is half way between {{the centre of the}} room and one of the corners. If you look into the room through the window which lights it, you will see the fireplace {{in the middle of the}} wall opposite you, with the door beside it to your left; an M.R.C.S. diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece; an easy chair covered in black leather on the hearth; a neat stool and bench, with vice, tools, and a mortar and pestle in the corner to the right. Near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a stand, a pedal, and an exaggerated winch. Recognising this as a dental drill, you shudder and look away to your left, where you can see another window, underneath which stands a writing table, with a blotter and a diary on it, and a chair. Next the writing table, towards the door, is a leather covered sofa. The opposite wall, close on your right, is occupied mostly by a bookcase. The operating chair is under your nose, facing you, with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left. You observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new, and that the wall paper, designed, with the taste of an undertaker, in festoons and urns, the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich, cabbagy nosegays, the glass gasalier with lustres; the ornamental gilt rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf, also glass- draped with lustres, and the ormolu clock under a glass-cover in the middle between them, its uselessness emphasized by a cheap American clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 o'clock noon, all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the air of a miniature family vault, to suggest early Victorian commercial respectability, belief in money, Bible fetichism, fear of hell always at war with fear of poverty, instinctive horror of the passionate character of art, love and Roman Catholic religion, and all the first fruits of plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution.|$|E
