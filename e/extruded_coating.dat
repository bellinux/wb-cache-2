40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) interconnects, {{which are made}} of chromia-forming {{ferritic}} stainless steels, are used to connect individual SOFCs in series to increase the overall cell voltage output. They are usually exposed to high operating temperature (around 800 oC) and both oxidative and reductive atmosphere. Mn 1. 5 Co 1. 5 O 4 (MCO) spinel is used for SOFC interconnect coating to decrease the oxidation rate and the chromium migration, and to increase the SOFC lifetime. The current preferred coating method is air-plasma spray (APS) which has transfer efficiency of only around 40 %, and is relatively expansive. The objective of this project is to develop powder coating technology as an alternative in SOFC interconnect coating, given its environmental friendliness, recyclability and cost-effectiveness. However, the key problems of powder coating techniques are how to make MCO powder well dispersed in polymer matrix (also known as coating binder, i. e. the resin and corresponding curing agent) and to form uniform film after binder burn off. Four techniques of mixing and dispersing MCO powder were investigated in this project. Slurry powder coating showed a big tendency to form a good film, a further optimization is needed. Both thermally compacted and cold pressed powder coatings showed poor quality and severe defects of non-uniformity. The formed film by <b>extruded</b> powder <b>coating</b> exhibited excellent adhesion, moderate hardness and high gloss. This technique {{is the best of}} four and is used for SOFC interconnect testing. For SOFC interconnects by <b>extruded</b> powder <b>coating,</b> thickness of the coating observed by cross-section analysis was fairly uniform, which is a key advantage of this technique. But a significant change in coating morphology was observed after thermal treatment, mainly due to the high dosage of binder used in the formulation. <b>Extruded</b> powder <b>coating</b> is promising but needs to be further optimized for SOFC application...|$|R
50|$|Curtain coating is {{a process}} that creates an {{uninterrupted}} curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate. The substrate is transported on a conveyor belt or calender rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die. The curtain is created by using a slit or die {{at the base of the}} holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and <b>extruded</b> for <b>coating.</b> Many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.|$|R

40|$|Textural {{characteristics}} of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals were evaluated {{in order to}} determine the influence of wheat, corn and rice flour, as well as a varying water addition during the extrusion process. Extruded breakfast cereal balls were made of wheat semolina in combination with wheat, corn or rice flour. Three different levels of water addition (21 %, 23 % and 27 %) were used during the extrusion process. Samples were prepared with and without surface sugar coating. Sensory and instrumental assessments (TA. XT Plus) were used to evaluate textural attributes of dry samples and samples during immersion in milk. Weibull equation was used for nonlinear estimation of experimental data obtained for milk absorption and crispiness as a function of time. Crispiness of dry <b>extruded</b> balls without <b>coating</b> was much higher than for samples with coating. The highest values for crispness were observed for wheat extruded balls and the lowest for samples with corn flour addition. Increasing water addition during the extrusion process significantly increased crispness of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. The rate of milk absorption and loss of crispiness were significantly higher for samples without coating than for samples with coating...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion is a {{metal forming}} process used {{extensively}} in industry to produce different structural, mechanical, electrical, architectural, automotive and aerospace application parts. Currently after extrusion, the rod {{is subjected to}} environmental wear due to long storage time and hence requires an additional cleaning process before further use. This cleaning process can be eliminated by <b>extruding</b> a polymer <b>coated</b> metal rod workpiece such that the polymer coating is sustained on the final product after the extrusion process. In the present research study a new upper bound analytical model is developed to predict the forces required to conduct extrusion of a polymer coated metal rod successfully. The search for the lower upper bound power functional is modeled as a non linear optimization problem. Optimizing the functional also determines the set of constraints defining the shape of rigid plastic deformation boundaries and the final coating thickness. Also an upper bound analytical model was developed to predict forces for failure of the polymer coating during the extrusion. Both the analytical models for successful and failed extrusion are compared to obtain critical die angle which can provide tooling and process design guidelines. Finite element analysis simulations were modeled using commercially available software package, ABAQUS. Predictions of FEA simulations were in good agreement with published results and with the predictions of analytical model developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of five dietary lipid sources (fish oil as control—C; canola oil—CO; poultry fat—PF; pork lard—PL; and oleine oil—OO) were evaluated in juvenile brown trout (58. 4 ± 0. 7 g) {{in an experiment}} conducted over 70 days at 14. 6 ± 0. 4 °C. The best growth was observed in fish fed the C diet whereas the PL diet fed fish had the best feed utilization. Significant differences in carcass and muscle proximate composition, but not in liver, were noted among fish fed the different dietary treatments. The fatty acid composition of muscle largely reflected that of the diets, while total cholesterol was not affected. The atherogenicity and the thrombogenicity qualities of the trout flesh were modified by the lipid sources. Sensory analysis did not show any significant differences among the cooked fillets with respect to dietary treatments, while in uncooked products, some significant differences were observed. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II (CPT-I and CPT-II) activities of liver and white muscle were assayed for {{a better understanding of}} the potential β-oxidation capability of the different dietary lipid sources.

40|$|A {{standard}} experimental diet {{was developed}} to study lipid nutrition in marine fish larvae during weaning and first ongrowing. Basal diets were prepared by extrusion-cooking, crumbling of the pellets, and sieving to obtain particles in the size ranges 150 - 300 µm and 300 - 500 µm. Three protein sources in the extruded basal diet were evaluated: (1) micronized cod protein granulate (COD); (2) a mixture of casein, gelatin, and albumin (CGA); (3) a mixture of cod fish meal, whey protein, soybean protein concentrate, albumin, hemoglobin meal, and wheat gluten (MIX). A variable lipid fraction {{was added to the}} <b>extruded</b> nucleus by <b>coating</b> the particles with an emulsion, coconut oil (COCO), or fish oil emulsion (FO), in a fluidized bed granulator. European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) were weaned and consequently reared for 3 weeks on the experimental diets in a recirculation system. A commercial diet and the uncoated COD diet served as control diets. The suitability of the diets was assessed {{on the basis of the}} water stability of the particles, survival, growth, resistance to higher salinity stress of the fish, and tissue fatty acid composition. The MIX diet may hold promise as a standard basal diet for lipid nutrition research with marine fish species during weaning and first ongrowing.

Small angle X-ray scattering results revealed that neighboring cationic liposomes either stick together after a partial coating of low concentration HA or disperse completely in excess of HA, but they never assemble as multilamellar vesicles. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy images confirm the existence of unilamellar vesicles and large aggregates of unilamellar vesicles for HA fractions up to 80 % (w/w). High concentrations of HA (> 20 % w/w) proved to be efficient for <b>coating</b> <b>extruded</b> liposomes, leading to particle complexes with sizes in the nanoscale range and a negative zeta potential.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy and EPRI are co-funding {{this project}} {{to improve the}} control of mercury {{emissions}} from coal-fired power plants equipped with wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems. The project is investigating catalytic oxidation of vapor-phase elemental mercury to a form that is more effectively captured in wet FGD systems. If successfully developed, the process could be applicable to over 90, 000 MW of utility generating capacity with existing FGD systems, and to future FGD installations. Field tests are being conducted to determine whether candidate catalyst materials remain active towards mercury oxidation after extended flue gas exposure. Catalyst life will have a large impact on the cost effectiveness of this potential process. A mobile catalyst test unit {{is being used to}} test the activity of four different catalysts for a period of up to six months at each of three utility sites. Catalyst testing at the first site, which fires Texas lignite, was completed in December 1998. Testing at the second test site, which fires a Powder River Basin subbituminous coal, was completed in the fall of 1999, and testing at the third site, which fires a high-sulfur bituminous coal, will begin in 2000. This technical note reports results from Site 2; results from Site 1 were reported in a previous technical note. At Site 2, catalysts were tested in several forms, including powders dispersed in sand bed reactors and in commercial forms such as <b>extruded</b> beads and <b>coated</b> honeycomb structures.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{progress has}} been seen in recent years {{around the world in}} the construction of cable-stayed bridges, as well as in suspension bridges. As longer cable-stayed bridges have come to be constructed, the multiple-cable system with mono-strand cables has become popular. Stay cables of such long cable-stayed bridges are required to possess excellent mechanical properties, such as a high static and high fatigue strength, and a superior corrosion protective coat. There were few cables in the past which satisfied those requirements, therefore it was necessary to do a study on them. This thesis describes the study on the development of a new-type cable for long cable-stayed bridges, and application subjects for large cable-supported structures. Details of the studies are presented respectively. A slight twist of the wires given to the cable made it possible to coat it with a corrosion protective layer in the manufacturing process and to improve handleability such as installation at the site without damaging the structural performance. It was indicated that the pre- coated parallel wire cable had the same static characteristics (such as the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity) as those of a parallel wire strand, when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. It was also shown that the twisting angle had little effect on the time dependent characteristics (such as creep and relaxation) when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. Finally, the tensile test was carried out by using full-size cable models and it was confirmed that a pre-coated parallel wire cable with a breaking load of a 3, 000 tonf (29, 400 kN) class could be put into practical use. A new fatigue resistant socket having a composite-filler consisting of an epoxy resin and a zinc-copper alloy was developed in order to improve the fatigue strength of a socket. It was confirmed that the socket had a higher fatigue strength of about 25 kgf/mm^ 2 (245 MPa). It was confirmed that the socket had a higher fatigue strength of the socket when the twisting angle of a cable was less than 3. 5 °. Experimental results and analysis indicated that the pre-coated parallel wire cable with the sockets had a bending fatigue strength of about 0. 6 °and the socket using epoxy resin also had an effect on decreasing the secondary stress at the entrance of a socket. A new method in socket design for a large cable, introducing the concept of rigidity for ultimate strength, was examined. As a new protection system against corrosion, an <b>extruded</b> polyethylene <b>coating</b> for a parallel wire cable was developed, which eliminated the need for corrosion protective coating work at the site. A high-density polyethylene was selected as the optimum protective coating material. According to the accelerated weathering test results, it was confirmed that the polyethylene showed no deterioration when 1 % carbon black was added. The properties of a polyethylene coated cable were analyzed, and installation characteristics of the cable such as unreeling and clamping were examined using full-size cable models. It was indicated that this protection system was a great advantage in the erection of stay cables of cable-stayed bridges, especially long ones. In addition to fundamental development, the cable that could be applied to any cable-supported structures was also required to have higher performance. One of the application subjects was to make the cable colored and durable. The other was to develop aerodynamic measures against cable vibration to lengthen cable-stayed bridge spans. Details of the investigations with respect to these subjects and the results obtained by the study (a fluoropolymer-coated colored cable and a low drag aerodynamically stable cable with an indented pattern), were presented. A colored cable using a fluoropolymer having outstanding weathering durability was developed. The material properties of the fluoropolymer, especially the weathering durability, were evaluated by using various exposure test methods. It became obvious that the fluoropolymer had excellent weathering durability, which could be estimated to last for more than 100 years if the thickness were 1 mm or more. Structural characteristics of the fluoropolymer-covered cable were examined, and it was indicated that the cable had the same installation properties as those of a polyethylene-coated cable. These characteristics of the fluoropolymer showed that it could be used for various structures and elongated service life and added aesthetic aspects. As a result, a greater freedom of color selection was given to bridge cables that matched the surrounding environment. Finally, it was shown that the colored cable was applied not only to stay cables of long cable-stayed bridges but also to hangers of long suspension bridges. The vibration problems of a stay cable were surveyed and experimental studies on cable vibration and its suppressing method for a long cable-stayed bridge were discussed. After examining the aerodynamic characteristics of a cable with a patterned roughness, using wind tunnel tests, a new aerodynamical cable having both a low drag force and a suppression effect on rain vibration was developed. It was found that it had the same drag coefficient of about 0. 6 as that of a cable with a smooth surface in any design wind velocity range. It was also found that a cable with a surface roughness had a vibration suppressing effect when the relative surface roughness had a vibration suppressing effect when the relative surface roughness of 1 % of the cable diameter was given discretely on the surface. Suppression effects were analyzed by measurement of the drag coefficient and pressure distribution, indicating that cables with a lumped pattern roughness made it possible to reproduce a supercritical state at a low wind velocity range where rain vibrations occurred. To understand further the aerodynamic characteristics of the surface configuration of the cable, various patterned roughnesses were examined in terms of the Reynolds Numbers. It was found that density and arrangement of lumped roughness were the key factors in controlling the drag characteristics of cables, and that optimization of the drag coefficient-Reynolds number relationship could enable adjusting those two factors. Responses of stay cables by vortex-induced vibration in natural wind were measured at an actual cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 490 m. The factors affecting this vibration, such as surface roughness and structural damping, were examined by using a wind tunnel test and analysis. It was shown that the response amplitude was estimated at various damping levels, and that the bending angle of a cable, caused by vortex-induced vibration, to be less than 0. 1 °, which had little effect on the secondary stress and bending fatigue strength of cables. Cable materials in the future for a super-long cable supported bridge were described. It was shown that the development of cable material was inevitable in order to lengthen a bridge span of a super-long suspension bridge. The present status of cable materials including steel wires and various new materials was surveyed and future problems to overcome were pointed out. As a future prospect, a high strength steel material and a light weight material such as carbon fiber were shown to be possible for use in super-long cable supported bridges. In conclusion, several ideas for the new-type cable discussed here helped in the lengthening cable-stayed bridge spans, and contributed a great deal to the advancement of cable-supported structures. 横浜国立大学, 平成 8 年 6 月 30 日, 博士(工学), 乙第 107...|$|R
