Presence of two isoforms of enzyme in nodules of both lupine species was shown. The comparison of properties of studied metleghemoglobin reductases from different legume plants was made. Possible mechanisms of their functioning in nodules are discussing. For normal run of nitrogen fixation process optimal oxygen conditions in nodules of legume plants are necessary. One {{of the most important}} parts of system regulating these conditions is special plant hemoprotein—leghemoglobin. It is possible to bind oxygen and to form oxygenated LbO 2 form only in physiologically active reduced state. Two ways of supporting leghemoglobin in reduced state are known: enzymatic (reducing by metleghemoglobin reductase) and non-enzymatic (reducing by <b>indolyl-acetic</b> <b>acid</b> [1], reduced flavins [2], cysteine, ascorbic acid and low molecular weight component B [3]). Thanks to presence of several enzymatic and non-enzymatic reductants in nodule cytosol the considerable removal of Lb 3 + ⇄ Lb 2 + balance to formation of reduced hemoprotein is observing, norm of physiological reaction of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing system is extending, and optimal regime for nitrogen fixation are supporting at widely changing conditions. Our calculations show that enzymatic reduction makes the main contribution to Lb supporting in reduced state. Process of Lb enzymatic reduction was firstly describe...|$|E
