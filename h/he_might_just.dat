25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
500|$|... "Borderland" [...] first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 29, 2004. The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Bianco highlighted the episode as one {{to watch in}} his preview column for USA Today. Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune praised the return of Brent Spiner to Star Trek, saying [...] "Surprise, fear, elation, self-control; they're all given masterful life by Spiner {{in the space of}} a few seconds." [...] The reviewer at IGN thought that the episode was a return to the quality of [...] "", and praised the abilities of Spiner. The teaser trailer was compared to that of a Quentin Tarantino film, and a score of 3/5 was given saying [...] "Executive Producer Manny Coto has a long way to go if he has any hope of making up for Enterprise's transgressions the past three years but if this three episode story arc lives up to the promise shown in Borderland, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> pull it off." [...] Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She said that she liked the premise of the episode, but felt that the execution was sub-par, describing the augments as [...] "Khannabees" [...] and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E
2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, {{there are going to be}} things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E

60|$|Yes, Paddy the Beaver {{was very}} happy. He {{would have been}} {{perfectly}} happy except for one thing. Farmer Brown's boy had found his dam and pond that very afternoon, and Paddy wasn't quite sure what Farmer Brown's boy <b>might</b> do. <b>He</b> had kept himself snugly hidden while Farmer Brown's boy was there, and he felt quite sure that Farmer Brown's boy didn't know who had built the dam. But for this reason <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>might,</b> {{try to find out}} all about it, and that would mean that Paddy would always {{have to be on the}} watch.|$|R

50|$|When Chris {{receives}} a second obscene call, Snapper is livid. He {{has vowed to}} tear Ron Becker apart if Chris is bothered again, and Chris is worried that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do <b>just</b> that when she sees the anger Snapper is harboring.|$|R
60|$|And George Forsyte, crony of his father, racing still! The Mayfly strain--was it {{any better}} than any other? <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have a flutter with his money instead.|$|E
60|$|The Fives {{carried on}} the story. Menzies was swamped by a Day's man. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have stayed away altogether. The star of Seymour's was very low on the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "So foolish!" [...] she declared. [...] "He hasn't a {{shilling}} in the world, and {{he never}} wins anything. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have {{come down here and}} made himself agreeable to Lois." ...|$|E
50|$|On 21 July 2011, Libyan {{opposition}} sources {{claimed that}} Senussi {{had been killed}} in an attack by armed rebels in Tripoli; however, a few hours later the same sources recanted on their earlier claim and some even said <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have <b>just</b> been injured.|$|R
50|$|After horrible letdowns {{and awkward}} dating situations, Charlie finds Amy, a down-to-earth coworker who <b>he</b> thinks <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{be the one}} to accept him.

60|$|But then, to have {{no claim}} upon her, he must stand by himself, in sheer nothingness. And his brain turned to nought at the idea. It was a state of nothingness. On the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> give in, and fawn to her. Or, finally, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> kill her. Or <b>he</b> <b>might</b> become <b>just</b> indifferent, purposeless, dissipated, momentaneous. But his nature was too serious, not gay enough or subtle enough for mocking licentiousness.|$|R
60|$|Isaac made no reply. Only his long, skinny {{forefinger}} {{shot out}} toward the door. Arnold knew that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{as well have been}} talking to the most hopeless lunatic ever confined in padded room.|$|E
60|$|The second {{hole was}} shorter. Gossett won it in three. The third {{he took in}} six, the fourth in four. Archibald began to feel that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well not be there. He was {{practically}} a spectator.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't," [...] said poor Janet pathetically. [...] "You see, Anne, I've {{always been}} awful fond of John. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well keep coming as not, {{for there was}} never anybody else I'd want, so it didn't matter." ...|$|E

60|$|From this tameness and submission, {{his next}} Step was {{to argue that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> depend upon it the Solunarian Church had so {{sincerely}} embrac'd the Doctrine of Non-Resistance, that they were now ripen'd not only to sit still, and see their Brethren the Crolians suppress'd, but to stand still and be opprest themselves, and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> assure himself the Matter was now ripe, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do <b>just</b> what <b>he</b> wou'd himself with them, they were prepar'd to bare any thing.|$|R
6000|$|JOY. When <b>he</b> comes I <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{as well go}} to bed. [Passionately.] And now he's chosen to-day to {{come down}} here, when I haven't seen her for two months! Why couldn't he come when Mother and I'd gone home. It's simply brutal! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] she said, [...] "indirect {{influences}} scarcely count, or {{one might}} trace {{the causes of}} everything which happens back to an absurd extent. If this man was mad <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have shot Brott for anything." ...|$|E
60|$|James {{had done}} his best, but he {{found it hard to}} get rid of his {{reputation}} for getting into mischief, and more than once, when falsely suspected, he grumbled that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well have the fun of the thing, for he was sure to have the blame.|$|E
6000|$|... "He may {{possibly}} {{have something in}} mind of which I know nothing," [...] answered James Morris thoughtfully. [...] "It is too bad!

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{called it}} [...] "idolatry {{on behalf of}} Robert Redford."

60|$|As one of {{the miners}} here {{explained}} hastily why it was that justice had been meted out with such promptitude, our hero drew back and left the spot, feeling, however, that Judge Lynch was a very dangerous character, seeing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be <b>just</b> as prompt with the innocent as with the guilty, although he would find it rather difficult to recall life if he should find out afterwards {{that he had been}} mistaken in his views.|$|R
60|$|Samuel Marlowe, muffled in a bathrobe, {{came back}} to the state-room from his tub.

6000|$|... "I {{never said}} I had met him. I only go by what I {{have heard of}} him. And as far as I know, he is not at any school.

"Wal, we don't {{know much}} about {{machines}} and things, but I guess we'd better go out and keep you men from fightin'," [...] said Mrs. Gray, shaking with fun; [...] "Ike didn't come because he didn't want to make any trouble, but I guess <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well 'a' come as send two such critters as Jim 'n' Hank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{have done}} wisely," [...] Charlie said.
