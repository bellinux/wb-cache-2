5|$|Arturo Garcia, {{chairman}} of the Coaches Association of Santa Cruz in Bolivia, told the Bolivian newspaper La Razón he had proof that at least five players in the Bolivian boys' football team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the age limit of 15 years. Bolivia beat Haiti 5–0 to take {{the gold medal in}} the finals of the boys' football tournament on 25 August 2010.

The Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara (EDC), who had requested {{the release of the}} records along with the Santa Barbara Channelkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the agency in December 2015 since it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> six months and they had not received any of the requested documents.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} moved westward under the {{influence}} of a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Despite having reached tropical cyclone intensity according to Perth TCWC, it was not assigned a name. Once the storm crossed 90°E on March25, the Météo-France's La Réunion Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (MFR) began tracking the system as a moderate tropical storm, giving it the name Hudah. Gradually intensifying, Hudah developed an eye with an eyewall primarily in the northern semicircle, indicated by a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass over the system. On March26, Hudah ceased strengthening as cloud tops warmed and the eye became no longer evident. Atmospheric divergence remained favorable, and Hudah eventually restrengthened, attaining tropical cyclone intensity at 0000UTC on March27, while located approximately 1,200km (750mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. This period of strengthening was short-lived, likely due to dry air. The cloud structure fluctuated as well, with a poorly-defined eye appearing at times on satellite imagery. Hudah was able to attain an initial peak intensity of 155km/h (95mph) at 0600UTC on March29 according to the MFR, shortly after passing 1010km (630mi) south of Diego Garcia. An anticyclone that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> Hudah showed signs of weakening later that day, spurring an increase in wind shear and causing weakening. This period of weakening was short-lived, and Hudah resumed its former strengthening trend by the night of March30 as shear decreased and convective organization and areal extent increased. After passing 275km (170mi) north of Rodrigues Island, Hudah attained intense tropical cyclone status by 1200UTC on March31. Satellite imagery indicated a large, cloud-free eye, indicative of a strong tropical cyclone.|$|E

25|$|Grossman and Friedman knew during Joplin's {{lifetime}} {{that her}} friend Caserta, whom Friedman met during the New York sessions for Cheap Thrills and on later occasions, used heroin. During the many long-distance telephone conversations that Joplin and Friedman had in September 1970 and on October 1, Joplin never mentioned Caserta, and Friedman assumed Caserta {{had been out}} of Joplin's life for a while. Friedman, who had more time than Grossman to monitor the situation, never visited California. She thought Joplin sounded on the phone like she was less depressed than she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the summer.|$|E

25|$|There <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> {{the years}} {{a number of}} {{proposals}} or recommendations for the risk assessment of the signalling in the Paddington area; {{none of them was}} carried into effect. Multiple SPADs at SN109 in August 1998 should have triggered a risk assessment; none took place. An inquiry into a February 1998 SPAD at SN109 had already recommended risk assessment of signalling on the Paddington – Ladbroke Grove bi-directional lines; this and many other inquiry recommendations had not been implemented: the Railtrack employee with formal responsibility for action-tracking had been told his responsibility ended once someone accepted an action, and did not extend to checking that they had acted upon it.|$|E
25|$|In 1810 John Crawfurd {{assumed the}} name Lindsay and {{claimed to be}} descended from the Hon. James Crawfurd, third son of the first Viscount Garnock.

To add some credibility to the claim he had claimed that his forebear had been the eldest son and heir and had been forced to flee to Ireland after having murdered a man in a duel by firing before the signal. This duel he claimed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> a matter of honour relating to the Lady Susanna Kennedy, later Countess of Eglinton, with whom he was entirely smitten.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} a draw, {{the first time}} that the First Test of an Ashes series had been drawn in Australia since 1881-82. The general opinion was that Benaud should have {{declared}} earlier and that had it been any other team he would have done so. In previous Ashes series Down Under the 30 hours play <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> six days, which with a rest day meant a seven-day-old pitch by the end, which usually produced a result. Still Australia (having won the toss) had the better of the draw and had played the more positive cricket. In the England team only Fred Trueman with the ball and Ted Dexter with the bat had shown any aggression.|$|E

25|$|More {{men were}} made {{redundant}} when this {{work had been}} completed in mid-December 1961. The remainder covered the spoil heaps with organic material to encourage vegetation, and demolished the old stone-walled buildings of the Smelt Mill, the Silver Refinery and the Smith's Shop. A miners' hostel was converted into a Youth Hostel. Workmen living in the many houses were helped to buy them at reduced prices. Then, on 31 January 1962 the last twelve men were paid their final wages, and the office keys were {{handed over to the}} landowners' solicitors. There <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 100 pupils at the school in Patterdale in the 1950s; after the mine closed the school roll fell to less than 20 children.

25|$|Most {{debate in}} civil-military {{relations}} assumed that a {{separation between the}} civilian and military world was inevitable and likely necessary. The argument <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> whether to control {{the gap between the}} two (Huntington) or to minimize the gap by enacting certain policies (Janowitz). Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, however, the discussion began to focus {{on the nature of the}} apparent gap between civilian and military cultures and, more specifically, whether that gap had reached such proportions as to pose a danger to civilian control of the military. Part of the debate was based on the cultural differences between the more liberal civilian society and the conservative military society, and on the recognition that such differences had apparently become more pronounced than in past years.|$|E
25|$|Their parents' {{marriage}} was unhappy, however, particularly as Maria Clotilde preferred the quieter, more duty-filled life {{that she felt}} they should maintain, while Napoléon Joseph preferred the faster, more entertainment-filled lifestyle of the French court. Another factor in their unhappy {{marriage was}} the circumstances leading up to their espousal. Maria Clotilde had been only 15 when they were married, while he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 37 years old. The marriage had also been negotiated out of political reasons during the conference of Plombières (July 1858). As Maria Clotilde was too young at the time for marriage, Napoléon Joseph had {{had to wait until}} the following year; many had disapproved of the speed he undertook collecting his young bride in Turin. Their marriage was often compared to that of an elephant and a gazelle; the bridegroom had strong Napoleonic features (broad, bulky, and ponderous) while the bride appeared frail, short, fair-haired, and with the characteristic nose of the House of Savoy.|$|E

500|$|Seeking the {{challenge}} of racing on cobbles is relatively recent.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{influenced}} by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, written by John le Carré. Both the book and author are favorites of Shiban. Because the Cold War <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over,</b> he used the opportunity to introduce a new [...] "bogeyman", in this case domestic terrorism. The writing staff used then-recent fears about Saddam Hussein's alleged production of biological weapons to craft the basic premise of the script. The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons. Shiban also recalled that the 1995 action film Heat was an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{dismissed}} {{suggestions that}} his team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> physical in previous meetings against Arsenal. Referring back to the league fixture in October 2004, he told reporters: [...] "We committed three fouls on Reyes, for instance, but that hardly constitutes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, does it? There were six by them on Cristiano Ronaldo." [...] He questioned the character of Arsenal's players after they lost their unbeaten record, and likened their protest to propaganda, {{as a way to}} disguise their crisis – [...] "...it was convenient for them to say they were kicked off the park." [...] United had struggled to score goals in the lead up to the final, and Ferguson stressed the importance of his team taking their chances. [...] "Big games are usually decided that way. They are so close so that whoever gets in front has an advantage," [...] he said.|$|E
