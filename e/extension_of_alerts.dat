It can also be seen as an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the standard <b>Alert</b> problem. In our paper we consider the λ-Alert problem in various settings. We describe characteristics of oblivious and adaptive deterministic algorithms for the model with and without collision detection. We also show some results for randomized algorithms.

In order to solve highmortality rate problem, the government of Daerah IstimewaYogyakarta (DIY), including District of Sleman, is carrying outthe policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village. Method: The study used literature review based onreferences and field data which were issued by Health Office. Result: The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village has less positive impact indecreasing maternal mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate,because health assurance scheme still does not meet theneeds of the people, both physical and non-physical. Thedegree of health still has not improved significantly. The policyof alert village needs inter-sectoral financial support. Financialallocation is still mistargeting. People needs vary from onevillage to another, so {{it is necessary to}} have competent andsmart health workers as the implementing agents of HealthDepartment. The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village is still not able to satisfyall stakeholders (government, health workers, and people),because the concept of satisfaction is closely related to theprinciple of justice. Conclusion: The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village is an effort to empowerthe people to be independent in overcoming their healthproblems. But, in District of Sleman the policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village isclassified into unsuccessfull policy. This failure is caused byinsufficiet support in implementating the policy.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} the field of intrusion detection is the management <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> Intrusion Detection Systems tend to produce a high number <b>of</b> <b>alerts,</b> most <b>of</b> them being false positives.

In order to increase the detection rate, the use of multiple IDSs based on heterogeneous detection techniques is a solution but in return it increases the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> to process. Aggregating the alerts coming from multiple heterogeneous IDSs and fusing them is a necessary step before processing the content and the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>alerts.</b> We propose in this paper to define a similarity operator that takes two IDMEF alerts and outputs a similarity value between 0 and 1.

40|$|Abstract – Protecting {{data from}} the intruders on {{internet}} or on the host systems is a very tedious task. The Intrusion Detection System is a technology for detecting suspicious actions or malicious behavior in a system from the unauthorized users or so called intruders. Alerts are produced during the intrusion activity, but when more number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> is produced then handling <b>of</b> these <b>alerts</b> becomes difficult on IDS. In this paper, we propose a layered approach for IDS where the alert information is represented dynamically {{in the form of}} layers and we propose an alert aggregation algorithm where an attack instance is created for similar type <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced and this is clustered to form a meta-alert which can reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced without losing any information. This technique has approaches like generative modeling, in this case the beginning as well as the completion of attack properties and details can be detected and it is a data stream approach, where duplicate or the alerts which are observed many number of times are processed only a few times. By applying these techniques and alert aggregation we can reduce the number <b>of</b> false <b>alert</b> rate and number <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> The goal <b>of</b> the project is to generate meta-alerts from the proposed alert aggregation algorithm and represent all the alert information or the intruder activity on a dynamically representing model. The alert produced and the details <b>of</b> the <b>alert</b> and the action taken are represented in the form of layers on a distinctive layered model. The details <b>of</b> the <b>alert</b> are represented using these layers and further to form a meta-alert. Meta-alerts contain all the relevant information but the amount of data can be reduced progressively. Using the data sets, it is possible to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced while number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low and represent all the alert information in the form of layers on a model...|$|R
40|$|Anomaly {{detection}} {{systems are}} usually employed to monitor database activities {{in order to}} detect security incidents. These systems raise an alert when anomalous activities are detected. The raised alerts have to be analyzed to timely respond to the security incidents. Their analysis, however, is time-consuming and costly. This problem increases with the large number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> often raised by anomaly detection systems. To timely and effectively handle security incidents, alerts should be accompanied by information which allows the understanding of incidents and their context (e. g., root causes, attack type) and their prioritization (e. g., criticality level). Unfortunately, {{the current state of}} affairs regarding the information about alerts provided by existing anomaly detection systems is not very satisfactory. This work presents an anomaly analysis framework that facilitates the analysis <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> raised by an anomaly detection system monitoring a database system. The framework provides an approach to assess the criticality <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> with respect to the disclosure of sensitive information and a feature-based classification <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> according to their associated type of attack. The framework has been deployed as a web-based alert audit tool that provides alert classification and risk-based ranking capabilities, significantly easing the analysis <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> We validate the classification and ranking approaches using synthetic data generated through an existing healthcare management system.
