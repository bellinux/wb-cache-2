40|$|In many CVD {{processes}} {{there is}} a complex interplay between the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> in the vapour and the heterogeneous growth <b>reactions.</b> The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> in the vapour can be enhanced by using hot-wall reactors or photolytic laser-assited CVD with the laser beam in parallel to the substrate surface. In contrast {{to the use of}} photolysis, use of a hot wall reactor does not permit discrination between different <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> in the vapour. This means that new reaction channels can be opened by photolysis and CVD materials different from those grown in a hotwall reactor can be produced. Thermal laser-assisted CVD (TLCVD) differs considerably from large-area CVD. The extreme suppression of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> in the vapour in TLCVD means that other precursors than those used in the large-area CVD are preferred.

40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} of nitrous acid (HONO) were performed from December 12 to December 22, 2015 in both {{urban and suburban}} areas of Beijing to study the formation mechanism of HONO. The measurement campaign in both sites included a clean-haze-clean transformation process. HONO concentrations showed similar variations in the two sites, while they were always higher in the urban area. Moreover, correlations of HONO with NOx, NO 2, NO, PM 2. 5 and relative humidity (RH) were studied to explore possible HONO formation pathways, and the contributions of direct emissions, heterogeneous <b>reactions,</b> and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> were also calculated. This showed that HONO in urban and suburban areas underwent totally different formation procedures, which were affected by meteorological conditions, PM 2. 5 concentrations, direct emissions, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> and heterogeneous reactions. PM 2. 5 concentrations and RH would influence the NO 2 conversion efficiency. Heterogeneous reactions of NO 2 were more efficient in suburban areas and in clean periods while direct emissions and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> contributed more in urban areas and in polluted periods when the concentrations of NOx and NO were at a high level...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of glucose oxidase (GOx) modified poly(o-phenylenediamine) coated Pt disk electrodes to glucose was well-behaved with a rapid response time and displaying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, the glucose response was lowered in a concentration-dependent manner by ascorbic acid when the glucose calibrations {{were carried out}} in solutions containing this reducing agent. The possibility of a homogeneous redox reaction in which the H 2 O 2 generated by tie enzymatic oxidation of glucose at the GOx/polymer surface is consumed by ascorbate was investigated. Similar ''negative'' interference at GOx-modified carbon powder electrodes not involving membranes and for H 2 O 2 calibrations at bare Pt electrodes supported the hypothesis. The observation that this interference could be blocked by the chelating agent EDTA suggests that the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reaction</b> is catalyzed by trace metal ion impurities in solution. A model for the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reaction</b> based on these experimental findings is proposed and tested by comparing quiescent and stirred solutions. No homogeneous interference by uric acid was observed. The electrodes {{were found to be}} free from lipid fouling in vitro, and experiments monitoring brain glucose levels in vivo indicate the absence of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reaction</b> in this environment.
