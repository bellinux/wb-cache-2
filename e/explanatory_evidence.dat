Thus, <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidence</b> that supports an alternative target belief may be more effective in changing prior beliefs than statistical evidence. In an experiment testing this hypothesis, subjects read explanatory (biological) information and/or statistical (epidemiological) information supporting the belief that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cannot be spread by casual contact. Subjects' beliefs on this issue were assessed before and after reading this information. Subjects also evaluated the evidence they read. Finally, the availability of explanations supporting the target belief was assessed. Results indicated that: (1) <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidence</b> produced significant belief change, whereas statistical evidence did not; (2) evaluations of evidence were biased in accord with subjects' initial beliefs; (3) information polarized attitudes, although attitudes changed in the appropriate direction; (4) final beliefs were more congruent with the target alternative belief after subjects read explanatory information than after they read statistical information. Evidence was mixed regarding whether <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidence</b> was less subject to evaluation bias and subsequent attitude polarization than statistical information. In addition, explanation availability mediated the effectiveness of information in determining final beliefs, and evaluations of the evidence mediated the effect of initial beliefs on attitude polarization. A motivational construct, attitudes toward gay men, was related to initial beliefs and belief change [...] those with negative attitudes had more inappropriate beliefs and displayed less change in beliefs than those with moderate attitudes. However, evaluations of evidence were better predicted by initial beliefs than by attitudes toward gay men. This study has clear implications for those attempting to change beliefs, including those responsible for AIDS education: <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidence</b> is more effective than statistical evidence in changing beliefs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this review}} I first compile {{data for the}} {{worldwide}} position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a com-bination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable ‘‘modulatory’ ’ forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidence</b> {{found in the literature}} relates to these mod-ulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good ex-planations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this re-view is focused. I hypothesize that the life form ‘‘tree’ ’ is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meri-stem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively aects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3 °C and lower than 10 °C, possibly in the 5. 5 – 7. 5 °C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.

40|$|A set of intentioned {{readings}} over Cordoba's ancient landscape, {{reveal the}} occupation logics developed over centuries of territorial construction. These logics {{result from the}} combination of cultural ways of domination and exploitation of the space, the technical resources available and the natural landscape conditions imposed. Models of order emerge from such processes, constituting the synthesis of human work accumulated in time and expressing ways of space organization and a specific way of rurality. The keys for future planning reside in these models. The study area is North of Traslasierra, Córdoba, Argentina, a large territory of more than eleven thousand square kilometers, with an estimate of one hundred small villages and settlements, and a population that is just over thirty thousand people. lt's an area of ancient colonial settlements and important economic weight between the seventeenth and nineleenth centuries when it entered a gradual socioeconomic decline. As a result, today it is a regional space in crisis with a significant delay in terms of territorial policies. Its "traserrana" position and the natural settlement of its valleys and mountains have also been an impediment for its development and have helped {{to set up a}} territorial invisibility box. The general hypothesis of this research is the presumption that the North ofTraslasierra is an undervaluated region -in terms of its cultural attributes - and unknown as representative of the local history. The area counts with numerous highly <b>explanatory</b> <b>evidences</b> of the regional identity and of Cordoba's native culture, offering some keys for the comprehension of the rural highland territories. Other secondary hypotheses hover around the presumption that both the scale of the Latin-American territory and the omnipresence of nature, "minimize" the traces of human work, discussing the notion of "will to project". However, it emerges the suspicion that in non-agrarian rurality (on the European way) it is also possible to discover spatial models of order appropriate to the scale and the vastness, in a way of organization that can be named "rural constellations". Therefore, the study of the production activities on the area (mules, goods, blankets and minerals) and their spatial expression, could allow the comprehension of the conformation of a way of rurality and also offer clues to rethink the future of the region. lt is also maintained that the scale of the area, the vast distances and the low density of material traces, demand the construction of a regional story to study and visualize this postponed highland space. It is intended to create new readings over this landscape of Córdoba in order to define a body of knowledge about it. In that process, the aim is to value its cultural and landscape resources, as a way to recover the regional history and to construct a narrative of the territory. Finally, new inputs of territorial order with a focus set to the material reality of the local spaces are expected to be generated in order to guide the definition of future projects and intentions at the region. The methodology is divided into two procedures: first, selective and intentioned readings of the territorial processes, applying scales which express the actions of spatial definition and using drawing as the main instrument of reading and recording, {{in order to get a}} closer proximity to a tangible reality, secondly, a description and interpretation in the sense that to understand is to interpret, and to interpret is to evidence.

40|$|Preoccupied with measurement, physics has {{neglected}} the need, {{before anything}} can be measured, to recognize {{what it is that}} is to be measured. The recognition of symbols employs a known physical mechanism. The elemental mechanism-a damped inverted pendulum joined by a driven adjustable pendulum (in effect a clock) -both recognizes a binary distinction and records a single bit. Referred to by engineers as a "clocked flip-flop," this paired-pendulum mechanism pervades scientific investigation. It shapes evidence by imposing discrete phases of allowable leeway in clock readings; and it generates a mathematical form of evidence that neither assumes a geometry nor assumes quantum states, and so separates statements of evidence from further assumptions required to explain that evidence, whether the explanations are made in quantum terms or in terms of general relativity. Cleansed of unnecessary assumptions, these expressions of evidence form a platform on which to consider the working together of general relativity and quantum theory as <b>explanatory</b> language for <b>evidence</b> from clock networks, such as the Global Positioning System.

The study was based on the UK Interventional Procedures Programme (IPP).   A multidimensional framework for categorising <b>evidence</b> (<b>explanatory</b> vs. pragmatic) was developed and tested using IPP-evaluated procedures.   A qualitative study explored how local NHS decision-makers respond to IPP guidance and whether additional information might be useful to them.   A range of approaches – from simple descriptive data, through evidence syntheses, to economic models of cost-effectiveness – were explored in a case study of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for snoring. NHS decision-makers’ responses to IPP guidance varied and they indicated additional information would be helpful.   Available evidence on the effects of procedures went beyond ‘efficacy’.   The case study showed it was possible, within limitations, to provide useful additional information but at increasing costs as complexity increased. Decision-makers vary in their responses to IPP guidance.   Additional information (such as prevalence, incidence, costs and likely cost-effectiveness), which they indicated would be useful, is potentially available but the feasibility of providing this varies depending {{on the nature of the}} evidence available and the related costs.   The thesis indicates that the quality of decision-making would be improved if guidance that a new procedure is safe and efficacious were to be contextualised through specific extra information.

40|$|There are few {{opportunities}} {{to evaluate the}} relative importance of landscape structure and dynamics upon biodiversity, especially in highly fragmented tropical landscapes. Conservation strategies and species risk evaluations often rely exclusively on current aspects of landscape structure, although such limited assumptions are known to be misleading when time-lag responses occur. By relating bird functional-group richness to forest patch size and isolation in ten-year intervals (1956, 1965, 1978, 1984, 1993 and 2003), we revealed that birds with different sensitivity to fragmentation display contrasting responses to landscape dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For non-sensitive groups, there was no time-lag in response: the recent degree of isolation best explains their variation in richness, which likely relates to these species' flexibility to adapt to changes in landscape structure. However, for sensitive bird groups, the 1978 patch area was the best <b>explanatory</b> variable, providing <b>evidence</b> for a 25 -year time-lag in response to habitat reduction. Time-lag was more likely in landscapes that encompass large patches, which can support temporarily the presence of some sensitive species, even when habitat cover is relatively low. These landscapes potentially support the most threatened populations and should be priorities for restoration efforts to avoid further species loss. Although time-lags provide an opportunity to counteract the negative consequences of fragmentation, it also reinforces the urgency of restoration actions. Fragmented landscapes will be depleted of biodiversity if landscape structure is only maintained, and not improved. The urgency of restoration action may be even higher in landscapes where habitat loss and fragmentation history is older and where no large fragment remained to act temporarily as a refuge...|$|R
40|$|Background The Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) was {{introduced}} in April 2004. Research to date has primarily looked at its effects on process and surrogate outcomes measured in primary care rather than evidence linked hospital admissions. None has used individual linked data. This study utilises data linkages between the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets to determine the impact of QOF targets on hospital admissions at the individual patient level Methods CHD QOF targets and linked hospital admissions were selected according {{to the strength of}} their evidence base and ease of extraction. Outcomes were ICD 10 codes for Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD). These formed the primary diagnosis over a hospitalisation and depending on the severity of the code, were additionally an emergency admission. Econometric analysis was then undertaken with IHD admissions as the dependent variable and evidence based CHD QOF targets as <b>explanatory</b> variables. Results <b>Evidence</b> based CHD QOF targets were found to significantly reduce outcomes after a one year lag. Of the co-morbidities included, only Heart Failure was consistently found to significantly increase outcomes in all analyses. Higher deprivation, and having a study outcome prior to CHD diagnosis, significantly increased outcomes. Being treated in a higher performing practice on the selected targets, in itself, significantly reduced outcomes. Conclusion This study has demonstrated at the individual level that evidence linked targets in the QOF are effective in reducing linked hospital admissions with a lag. It is the first study to take advantage of CPRD and HES linkages to do so. This has been demonstrated in a ‘real’ world setting, outside of controlled clinical settings, and in so doing addressed deficiencies identified in the existing research.

40|$|Esta tese versa sobre as concepções teóricas acerca da história em alguns textos de crítica literária de Moysés Vellinho e no seu ensaio histórico-sociológico Capitania d´El-rei. O estudo da obra desse escritor, no período entre os anos 1925 e 1964, justifica-se por ter sido o autor muito influente em toda uma geração de historiadores e intelectuais autodidatas que produziam conhecimento histórico no Rio Grande do Sul antes da implantação da pesquisa universitária nessa área. A abordagem adotada focaliza o texto, a construção de sentido na narrativa, o tratamento do evento, da estrutura e da temporalidade, articulando-se esses aspectos com o lugar social de produção do conhecimento histórico. O objetivo mais amplo deste trabalho se insere nas investigações que buscam compreender como os historiadores delimitavam seus objetos de estudo, como acionavam provas documentárias, estratégias explicativas e narrativas. Busca-se contribuir para o exame das condições de produção do conhecimento histórico, afastando-se de uma tradição de análise que esteve em voga nos estudos historiográficos da chamada “historiografia crítica” dos anos 1980, que se voltou quase exclusivamente para as relações entre a ideologia política, a posição de classe social e as teses dos historiadores dessa época. Isso implica estabelecer não apenas o quê, mas também como essa historiografia foi construída, considerando a existência de uma articulação entre epistemologia e constrangimentos disciplinares exercidos por parte da comunidade de historiadores e suas instituições, bem como da sociedade englobante (regional e nacional). This thesis {{approaches}} theoretical {{conceptions of}} history in some texts of literary criticism written by Moysés Vellinho, {{as well as in}} his historical-sociological essay Capitania d’El-rei. The study of the works produced by this writer between 1925 and 1964 is justified by the fact that Vellinho was very influent in a whole generation of self-taught historians and intellectuals who produced historic knowledge in Rio Grande do Sul before the implantation of academic research in this area. The approach adopted focuses on the text, the construction of meaning in narrative, the treatment of the event, the structure and temporality, articulating those aspects with the social place of production of historic knowledge. The widest objective of this work is located in the investigations that have attempted to understand how historians delimitated their objects of study, how they activated documental <b>evidence,</b> <b>explanatory</b> strategies, and narratives. This work aims at contributing towards the examination of the production conditions of historic knowledge, moving away from a tradition of analysis that was predominant in historiographic studies of the so-called “critic historiography” of the 1980 ’s, which devoted itself almost exclusively to the relationships among politic ideology, position of social class, and theses of historians of that time. This implies the establishment of not only what, but also how this historiography was constructed, considering the existence of an articulation between epistemology and disciplinary restrictions exerted by the community of historians and their institutions, as well as by their surrounding society (both regional and national) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} aim of {{the thesis}} is to study which professional arguments various participants in the child welfare area have employed in order to explain, influence and legitimize {{their understanding of the}} phenomenon competence in child welfare. The general theoretical perspective of the thesis is social constructivistic, more exactly theories about discourses and professions. I have been inspired mainly by Michel Foucault (1972), Norman Fairclough (1995) and Andrew Abbott (1988), and central concepts in this thesis are jurisdiction, claimsmaking, power and discourse. Through the perspective of constructivism, this thesis will not focus on what professional competence in child welfare is. The {{aim of the}} thesis is instead to present how the conception of the professional work is created through the language idiom. In order to attain the aim of the thesis, I have analysed texts that, in the period 1992 - 2012, primarily have been found in the periodical Norges Barnevern (Child Welfare in Norway). However, I have also analysed central policy documents, such as for example Reports to the Storting and Norwegian official reports. The thesis has a qualitative design. The research issues focus on the following aspects: Which participants' voices are heard? How do various participants make their voices heard? Which professional conceptions are behind what is said? The results show that there are various professions that claim to have a right to point out the direction as to how competence relative to child welfare may be understood. In other words, it is not reserved for professions with a professional background in social work. With the aid of legal claimsmaking, lawyers are constructed as guarantors of legal protection, and as useful to society. The competence that is referred to is the one that may be governed through rules of law. In addition, the findings show that psychologists make several attempts at creating a role as carriers of knowledge within child welfare. With an emphasis on evidence based knowledge and affiliated research, we see tendencies towards psychologicalization of the work related to child welfare. We also see tendencies to professional antagonism between child welfare officers and social workers, where both professions are made into spokesmen for their own professional territory. The competence which is claimed to strengthen the child welfare's professional legitimacy is mainly connected to <b>evidence</b> based <b>explanatory</b> models. The <b>evidence</b> discourse claims the requirement to reduce the use of professional discretion, and implicitly in these discussions, there are thoughts to the effect that the work related to child welfare is not as complex that it may not, to a certain extent, be standardized. The competence which is attributed value is also linked to requirements for cost efficiency. In this context, the findings indicate that lawyers and psychologists, {{to a greater extent than}} social workers and child welfare officers, fit in, or have adapted to the new administrative models, and to the requirement that complicated assessments within the professional practice, should be replaced by efficiency and evidence based package deals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} momentum {{returns in}} 54 countries covering 34 years. It {{is the first}} study where optimising programmes are applied to momentum returns and portfolio selection. Momentum returns have remained a contentious topic and {{a substantial amount of}} research purports to support and negate this anomaly. Momentum studies have previously concentrated on finding the cause of this anomaly or determining whether abnormal returns are present only in a particular dataset. However, there is no clear consensus regarding how to construct/implement a momentum strategy. To date it has been unclear as to how many portfolios should be created, whether or not the portfolios should be equally-weighted or value-weighted and how the momentum returns will change when a chosen strategy is constructed/implemented compared to an alternative strategy. This lack of precision concerning how to construct/implement momentum strategy potentially leads to confounding results. This current thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} structure impact effect by computing momentum returns for changing portfolio structures and observing the magnitude of the impact on returns on a specially crafted database of 52, 593 stocks from 54 countries over the time period 1973 - 2007. The two important empirical extensions are the industrial momentum and the 52 -week high momentum models. Both the industrial momentum and 52 -week high momentum strategies claim that their returns are superior to the traditional momentum return and possess superior <b>explanatory</b> power. Empirical <b>evidence,</b> to date, has not been available to attest to whether the results hold true when applied in different markets. This gap in knowledge motivated this research investigation of multiple countries addressing how different methods of calculating returns, different approaches to momentum strategy, different portfolio weighting process impact upon the robustness of results. This research also addresses the question of whether momentum returns can be increased through the use of optimisation algorithms. Traditionally, little attention has been paid to the portfolio weighting with either an equal-weighted or value-weighted approach to allocating funds to the Winner and Loser portfolios. This study proposes an alternative way of allocating money to the Winner and Loser portfolios with the goal of generating increased returns. Eight different algorithms are applied to the share returns to determine whether one method is clearly superior to others in maximising the momentum returns for the synthesised portfolios over a period of time. This is the first study of its type where optimising programmes are applied to momentum returns and portfolio selection and covers several countries. The results indicate that momentum returns are robust on a global scale and the returns are by and large statistically significant under different portfolio construction approaches. Both the industrial and 52 -week momentum strategies remain positive and statistically significant but do not generate the same magnitude of returns as the conventional momentum return model. The optimisation of momentum return shows promising results as a number of optimisation techniques do enhance momentum returns. As the potential to increase returns becomes known, traders will quickly react and there is likely to be a range of new investment products arising...|$|R
40|$|Only 20 % of {{patients}} at diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer will {{be suitable for}} potentially curative surgical resection, and then only 5 - 10 % of these will survive to 5 years. Most individuals die within twelve months. Whilst the relief of physical symptoms is essential and contributes to improving quality of life, such patients {{are also likely to}} have psychosocial needs. Psychological adaptation {{has been found to be}} positively influenced by the coping resources available to individuals e. g. physical and emotional well being, their values and beliefs, support from family and their social network. Carers' levels of psychological distress, when cure is no longer an option, can be extremely high. Evaluation and research of the organization of generic palliative care in specialist gastrointestinal cancer is limited. Method An exploratory case study design using contextual triangulation was used. 34 patients receiving generic palliative care for gastrointestinal cancer, 30 main carers and 28 bereaved carers were interviewed and completed measures of psychological wellbeing. Patients also completed the Concerns Checklist. Findings Whilst the main message in the literature had suggested that psychological distress manifested as depression was underestimated in patients with cancer, this study did not support these conclusions. There were however, high levels of anxiety, concerns and adjustment disorder in patients. Fisher's exact test was highly significant (p= 0. 002) for anxiety and poor disclosure in patients. Contributing factors to this are explored. Patient anxiety was significantly correlated with total concerns (r = 0. 419 p=. 017) In carers Fisher's exact test was significant for psychological distress and information (p =. 029) with a trend for younger female carers and bereaved carers to be more anxious than older carers. There was a clear association between insensitive disclosure, unmet information needs, poor coordination of care and increased psychological distress in carers, with unresolved consequences when bereaved. Implications Results demonstrate the need to proactively manage those affected by these cancers of limited prognosis. Individual assessment of patient and carers at an early stage of their referral to a specialist gastrointestinal cancer centre, with particular attention to psychosocial needs, use of sensitive disclosure, tailored information and coordination of care may promote positive appraisal of coping resources, improve adjustment and increase psychological well-being. Conclusion This study has illustrated the wide diversity amongst those affected by incurable gastrointestinal cancer. The perceptions and concerns of 92 people have been listened to, and their levels of psychological well-being measured. It offers new insight in a number of areas and in particular the association of health service care and how this increases or decreases access to coping! improving levels of psychological well being. The current case study using triangulation was able to reveal individual meaning as well as collaborative interpretation of the con~tituents and processes of living, dying, or caring for someone with incurable gastrointestinal cancer. The breadth of such an approach has not been found previously in a British study in gastrointestinal cancer, and this exploratory and <b>explanatory</b> approach provides <b>evidence</b> and a strong new insight into the effects of incurable gastrointestinal cancer upon those affected. Such results hold potential for practical application and key quality issues which address how a specialist gastrointestinal cancer service should develop its standards of care and audit practice. By entering the participant's world, although very briefly, this study has explored the perceptions and concerns of those affected by incurable gastrointestinal cancer, and links with coping and psychological well-being. There is a need to pursue this work with on going study, whilst publishing and promoting evidence of the positive outcomes for all parties involved...|$|R
