40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examine how the}} use of Web 2. 0 tools (such as Wikis, Blogs, Social Networking) might provide a digital {{foundation}} for a Transactive Memory System (TMS). TMS facilitate knowledge sharing and retrieval processes in groups {{by the use of}} a well-maintained <b>knowledge</b> <b>directory.</b> The theory of TMS explains how it is that a group appears to have a "group mind" and research shows that a well functioning TMS improves group performance. Web 2. 0 software embeds data about authors, interested parties and related information into the content created in these tools, constituting essentially a <b>knowledge</b> <b>directory</b> which can be used to locate knowledge seekers or advise them of content they may be interested in. Consequently, the use of Web 2. 0 tools may improve knowledge absorption and utilisation by supporting TMS. This is a conceptual paper, which seeks to provide a link between Web 2. 0 and TMS and, by implication, enhancement in the functioning of groups and organisations. transactive memory systems, TMS, social software, Web 2. 0, collective learning, knowledge sharing, knowledge management...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the idea of {{semantics}} being the studies of meaning {{in relation to the}} world wide web. The first phase involves a detailed analysis of the current situation, where I focused on the already established forms of web page marking with insertion of machine-understandable metadata about their meaning. The second phase is intended to examine the idea of semantic web as a technical solution, towards which today's web should converge. Consequently, I presented {{the differences between the two}} with a concrete example of usage based on the data gathered from various real sources. The domain of this study included searching for people or groups of people at the labour exchange, which includes many web pages that serve as sources of information. The above said concrete example is placed within the project, which at a certain point reveals that in order for it to be finished in time, there are not enough people. Consequently, we need to find more people with suitable knowledge and other desired criteria. The result is a system composed of two major parts. Within the first part, corresponding to the first phase, the subsystem gathers information from different sources by scrapping or separating data from presentation. The second part, as the result of phase two, is presented as a <b>knowledge</b> <b>directory</b> based upon the interconnected ontologies of different sources. On account of my aim – highlighting the differences as much as possible – I have linked the said knowledge database with a web user interface for executing queries...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the use of}} Safety Management Systems {{and procedures}} in high-risk industries is being studied, focusing on the following research questions: 1 : How is Safety Management System defined in the safety literature? 2 : How is Safety Management System used in a petroleum producing company? 3 : How can end user involvement improve the {{development and use of}} procedures and Safety Management System? 4 : What kind of training in the use of procedures and Safety Management System are the workers in two different companies given? How can the training be improved? The empirical data was collected by conducting qualitative in-depth interviews with 27 staff members of two different companies in the Norwegian gas and petroleum producing sector. In this thesis Safety Management Systems are defined as IT-based systems which purpose is to code and share good practices, and to create corporate <b>knowledge</b> <b>directories</b> for the organization. Safety Management Systems and the procedures are here regarded as a form of communication; designed at an executive level in the organization and communicated to the lower levels in the organization`s hierarchy. There is no guarantee that the employees will perceive, understand and interpret the procedures and system as intended by the management. Executives in this study generally regard Safety Management Systems and procedures as important tools for all work, while many of the workers were less enthusiastic. The informants with a good use of the system and the procedures saw them as helpful, {{and as a result of}} industrial experience accumulated over many years. The informants with a poor use of the procedures acknowledged the need for safety measures, but saw their own experience as more important for safety than the Safety Management System. Several of the challenges with using the Safety Management System in the two companies are related to communication and to the organizational context; how the workers relate to computers, information overload, and dealing with highly detailed procedures, the development of informal procedures, the workers ideals of professionalism, and how to ensure a good two-way communication, and staff training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{development}} of a multi agent system working on the Semantic Web environment by using a new framework called SEAGENT. SEAGENT is a new agent development framework and platform, which includes built-in features for semantic web based multi agent system development. These features provide semantic supports such as a new specific content language for transferring semantic knowledge, specifically designed agent’s internal architecture to handle semantic <b>knowledge,</b> a new <b>directory</b> facilitator architecture based on semantic service matching engine and ontology management service to provide ontology translations within the platform’s ontologies. The implemented case study shows the effectiveness of these features in terms of semantically enriched multi agent system development. ...|$|R
40|$|An expert is {{traditionally}} viewed as {{someone with a}} high level of expertise in a particular area. This expertise is reflected in their knowledge, their experience and how they utilise and learn from these aspects when interacting with others and problem solving. However, the concept of ‘Expert’ is also a social label. A member of a social group is given the Expert label if their expertise about a topic is acknowledged to be superior to that of other group members. Therefore, the level of expertise required to be an Expert is dependent on the expertise of the group as a whole. Researchers have developed expertise finding software systems that identify the experts within groups using staff <b>knowledge</b> <b>directories</b> (‘yellow pages’) or simple term-based search engines that examine documents like staff publications. The resulting profiles of people’s expertise are incomplete and vague. These systems do not explore the social dimension of expertise in groups like online communities. This thesis argues that the Duality of Expertise construct consists of a person’s knowledge contributions to their group as a whole and how the group responds to those contributions. More specifically, this research considers the linguistic evidence of such aspects of expertise within online forums. Only public postings within the forum are studied, restricting any measure of expertise to utilising the public interactions within the forum. Various forums are studied. The Expertise Finding Model is presented as a process which deploys the Duality of Expertise in an expertise finding system. It examines the linguistic features of forum postings, utilising existing methodologies from information retrieval and computational linguistics in a novel way. The model’s knowledge component regards each author’s contributions as evidence of their claims at expertise in particular topics, through their use of specialised terms and senses as well as recognising which terms are semantically associated and relate to the same topic. The model’s community component is based on the reply postings each author receives from other community members, using the dialogue acts in these replies to profile the community’s opinions towards the author’s expertise claims. These dialogue acts include positive and negative statements towards the content of the original posting. Thus the Expertise Finding Model relates to expertise claims and community opinions. The model is evaluated through a series of experiments using forum postings from the W 3 C corpus and a test-set from TREC 2006 ’s Enterprise track. Preprocessing extracts the postings and identifies their linguistic features. A modified Indri IR system indexes postings and ranks the corresponding authors according to their expertise claims. The community’s dialogue acts are used to rank authors according to the community’s opinions towards them. Finally, an Areas of Interest → Community Opinion → Expertise Ranking relationship combines the two components to rank the authors’ topic expertise based on both their expertise claims and the community’s opinions. The Duality of Expertise and the Expertise Finding Model contribute new approaches to expertise and expert finding systems. This relationship is also related to dialogue act and dialogic action-reaction theories...|$|R

40|$|Web Service Technology (WST) is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{implementation}} framework that has attracted much attention. With {{the help of}} WST, user finds the required service in the service directories. Current service directories, such as Universal Discovery Description & Integration (UDDI), store service descriptions without any processing and knowledge management. They act as simple stateless search machines and do not use previous matching information to enhance future search. This motivates the need to create the Empower Service Directories (ESD). These directories are augmented with knowledge about web services that is encoded by a Semantic Interlinked Graph (SIG) of WST entities. In the proposed system, the services and their operations are the core entities of SIG and are interlinked using some defined semantic relations. In addition an ontology language is used to formally express <b>knowledge</b> in service <b>directories.</b> Using the SPARQL web services are extracted from the ESD. The major advantage of using the empower service directories service is its supports for highly complex queries which can be processed less time...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} UNESCO, {{which was founded}} in 1945, is to “contribute to the {{building}} of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information. ” An important plank in that mission is a commitment to help build inclusive and equitable knowledge societies. We should not be surprised, therefore, that UNESCO supports the Open Access movement, we should not be surprised that it was the first UN agency to adopt an OA policy, and we should not be surprised that it now makes its own publications Open Access. Today UNESCO’s OA repository (OAR) provides free access to over 500 of its own books, reports and articles in over 11 languages, and in recent years it has created a number of OA portals, <b>directories,</b> <b>knowledge</b> banks and Open Access indicators. In actual fact, argues Indrajit Banerjee, a commitment to both openness and to science has been implicit in everything UNESCO has done since it was founded in 1945. Immediately after the Second World War, for instance, {{it was one of the}} chief architects of th...|$|R
40|$|Social Web {{has moved}} {{knowledge}} production {{from the hands}} of the experts and professionals to the masses. Today online social networking sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr, allow ordinary people not only to create massive quantities of new data, but also organize it, use it, and share it with others. Unlike earlier information technologies, the Social Web exposes social activity, allowing each person to observe and be influenced by the actions of others in real time. How will such real-time, many-to-many communication change how we discover, use, and manage information? And how will it transform society and how we solve problems? My research addresses these questions by developing methods to harvest social knowledge. Consider a gazetteer, for example, Geonames. org, which compiles geospatial <b>knowledge</b> within a <b>directory</b> of places and place names, often organizing it hierarchically within taxonomy of geospatial concepts. Such gazetteers have been useful for creating geo-aware applications and integrating geospatial knowledge. However, since gazetteers are manually and painstakingly created by an expert or a small group of experts, they are rarely complete or comprehensive, do not reflect the variety of views, and fail to keep up with our changing ideas about places...|$|R
