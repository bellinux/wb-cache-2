40|$|Based on {{the account}} of the vital role which the {{national}} finance played in supporting agriculture, the thesis presents the current situation of financial support for agriculture in China, in terms of the limited scale and irrational structure of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture. On the basis of the brief introduction of the current level of Chinese farmers’ income, the thesis discusses the effects of scale and irrational structure of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture on the farmers’ income, according to the related data of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture and rural per capita net income. The results indicate that the calculating regression equation has a remarkable explanation power, reflecting the positive role of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture played by national finance in increasing the farmers’ income. As regards the structure of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture at present, according to the proportion from high to low, the expenditure primarily consists of three parts from high to low in sequence as follows: productive expenditure and funds for public undertakings, capital construction expenditure, and rural relief expenditure plus science and technology funds. Such sequence deviates from the marginal production effects of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture and the correlation of farmers’ income, which demonstrates the severe irrationality of the structure of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward as follows: on one hand, we should continue intensifying the efforts to support agriculture financially in order to form a regular increase mechanism; on the other hand, we should adjust and optimize the structure of financial support <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> agriculture, and further crystallize the investment flows.

5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its <b>expenditures.</b> <b>In</b> other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E
