5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even <b>if</b> <b>they,</b> <b>like</b> Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E

25|$|The {{song was}} written {{considering}} how popular music consumers chose {{to listen to}} music in the early 2010s: by listening to samples on a purchasing page, or to ringtone versions of a song, and from there deciding <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> a song or not. Yamaguchi wanted to create a song that was hard to critically review due to its complexity, and that music consumers could not evaluate listening to a single sample. Yamaguchi wrote a song that was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E

2500|$|Raj did {{not appear}} in the original, unaired series pilot, which only {{featured}} Leonard, Sheldon, and a different version of the Penny character, called Katie. The test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. In the new pilot, Raj and Howard were added. Series co-creator Bill Prady stated: [...] "The idea was, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> these first two guys, let’s give them two more".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|Following the pre-{{audition}}s, acts audition {{in front}} of (as of 2016) four celebrity judges. The judges may end an act's performance early by pressing their red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. If an act receives X's from all judges, they must stop their performance. In addition, large audiences have also been {{a factor in the}} judging process, as their reaction to an act's performance may swing or influence a judge's vote. This makes the audience the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] ("fourth", from seasons 1-4) judge. From seasons 1 to 4, voting worked on a majority-of-two basis where two positive votes were required. Starting from season 5, voting works on a majority-of-three basis as there are four judges. The judging panel give an act a [...] "Yes" [...] <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> them and would like them to advance to the next stage of the competition, and a [...] "No" [...] if they dislike the act and do not wish to see them again.|$|E

5000|$|In a February 2012 {{interview}} by Susan Berfield, Siegel elaborated: [...] "Whenever I saw a negative article about Gore, I {{put it in}} with the paychecks of my 8,000 employees. I had my managers do a survey on every employee. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> Bush, we made them register to vote. But not <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> Gore. The week before election we made 80,000 phone calls through my call center—they were robo-calls. On Election Day, we made sure everyone who was voting for Bush got to the polls. I didn’t know he would win by 527 votes. Afterward, we did a survey among the employees {{to find out who}} voted who wouldn’t have otherwise. One thousand of them said so." ...|$|R
60|$|Man after man capped this brave speech; the minority, who, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> {{little to}} go, liked still less {{to be left}} behind, gave in their consent perforce; and, {{to make a long}} story short, Amyas conquered, and the plan was accepted.|$|R
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "Neither shall he multiply wives to himself" [...] in [...] to limit him {{to no more}} than 18 wives. Judah said that he could have more wives, provided that they did not turn away his heart. But Simeon said that he must not marry even one wife who would turn away his heart. The Mishnah concluded that [...] prohibited the king from marrying more than 18 wives, even if they were all as righteous as Abigail the wife of David.. The Gemara noted that Judah did not always employ the rationale behind a Biblical passage as a basis for limiting its legal effect, as he did here in [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Judah employed the rationale behind the law here because [...] itself expounds the rationale behind its legal constraint: The reason behind the command, [...] "he shall not multiply wives to himself," [...] is so [...] "that his heart be not turned aside." [...] Thus Rabbi Judah reasoned that [...] itself restricts the law to these conditions, and a king could have more wives if [...] "his heart be not turned aside." [...] The Gemara noted that Simeon did not always interpret a Biblical passage strictly by its plain meaning, as he appeared to do here in [...] The Gemara explained that Simeon could have reasoned that [...] adds the words, [...] "that his heart turn not away," [...] to imply that the king must not marry even a single wife who might turn away his heart. And one could interpret the words [...] "he shall not multiply" [...] to mean that the king must not marry many wives even <b>if</b> <b>they,</b> <b>like</b> Abigail, would never turn away his heart. The Gemara then analyzed how the anonymous first view in [...] came to its conclusion that the king could have no more than 18 wives. The Gemara noted that [...] refers to the children of six of David's wives born to David in Hebron. The Gemara reasoned that the prophet Nathan referred to these six wives in [...] when he said, [...] "And if that were too little, then would I add to you the like of these, and the like of these," [...] each [...] "these" [...] implying six more wives. Thus with the original six, these two additions of six would make 18 in all.|$|E

50|$|In {{the time}} of Ancient Greece, people didn't clap. Instead, they stomped for their {{appreciation}} and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> stomped long enough, they would break a leg.
