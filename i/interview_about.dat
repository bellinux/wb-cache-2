5|$|In 2005, De Ravin {{was cast}} to portray Emily Kostich, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in the neo-noir film Brick. In an <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> the film, Ravin {{told that she}} was {{attracted}} by the script because it was original and the teens in the film are very deep and emotional for their age.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|In a {{secondary}} plot, male Sheriff's deputy Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) {{is given a}} promotion over female deputy Maxine Stuart (Lauren Holly) after she is asked in her <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> such things as whether she was planning {{to get married and}} get pregnant in the near future. She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him.|$|E

5|$|In an <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> {{the film}} on his website, Anderson {{discussed}} problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck {{instead of a}} censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an <b>interview.</b> <b>About</b> 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

25|$|Doyle's two volume, The History of Spiritualism was {{published}} in 1926. W. Leslie Curnow a spiritualist, contributed much research to the book. In 1926, Robert John Tillyard wrote a predominantly supportive review of Doyle's book The History of Spiritualism in the journal Nature. This caused controversy, and several critics such as A. A. Campbell Swinton pointed to the evidence of fraud in mediumship and Doyle's non-scientific approach to the subject. In 1927, Doyle spoke in a filmed <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> Sherlock Holmes and spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|In a 1979 <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> general aviation's future {{past the}} year 2000, Weick {{accurately}} envisioned the continued interest in sport aviation and the practical use of aircraft for medium-range transportation. He {{mentioned that he}} had seen gas turbines demonstrated as early as 1922, and that their future use in light aircraft would only be viable with development of cost-efficient materials that could withstand the heat. He felt future aircraft would not be radically different, but could benefit from safety improvements in controllability.|$|E
25|$|The CIA's {{extensive}} file on Cobb {{is estimated}} to include over 2,500 pages.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, many of the documents have been declassified. Some of the Warren Commission's declassified files indicate that the CIA, in the late 1970s, refused to help House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators locate Cobb for an <b>interview</b> <b>about</b> Oswald's activities in Mexico.|$|E
