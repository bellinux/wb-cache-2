Fernando Alonso failed {{to make it into}} Q3, the seventh time that season.

5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of the passive defences.|$|E

The doctor was astounded that Dominguez was still playing football as X-rays and MRI scans revealed that he had three herniated disks and further complications in his spinal canal.

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons.

5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch.

These recommendations were accepted by the Scottish Parliament in the final debate on the bill on 14 June 2006. The bill was carried by 114 votes to one.|$|E

Following an opening ceremony, the Minister and Lord Mayor drove along the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> {{of the road}} from Bristol to inspect the docks at Avonmouth. It was the most {{expensive}} road construction project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now £). Of that, £160,000 (now £) was spent on the cutting at Horsehoe Bend, £80,000 (now £) on the Trym viaduct, and £33,000 (now £) on the steel girder bridge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of the {{clitoris}} was {{alluded to}} by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but {{in such a}} muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured; in 1981, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris. Despite the FFWHC's illustrations, Josephine Lowndes Sevely, in 1987, described the vagina as more of the counterpart of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands. The event spanned August26–31, 2005, with 57tornadoes touching down across 8states. One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage {{for the month}} of August. Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of the hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle of Katrina.|$|E

Two distinct sets of routes for the buses exist—city routes are covered by city buses, while intercity routes are covered by service and express buses. KSRTC operates long distance bus services from Mangalore {{to other parts of the}} state. The other key players who run bus services from Mangalore are the Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators Association (DKBOA) and the Canara Bus Operators Association (CBOA). There are also KSRTC JnNurm green colour city buses from State Bank bus stand. These buses travel to different parts of the city and its suburbs.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 1882, {{the first}} issue of an {{internal}} newspaper of the factory, called, Fabrieksbode ("messenger of the factory"), was published. It was the first magazine of that kind in the world. Agneta helped her husband with other publications, such as his 1881 book, La question Ouvrière à la fabrique de Neerlandaise levure et d'alcool. Essai de solution pratique (The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory. Attempt at a Practical Solution), and another in 1894, L'Organisation Sociale dans l'industrie (The Social System in the Industry), which was printed in two editions and translated into English and German. The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of Matthes' participation is not known, but she was certainly in charge of the translations.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> {{of the original}} gospel is unknown; according {{to a list of}} canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E

5|$|The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of {{occupation}} and {{activity in the}} Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known {{that there was a}} moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Three {{anhydrous}} neptunium oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> of the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen {{has yet to be}} researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E

That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it.
