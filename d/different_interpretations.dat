5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility.

5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about <b>different</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to <b>different</b> <b>interpretations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have <b>different</b> <b>interpretations.</b> The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E
5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have <b>different</b> <b>interpretations,</b> or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E
5|$|The United States House of Representatives voted 236 to 185 {{to repeal}} the Clark Amendment on 11 July 1985. The MPLA {{government}} began attacking UNITA later that month from Luena towards Cazombo along the Benguela Railway in a military operation named Congresso II, taking Cazombo on 18 September. The MPLA government tried unsuccessfully to take UNITA's supply depot in Mavinga from Menongue. While the attack failed, very <b>different</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the attack emerged. UNITA claimed Portuguese-speaking Soviet officers led FAPLA troops while the government said UNITA relied on South African paratroopers to defeat the MPLA attack. The South African government admitted to fighting in the area, but said its troops fought SWAPO militants.|$|E

5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited <b>different</b> <b>interpretations</b> {{of the location}} of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of <b>different</b> <b>interpretations.</b> In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, {{including}} the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary to the impact hypothesis, that the extinction {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, postulating a gradual extinction of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent gradual extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the extinction event was gradual.|$|E
