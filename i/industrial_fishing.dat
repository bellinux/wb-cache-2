25|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{degradation}} and depletion of natural fish stocks in rivers, estuaries, and the oceans (see also Overfishing). Because <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> has become extremely efficient, ocean stocks of large fish, such as tuna, cod, and halibut have declined by 90% in the past 50 years.|$|E
25|$|In former times, {{forage fish}} were more {{difficult}} to fish profitably, and were {{a small part of}} the global marine fisheries. But modern <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> technologies have enabled the removal of increasing quantities. Industrial-scale forage fish fisheries need large scale landings of fish to return profits. They are dominated by a small number of corporate fishing and processing companies.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{has greatly}} {{affected}} many fisheries around the world. As much as 85% of the world's fisheries may be over-exploited, depleted, fully exploited or in recovery from exploitation. Significant overfishing {{has been observed}} in pre-industrial times. In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from {{the earliest days of}} European colonisation of the Americas has been well documented. Following World War Two, <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> rapidly expanded with rapid increases in worldwide fishing catches. However, many fisheries have either collapsed or degraded to a point where increased catches are no longer possible.|$|E

25|$|Spawning {{patterns}} in forage fish are highly predictable. Some fisheries use {{knowledge of these}} patterns to harvest the forage species as they come together to spawn, removing the fish before they have actually spawned. Fishing during spawning periods or at other times when forage fish amass in large numbers {{can also be a}} blow to predators. Many predators, such as whales, tuna and sharks, have evolved to migrate long distances to specific sites for feeding and breeding. Their survival hinges on their finding these forage schools at their feeding grounds. The great ocean predators find that, no matter how they are adapted for speed, size, endurance or stealth, they are on the losing side when faced with the machinery of contemporary <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as artisanal fishing villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned {{to take advantage of}} this. For example, Destin on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become so big that the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power. In 2004 China reported it had 8,048 fishing villages.|$|E
25|$|While {{governments can}} create {{regulations}} to control people's behaviours {{this can be}} undermined by illegal fishing activity. Estimates {{of the size of}} the illegal catch range from 11 to 26 million tonnes, which represents 14-33% of the world's reported catch. Illegal fishing can take many forms. In some developing countries, large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing. It can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing, especially for weak governments. Even in regulated environments, illegal fishing may occur. While <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> is often effectively controlled, smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures. Fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching another. There is also a large problem with surveillance of illegal fishing activity. In 2001, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), passed the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). This is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. It also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal fishing. Some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale with financed commercial operations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> {{companies}} in Chile have reported {{no more than}} 10,000 employees. They own 55 {{percent of the market}} but only four companies own over 92 percent of the market: Marfood, Orizon, Blumar, and Camanchaca. In addition to the clear monopoly of profits, Chile’s new “Fisheries Act” is disproportionately beneficial to large-scale <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> companies. In February 2013, marine resources were privatized for “a period of 20 years, renewable and transferrable,” disproportionately benefiting the big <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> companies. Seven families will profit from the “Longueira Act”, named after the Economy Minister who created it. The beneficiaries are the Angelini, Sarkis, Stengel, Cifuentes, Jiménez, Izquierdo and Cruz families, who will enjoy no less than three million dollars in annual profits. The new legislation amends the scope of the sustainability of hydro-biological resources and access to industrial and artisanal fishing, as well as regulating the investigation and oversight of the industry. It creates 20-year renewable contracts to not only Chilean industrial fisheries but also to foreign companies, primarily from northern Europe and Asia Minor.|$|E
