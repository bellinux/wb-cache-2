5|$|Born in the Adelaide {{suburb of}} Medindie, South Australia, <b>Derrick</b> left {{school at the}} age of {{fourteen}} and found work in a bakery. As the Great Depression grew worse he lost his job and moved to Berri, working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939. In July 1941, <b>Derrick</b> enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, joining the 2/48th Battalion. He was posted to the Middle East, where he took part in the Siege of Tobruk, was recommended for the Military Medal and promoted to corporal. Later, at El Alamein, <b>Derrick</b> was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for knocking out three German machine gun posts, destroying two tanks, and capturing one hundred prisoners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Derrick</b> did {{not join}} up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. <b>Derrick</b> first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. <b>Derrick</b> thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|<b>Derrick</b> then {{returned}} to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for {{an assault on the}} three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, <b>Derrick</b> personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that <b>Derrick</b> personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E

5|$|Disembarking at Port Melbourne in late February 1943, <b>Derrick</b> {{was granted}} a period of leave and {{travelled}} by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl. He rejoined his battalion—now encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide—before they went by train to the Atherton Tableland for training in jungle warfare. Brought up to full strength {{by the end of}} April, the 2/48th Battalion completed its training following landing-craft exercises near Cairns. On 23 July, <b>Derrick</b> was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to his right eye later the same day. After hospital, <b>Derrick</b> returned briefly to Brigade before rejoining the 2/48th Battalion on 27 August.|$|E

5|$|For part of 31 October, <b>Derrick</b> assumed {{command of}} his company after all of the unit's {{officers}} had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, <b>Derrick</b> was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to {{his right hand and}} buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, <b>Derrick</b> attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1944, <b>Derrick</b> {{was posted}} to an officer cadet {{training}} unit in Victoria. He requested {{that he be}} allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion {{at the end of}} the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to <b>Derrick</b> only after much lobbying. While at this unit, <b>Derrick</b> shared a tent with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer.|$|E

5|$|On 7 May 1947, Beryl <b>Derrick</b> {{attended}} an investiture {{ceremony at the}} Government House, Adelaide, where she was presented with her late husband's Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie. Derrick's Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, along with a portrait by Sir Ivor Hele. A street in the neighbouring suburb of Campbell and a rest stop in the Remembrance Driveway between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour. In 1995, a public park was named the <b>Derrick</b> Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St, Glanville in his honour, and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there. In June 2008, a newly built bridge over the Port River on the Port River Expressway was named the Tom 'Diver' <b>Derrick</b> Bridge following a public campaign.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, <b>Derrick</b> led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, <b>Derrick</b> jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, <b>Derrick</b> attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortress}} around Sattelberg was methodically {{reduced by}} intensive Allied bombing which lasted five days, {{coming to an}} end on 23 November. The same day, Japanese aircraft also undertook ground support operations with a force of 44Japanese aircraft attacking Australian positions round Jivevaneng. This did not change the situation around Sattelberg as by then the Australians had reached its southern slopes and the following day they began probing forward towards its summit. Throughout the day they launched a number of attacks, but heavy defensive fire pushed these back until a platoon under the command of Sergeant Tom <b>Derrick</b> fought its way almost to the top, with <b>Derrick</b> leading the way, destroying 10Japanese positions with grenades as he went. With the Australians having secured a toehold just below the summit for the night, the Japanese withdrew under the cover of darkness and the following morning the advance to the mission was completed. For his feat, <b>Derrick</b> later received the Victoria Cross, his nation's highest military decoration.|$|E
5|$|When {{stretcher}} bearers {{reached the}} position at dawn, <b>Derrick</b> {{insisted that the}} other wounded be attended to first. <b>Derrick</b> was carried off Freda later that morning, where he was met by the 26th Brigade's commander, Brigadier David Whitehead. The two men briefly conversed before <b>Derrick</b> excused himself, fearing {{that he had not}} much time left and wishing to see the padre. Stepping back, Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson. At the hospital, surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick's liver; he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds. He was buried in the 2/48th Battalion's cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon, and later re-interred at the Labuan War Cemetery, plot 24, row A, grave 9.|$|E
