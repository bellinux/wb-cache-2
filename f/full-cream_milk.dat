50|$|Bournvita, {{previously}} called Bourn-vita, is a {{brand of}} malted and chocolate malt drink mixes sold in Europe and North America, as well as India, Nepal, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Benin and Togo, and manufactured by Cadbury. Bournvita was developed in England in the late 1920s and was marketed as a health food. The original recipe included <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> fresh eggs, malt and chocolate. It was first manufactured and sold in Australia in 1933. Bournvita was discontinued in the UK market in 2008. The drink was named by Cadbury which was derived from Bournville, the model village which {{is the site of}} the Cadbury factory (Bourn + Vita). It was first sold in India in 1948, the same year Cadbury India was established.|$|E

Raw <b>milk</b> and <b>full-cream</b> UHT <b>milk</b> did not differ for human-like leptin. Leptin content of <b>full-cream</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> was not different to that of <b>full-cream</b> UHT <b>milk,</b> but it was 14 % lower (p < 0. 05) than that observed in raw milk. Human-like leptin level of semi-skimmed UHT milk was not different to that of semi-skimmed pasteurized milk, but it was 30 % lower (p < 0. 0001) than those of full-cream UHT and <b>full-cream</b> pasteurized <b>milks.</b> In skimmed UHT milk, leptin was 40 % lower (p < 0. 0001) than in <b>full-cream</b> UHT <b>milk.</b> Leptin was correlated (p < 0. 001) with lipid content.

50|$|For its {{production}} <b>full-cream</b> pasteurized <b>milk</b> is used. Its coagulation, at 36 C, lasts 30 minutes, then the curd is twice chopped in extremely little fragments. Finally, the bulk mass is put for 8-16 {{hours in a}} damp location. The aging lasts either 3-5 months (in this case the product has an aromatic and fragrant flavour), or 8-12 months. There are rare truckles aged up to 36 months. Sometimes the crust is flavoured with marcs.The truckle has a parallelepiped shape with a plain squared side 11/13 cm or 17/19 cm long and a straight bowed side from 9 to 15 cm. The average weight spaces from 1.3 to 5 kg. The crust is washed with water and salt, while as concerns cheese aged for a longer time it is oiled. In the past, linseed oil was used. In this way, some yellow mildew is built up, which penetrating into the crust increase the flavour.On 21 November 2002, the consortium for the safeguard of the Salva Cremasco was set up, and then this kind of cheese was qualified as PDO, due to its typicalness and well proved productive tradition. The cheese is identified, apart from its cubic or parallelepiped shape, due to its typical brand with capital letters S C on its face.|$|R

50|$|Week 10 - New Zealand Super Challenge - This challenge, set {{along the}} Waikato River, {{would result in}} one {{contestant}} being eliminated. The super challenge would begin with a 4 km mountain bike race, ending at the Huka Falls. The next leg of the race would be 3 km on foot following the Waikato River. The contestants would then be faced with {{a fork in the}} road, where they would have to choose to either take the stairs down to the river, or bungy jump 47m. Before they could take the stairs, they would have to wait for a 30-minute penalty, but they could bungy jump immediately. This was their chance to put into practice what they had learnt earlier in the week about facing their fears. Once down at the river through either method, they would have to kayak for 1.5 km. From there, it was a 100m sprint to the finish line. At the finish line was one last challenge: there would be six food items, and the contestants would have to choose one when they arrive. Whoever had the item with the most calories would lose the challenge and be eliminated. When the bike leg started, Sean took off ahead, followed by Meaghan, Cameron, Tiffany, Sammy and then Julie in last place. Tiffany overtook Cameron during the bike leg, and later Cameron fell off his bike a couple of times. On the running leg, Sammy and later Julie overtook Cameron. Sean arrived at the fork in the road, and decided to bungy jump. Meaghan arrived at the fork and saw Sean bungy jump. Tiffany arrived at the fork while Meaghan was waiting, and bungy jumped ahead of her. Sammy arrived at the fork, and, to try to encourage Meaghan to jump, agreed to jump in tandem with her. However, Meaghan couldn't make herself jump, delaying both herself and Sammy. While she was hesitating, Julie and Cameron arrived and waited out their 30 minutes to take the stairs. Eventually, Meaghan pulled out of the bungy jump and took the stairs while Sammy jumped alone. Sean arrived at the finish line first and chose the Weet-Bix with skim milk as his food item. Tiffany arrived second and chose 125g of blueberries. Julie arrived in third place and chose 43g of potato chips. Cameron's kayak capsized but he still arrived at the finish line in fourth place and chose the ham, cheese and tomato sandwich. Meaghan felt guilty about delaying Sammy because of her own fears, and wanted to sacrifice herself for Sammy, choosing a worse food option than Sammy to protect her. However, they had difficulty deciding between the two options: 200g of spam or 1/2 a litre of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk.</b> Eventually, Sammy chose the milk and Meaghan chose the spam. Finally, Ajay revealed the results. In order from lowest to highest calories, the food items were: 125g of blueberries (Tiffany, 71 calories); Weet-Bix with skim milk (Sean, 194 calories); 43g of potato chips (Julie, 232 calories); ham, cheese and tomato sandwich (Cameron, 285 calories); 1/2 a litre of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> (Sammy, 315 calories); 200g of spam (Meaghan, 616 calories). Meaghan was eliminated, but before she left she had to pass on the Nothing bracelet to another contestant. At this point in the game, the bracelet didn't offer much protection anymore, and none of the contestants minded having it as they weren't in the game for the money. Meaghan decided to give the bracelet to Cameron, as she felt that if one of the other contestants were to win, they would need the money more. Meaghan then left straightaway, taken away by helicopter.|$|E

40|$|Obesity {{is a major}} {{burden on}} {{healthcare}} systems. Simple, cost effective interventions that encourage healthier behaviours are required. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a salience nudge for promoting a change in milk selection from full-cream to low-fat (lower calorie) {{in the kitchen of}} a university-based research institute that provided full-cream and low-fat milk free of charge. Milk selection was recorded for 12 weeks (baseline). A sign with the message “Pick me! I am low calorie” was then placed on the low-fat milk and consumption was recorded for a further 12 weeks. During baseline, selection of low-fat milk was greater than selection of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> (p = 0. 001) with no significant milk-type × time interaction (p = 0. 12). During the intervention period overall milk selection was not different from baseline (p = 0. 22), with low-fat milk consumption remaining greater than <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> selection (p < 0. 001) and no significant milk-type × time interaction (p = 0. 41). However, sub-analysis of {{the first two weeks of}} the intervention period indicated an increase in selection of both milk types (p = 0. 03), but with a greater increase in low-fat milk selection (p = 0. 01, milk-type × time interaction). However, milk selection then returned towards baseline during the rest of the intervention period. Thus, in the present setting, salience nudging promoted a transient increase in low-fat milk consumption, but also increased selection of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> indicating that nudging was not effective in promoting healthier milk choices...|$|E
40|$|Foaming is an {{important}} process {{in the production of}} many food products. It usually involves mechanical agitation or gas injection. Foaming of milk for making cappuccino coffee, a common practice in many countries, involves the injection of steam into cold milk until the temperature reaches ∼ 65 °C. However, it is also possible to foam milk at this temperature using mechanical agitation or air bubbling. The objective of this research was to compare mechanical agitation, steam injection and air bubbling for foaming different types of milk. Five types of milk were chosen, namely reconstituted skim milk, pasteurized skim milk, pasteurized homogenized <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> UHT skim milk and UHT <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk.</b> Foaming characteristics were assessed in terms of foam stability and foam strength. There was little difference in the stability of the foams produced by the three methods of foaming but steam injection produced significantly stronger foams compared to air bubbling while the effect of mechanical agitation relative to steam and air bubbling varied considerably between milk types. Overall, foams with greater stability and strength were produced from the skim milks than from full-cream milks with the difference being most pronounced when mechanical agitation was used.

40|$|Background Lactose {{intolerance}} is {{the most}} common disorder of intestinal carbohydrate digestion. Probiotic that contains the cor- rect strain in appropriate amount can be used as an alternative dietary for lactose intolerance patients. Objective This study was designed to describe the role of probiotic in relieving lactose intolerance symptoms in children consumed <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk.</b> Methods This study was a clinical trial. Inclusion criteria was chil- dren aged 12 - 14 years old, had a good nutrition and health status, with positive breath hydrogen test (BHT) result and lactose intoler- ance symptom(s), and their parents gave consent. Forty-two chil- dren were included. All subjects consumed one glass (200 ml) of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> twice a day for 21 days and recorded intolerance symptoms. Probiotic was added from 8 th to 21 st day in their milk, and responses of treatment were evaluated by scoring system (based on borborigmic, flatulence, abdominal bloating, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea symptoms). At the end of study they were undergone second BHT examination. Results There were decreasing mean score rates at 7 th day (pre) 13. 8 (SD 5. 5) compared with 7. 5 (SD 3. 5) at 14 th day (after) and was statistically significant (P< 0. 001). Mean score rate at 7 th day (pre) 13. 8 (SD 5. 5) compared with 21 st day (after) was 0. 119 (SD 0. 55) and was statistically significant (P< 0. 001). At the end of study, only 2 subjects showed clinical signs of lactose intolerance. Thirty- six subjects had normal BHT result at 21 st day and was statisti- cally significant (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Young (18 - 22 years) and middle-aged (45 - 49 years) {{women living}} in {{urban and rural areas}} of New South Wales {{completed}} a brief food frequency questionnaire as part of a wider health survey. Urban women in both age groups consumed meat less frequently than women in rural areas; and women in the less populated rural areas were more likely to eat green and yellow vegetables and least likely to eat dried beans. There were few other geographic differences in food habits. Middle-aged women consumed reduced-fat milk, fruit, vegetables, fish, biscuits and cakes significantly more frequently, and rice, pasta, <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> fried food and take-away food less frequently than younger women. Smokers in both age groups consumed fresh fruit, vegetables and breakfast cereals significantly less frequently than non-smokers, and women with low levels of habitual physical activity consumed fresh fruit and cereals less frequently than more active women.

40|$|The {{transition}} to a more westernized diets, became evident in the macronutrient intake of women in this study. The consumption of an energy-dense and diverse diet, typical of this transition, contributed to the high mean total energy and protein intakes. High mean total carbohydrate intakes, a staple diet of cereals and grains was also reported. The adequate intake of dietary fibre by the population group {{in this study was}} in contrast with international studies that reported that westernization leads to increased consumption of fibre-depleted carbohydrates. The high total fat intake observed in this study may be ascribed to the increasing preference for cheaper red meat, offal, eggs, <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> cheese, brick margarine and meat drippings used in food preparation. The inclusion of these foods in the diet could explain the high total cholesterol intake reported in this study. Although the food trends of the studied group of women tended to move towards a more westernized style, traditional foods have not been totally eliminated. It is thus clear that urbanisation in this study group has led to high consumption rates of carbonated drinks, cold drinks, coffee, tea and commercial beer. A cereal-based diet was still taken; unfortunately, many of these foods were consumed in the refined form...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{assess the}} {{dynamics}} of plasmid transfer between Bacillus thuringiensis and B. cereus in various food microcosms using the B. thuringiensis pAW 63 and Staphylococcus aureus pUB 110 plasmids as models. Methods and Results: The conjugative behaviour of pAW 63, which resembles the B. anthracis virulence plasmid pXO 2, and the mobilization of pUB 110 were investigated using kinetics studies performed in reference LB (lysogeny broth) medium, full-cream and skimmed milks, soya milk and rice milk. Transfers of pAW 63 and pUB 110 were found {{to occur in the}} five tested media, with higher frequencies observed in food matrices, most notably in <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> skimmed milk and soya milk, where the mean transfer frequencies reached 10 (- 3) transconjugants per recipient cell. The most notable observations were that the higher transfer frequencies obtained in foodstuffs compared to those observed in LB were because of an earlier onset of conjugation in combination with a higher transfer rate and/or a longer mating period. Conclusion: These results indicate that not only the potential for plasmid transfer but also the overall timing of conjugation is affected by each of these food matrices. Significance and Impact of the Study: This new approach to study plasmid transfer provides insights for a better understanding of conjugation in food microcosms from both animal and vegetable origins among members of the B. cereus group...|$|E

Currently there is a paucity of longitudinal consumption data on beverage consumption in Australian children. Subjects/methods: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children has run biennially since 2004. Twenty four-hour recall data collected over 6 waves from the birth cohort (aged 0 – 1 year at baseline) was analysed and demographics were assessed for associations. Results: Five thousand one hundred and seven children participated at baseline, with a 71 – 90 % retention of participants at each wave. Water consumption remained consistent with age over time, with more than 90 % consuming more than one glass in the last 24 -h. Proportions of fruit juice consumers decreased overall. Soft drink and cordial consumer proportions increased from 1 % (0 – 1 year), to 28 % (2 years) and 43 % (10 years).

Conclusions: Water consumption remained consistently high across the ages, while fruit juice was commonly introduced into the diet early childhood. While proportions of fruit juice consumers decreased after the age of 2 years, proportions of soft drink consumers increased. The findings from this study should assist with surveillance data and inform policy and interventions aimed at reducing consumption of sweet beverages...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The authors {{investigated}} the associations {{of medical and}} lifestyle factors with {{the mental health of}} men in their 80 s. Methods: This was a prospective study of a community-representative cohort of older men. Successful mental health aging was defined as reaching age 80 years with Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) of 24 or more and Geriatric Depression Scale- 15 items (GDS- 15) score of 5 or less. Results: Of 601 men followed for 4. 8 years, 76. 0 % enjoyed successful mental health aging. Successful mental health aging was inversely associated with age (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 87; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 81 - 0. 94), non-English-speaking background (HR = 0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 21 - 0. 85), and the consumption of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> (HR = 0. 63; 95 % CI: 0. 45 - 0. 89), and directly associated with high school or university education (HR = 1. 92; 95 % CI: 1. 34 - 2. 75) and vigorous (HR = 1. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 17 - 3. 05) and nonvigorous physical activity (HR = 1. 50; 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 2. 14). Marital status, smoking and alcohol use, weekly consumption of meat or fish, and a medical history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were not associated with mental health outcomes in men aged 80 years or over. Conclusion: Three in four men who reach age 80 years undergo successful mental health aging. Factors associated with successful mental health aging include education and lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity. Lifestyle modification by means of increasing physical activity and reducing saturated fat intake may prove to be a safe, inexpensive, and readily available strategy to help maximize the successful mental health aging of the population...|$|E

Successful mental health aging was inversely associated with age (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 87; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 81 - 0. 94), non-English-speaking background (HR = 0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 21 - 0. 85), and the consumption of <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> (HR = 0. 63; 95 % CI: 0. 45 - 0. 89), and directly associated with high school or university education (HR = 1. 92; 95 % CI: 1. 34 - 2. 75) and vigorous (HR = 1. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 17 - 3. 05) and nonvigorous physical activity (HR = 1. 50; 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 2. 14). Marital status, smoking and alcohol use, weekly consumption of meat or fish, and a medical history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were not associated with mental health outcomes in men aged 80 years or over. CONCLUSION: Three in four men who reach age 80 years undergo successful mental health aging. Factors associated with successful mental health aging include education and lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity. Lifestyle modification by means of increasing physical activity and reducing saturated fat intake may prove to be a safe, inexpensive, and readily available strategy to help maximize the successful mental health aging of the population...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{associations}} between financial, physical and transport conditions that may restrict food access (which we define as food security indicators) and {{the purchase of}} fast foods and nutritious staples such as bread and milk. DESIGN: Multilevel logistic and multinomial regression analysis of cross-sectional survey data to assess associations between the three indicators of food insecurity and household food shopping adjusted for sociodemographic and socio-economic variables. SETTING: Random selection of households (n 3995) from fifty Census Collector Districts in Melbourne, Australia, in 2003. SUBJECTS: The main food shoppers in each household (n 2564). RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, analysis showed that a greater likelihood of purchasing chain-brand fast food {{on a weekly basis}} compared with never was associated with running out of money to buy food (OR = 1 · 59; 95 % CI 1 · 08, 2 · 34) and reporting difficulties lifting groceries (OR = 1 · 77; 95 % CI 1 · 23, 2 · 54). Respondents without regular access to a car to do food shopping were less likely to purchase bread types considered more nutritious than white bread (OR = 0 · 75; 95 % CI 0 · 59, 0 · 95) and milk types considered more nutritious than <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> (OR = 0 · 62; 95 % CI 0 · 47, 0 · 81). The food insecurity indicators were not associated with the purchasing of fruits, vegetables or non-chain fast food. CONCLUSIONS: Householders experiencing financial and physical barriers were more likely to frequently purchase chain fast foods while limited access to a car resulted in a lower likelihood that the nutritious options were purchased for two core food items (bread and milk). Policies and interventions that improve financial access to food and lessen the effect of physical limitations to carrying groceries may reduce the purchasing of fast foods. Further research is required on food sourcing and dietary quality among those with food access restrictions...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{discover}} the cooking habits of school students’ {{families and the}} full nutritional picture of the school population of Huercal de Almería. To gather the views and attitudes of school students and mothers on the low amount of milk and vegetables consumed. DesignCrossover, descriptive and technical study with focus group. SettingRural area. MethodsThe study had three stages: 1. A questionnaire for all the school students on their food habits (675). 2. A sample of 101 students aged between 4 and 6 and between 10 and 14 was chosen for the nutritional study. Students at nutritional risk in 1996 (95 % CI; p. q = 0. 25). Intake was analysed through the «memory of 24 hours», measurement of physical details and biochemical determinations. 3. We gathered views and attitudes by the focus group technique in 1997, with 60 girls between 10 and 14 and mothers in 6 groups. Main resultsHabits: the most commonly eaten meat was chicken, followed by pork, stewed if possible. Blue and fried fish, <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> white bread, fresh green vegetables and olive oil. Nutritional study: the students’ weight and height were above average. Denutrition was rare: we found three students with a percentile less than three. There was tendency to overweight in both sexes, with cholesterol levels above 200 mgr in the 4 - 6 group. Hyper-protein and hyper-fatty diet. The Ca/P quotient was P < 1, especially in the 10 - 14 girls. Consumption of pulses, fibre, cereals and root vegetables was less than the recommended amounts. Micronutrients were sufficient except for less iron in 10 to 14 girls. Focal groups: the four groups of girls coincided in rejection of green vegetables, repeating to some extent habits acquired in their families. Usually vegetables are rejected without having been tried, due to smell, texture and look. Positive knowledge about milk and vegetables was not shown in practice. ConclusionsHyper-protein and hyper-fat diet with high cholesterol levels, weight and height above the average and tendency to overweight. They all rejected green vegetables. They repeated family eating habits...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} composite osmotic distillation (OD) membrane consisting of a thin hydrogel coating on a microporous hydrophobic substrate for the concentration of aqueous feeds containing surface-active agents. The range of OD applications using the hydrophobic membrane alone have been severely limited by the propensity for membrane wet-out when contacted by amphiphilic agents such as oils, fats and detergents. Wet-out allows the feed solution to track freely through the membrane pores with a resulting loss of solutes {{and a decrease in}} selectivity. The rationale for the approach taken was based on the hypothesis that the high water selectivity of the hydrophilic coating would maintain good water mass transfer to the underlying hydrophobic substrate but exclude other components including surface-active agents. The first stage of this work involved the identification of potential coating materials and the fabrication and structural characterization of films of these materials to determine their suitability. The second stage involved the development of techniques to facilitate adhesion of the hydrophilic coatings to the hydrophobic substrate, and the testing of the resulting composite membranes for OD performance and resistance to wet-out by surface-active agents. Sodium alginate was selected as the major coating component {{on the basis of its}} non-toxicity and its potential for stable hydrogel formation. Structural characterization of noncrosslinked films and films crosslinked using a water-soluble carbodiimide (WSC) was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and swelling measurements. Maximum crosslinking through esterification of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on adjacent polymer strands using the film immersion method was achieved with a non-solvent (ethanol) concentration of 60 vol % and a WSC concentration of 100 mM at pH 4. These conditions resulted in a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 60 wt %. DSC measurements of noncrosslinked and crosslinked alginate films showed an increase in crystallinity and hence rigidity on crosslinking. Therefore, several coatings were prepared as blends of sodium alginate and amorphous highly flexible carrageenan gum in order to meet the flexibility requirements of a membrane subjected to varying operating pressures in an industrial OD plant. Structural characterization with respect to polymer blend ratio was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimisation for crosslinking conditions was undertaken as for sodium alginate alone. Optimum conditions for film preparation were 20 wt % carrageenan content and a crosslinking medium containing 60 vol % non-solvent (ethanol) and 120 mM WSC at pH 4. These conditions produced a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 85 wt %. Two different techniques were employed to anchor the coatings on substrate PTFE membranes. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 2 µm, the technique involved surface tension adjustment of the coating solution by ethanol addition in order to enhance penetration of the coating solution meniscus into the substrate pores. This was followed by polymer precipitation by the selective removal of water using OD to provide structural interlocking. T-peel strength measurements showed that this technique resulted in a ten-fold increase in adhesion strength when compared with a coating cast without surface tension adjustments. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 1 µm, an interfacial bonding agent, myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTMA), was used. This technique gave a three-fold increase in adhesion strength relative to that of coating cast without the use of MTMA. The composite membranes were tested in extended OD trials using pure water and feeds containing limonene, the major surface-active components of orange oil. The sodium alginate-carrageenan blend membrane, which was the preferred membrane based on flexibility and water sorption considerations, was also tested against <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> and an industrial detergent, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS). The results indicated that the coatings offered little resistance to water transport and were effective in providing protection against membrane wet-out. Durability trials showed that the composite membranes retained their integrity in water for a minimum of 30 days. Overall, this study has expanded the potential applications of OD to include many important industrial concentration steps that are currently being undertaken by conventional processes with unsatisfactory results. These include the concentration of citrus juices, <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk</b> and nuclear power plant liquid waste. These feeds contain limonene, fats and detergents respectively, all of which wet out unprotected hydrophobic membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} {{to adapt to}} new environments results from the acquisition of new genetic material through Horizontal Gene Transfer. Conjugation is an efficient mechanism of such transfer, which has profound evolutionary implications. Unlike Gram-negative bacteria, the conjugation machinery is not well known in Gram-positive bacteria. pAW 63, originating from Bacillus thuringiensis sv. kurstaki, {{was used in this}} study as a plasmid model to gather more insights into the conjugation mechanisms in the B. cereus s. l. group. Relaxase and origin of transfer (oriT) were previously demonstrated to be essential to plasmid transfer. The first part of this thesis consisted in the preliminary characterization of these components of the pAW 63 plasmid. The putative protein encoded by pAW 63 ORF 76 displayed the three conserved motifs (I to III) of the DNA relaxases of mobile plasmids. In addition, sequence comparison of the pXO 2 -like plasmids and pHTbeta suggested the non-coding region (277 bp) between ORF 2 and ORF 3 as the best candidate for the pAW 63 oriT region. Results of cloning and mutagenesis experiments lent further support to these hypotheses. B. cereus s. l. is an ubiquitous group of bacteria which may develop under a large set of ecological conditions. The complementary approaches of this thesis consisted {{in the study of the}} conjugative behavior of pAW 63 under various stress conditions. First, several food matrices were tested and the transfer of pAW 63 was found to occur with higher frequencies in <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> skimmed milk and soya milk, where the mean transfer frequencies reached 10 - 3 transconjugants per recipient cell. Transfer of pAW 63 was also assessed in salt stress conditions and higher transfer frequencies were observed when bacteria were exposed to a severe salt stress (5 % NaCl). An earlier onset of conjugation in combination with a higher transfer rate and/or a longer mating period were demonstrated by kinetics study. Finally, the conjugative behavior of pAW 63 was also assessed in simulated microgravity, a more unusual stressful condition. Conjugation in Earth-based facilities revealed no significant difference in the pAW 63 transfer frequencies between the three different simulated microgravitational conditions tested and the standard laboratory conditions.

40|$|Foaming can be {{beneficial}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming of milk is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65  70 °C. Foaming of milk is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5 °C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns of milk and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5  85 °C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming of milk depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties of milk as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties of milk proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties of milk per se. Foaming properties of milk over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range of milks which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised <b>full-cream</b> <b>milk,</b> UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5  85 °C). The foaming properties of a given milk were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C when foamed over a temperature range of 5  85 °C. Image analysis of skim milk foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface of skim milk foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5 °C and least rapidly in those produced at 45 °C. The foaming properties of full-cream milks were largely determined by the physical state of milk fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability of full-cream milks when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i. e. in the temperature range 5  40 °C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability of reconstituted milks at lower temperatures (< 45 °C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern of the parent milk as a function of temperature (5  85 °C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase of milk could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45 °C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation of collapsed skim milk foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability of skim milk foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content of milk, decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content of milk, increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability of skim milk foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation of skim milk foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation of skim milk foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content of milk had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties of milk, with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability of milk. However, natural variations in other surface active components of milk such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value of milk and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value of milk below which foaming properties of milk were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content of milk decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the airserum interface of milk foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability of milk, due to an increase in viscosity of the milk. Emulsification of oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability of milk. The foaming patterns of milks containing oil instead of milk fat resembled that of skim milk with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0 °C are not detrimental to the foaming properties of milk foamed in the temperature range 5  85 °C. The higher foam stability of milks containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity of milk as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment of milk to temperatures G 65 °C altered the foaming properties of milk. The foamability of milk increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85 °C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content of milk, by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability of milk subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior of milk, which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution of milk proteins, and the nature of other components of milk such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation of milk foams and the effect of the physical state of milk fat on the foaming properties of milk, achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior of milk, especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties...|$|E
