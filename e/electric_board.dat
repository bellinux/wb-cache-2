25|$|Eugene is {{the home}} of Oregon's largest {{publicly}} owned water and power utility, the Eugene Water & <b>Electric</b> <b>Board</b> (EWEB). EWEB got its start {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century, after an epidemic of typhoid found in the groundwater supply. The City of Eugene condemned Eugene's private water utility and began treating river water (first the Willamette; later the McKenzie) for domestic use. EWEB got into the electric business when power was needed for the water pumps. Excess electricity generated by the EWEB's hydropower plants was used for street lighting.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949 the Province {{set up a}} new utility, the Manitoba Hydro <b>Electric</b> <b>Board</b> (MHEB). In 1953 the MHEB {{acquired}} the assets of the Winnipeg Electric Street Railway.

2500|$|The Manitoba Power Commission and Manitoba Hydro <b>Electric</b> <b>Board</b> merged in 1961 to form Manitoba Hydro. One of {{the earlier}} {{wholesale}} accounts {{to be transferred to}} Manitoba Hydro in 1956 was the village of Emerson, which had been served up to that point by a cross-border tie to the Otter Tail Power system at Noyes. The last of the private mine-owned utility systems at Flin Flon was purchased by Manitoba Hydro in 1973. [...] The early 1970s also marked the installation of tie lines between Manitoba Hydro and utilities in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Minnesota. The interconnection with the American utilities (Otter Tail Power, Northern States Power, and Minkota Power Cooperative) were used to obtain firm power of 90 MW for the winter of 1970; and since that time these interconnections have also been used for export of energy.|$|E

Their {{influence on the}} protection properties of plasma polymer coatings against corrosive environments were examined via an electrochemical test for the visualization of defects in the plasma polymer coating. The defect density could be significantly reduced by the pre-treatment with nitrogen-hydrogen plasma.
