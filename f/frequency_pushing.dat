40|$|International audienceThree optimum {{conditions}} for the tuning of NMR probes are compared: the conventional tuning optimum, {{which is based on}} radio-frequency pulse efficiency, the spin noise tuning optimum based on the line shape of the spin noise signal, and the newly introduced frequency shift tuning optimum, which minimizes the <b>frequency</b> <b>pushing</b> effect on strong signals. The latter results if the radiation damping feedback field is not in perfect quadrature to the precessing magnetization. According to the conventional RLC (resistor–inductor–capacitor) resonant circuit model, the optima should be identical, but significant deviations are found experimentally at low temperatures, in particular on cryogenically cooled probes. The existence of different optima with respect to <b>frequency</b> <b>pushing</b> and spin noise line shape has important consequences on the nonlinearity of spin dynamics at high polarization levels and the implementation of experiments on cold probes...|$|E

Preliminary {{outcomes}} of the SmartWheel Users' Group database: a proposed framework for clinicians to objectively evaluate manual wheelchair propulsion. Objectives: To describe a standard clinical protocol for the objective assessment of manual wheelchair propulsion; to establish preliminary values for temporal and kinetic parameters derived from the protocol; and to develop graphical references and a proposed application process for use by clinicians. Design: Case series. Setting: Six research institutions that collect kinetic wheelchair propulsion data and contribute that data to an international data pool. Participants: Subjects {{with spinal cord injury}} (N= 128). Interventions: Subjects propelled a wheelchair from a stationary position to a self-selected velocity across a hard tile surface, a low pile carpet, and up an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramp. Unilateral kinetic data were obtained from subjects using a force and moment sensing pushrim. Main Outcome Measures: Differences in self-selected velocity, peak resultant force, <b>push</b> <b>frequency,</b> and stroke length across all surfaces, relationship between (1) weight-normalized peak resultant force and self-selected velocity and (2) <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> and self-selected velocity. Results: Graphical references were generated for potential clinical use based on the relation between body weight-normalized peak resultant force, <b>push</b> <b>frequency,</b> and velocity. Self-selected velocity decreased (ramp carpet > tile), and <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> and stroke length remained unchanged when compared across the different surfaces. Weight-normalized peak resultant force {{was a significant predictor of}} velocity on tile and ramp. <b>Push</b> <b>frequency</b> was a significant predictor of velocity on tile, carpet, and ramp.

40|$|We {{describe}} an undergraduate laboratory that combines an accurate {{measurement of the}} speed of light, a fundamental investigation of a basic laser system, and a nontrivial use of statistical analysis. Students grapple with the existence of longitudinal modes in a laser cavity as they change the cavity length of an adjustable-cavity HeNe laser and tune the cavity to produce lasing in the TEM_ 00 mode. For appropriate laser cavity lengths, the laser gain curve of a HeNe laser allows simultaneous operation of multiple longitudinal modes. The difference frequency between the modes is measured using a self-heterodyne detection with a diode photodetector and a radio frequency spectrum analyzer. Asymmetric effects due to <b>frequency</b> <b>pushing</b> and frequency pulling, as well as transverse modes, are minimized by simultaneously monitoring and adjusting the mode structure as viewed with a Fabry-Perot interferometer. The frequency spacing of longitudinal modes is proportional to the inverse of the cavity length with a proportionality constant equal to half the speed of light. By changing the length of the cavity, without changing the path length within the HeNe gas, the speed of light in air can be measured to be (2. 9972 ± 0. 0002) × 10 ^ 8 m/s, which is to high enough precision to distinguish between the speed of light in air and that in a vacuum.

40|$|Wireless {{communications}} {{are showing}} an explosive growth in emerging consumer and military applications of radiofrequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter-wave circuits and systems. Applications include wireless personal connectivity (Bluetooth), wireless local area networks (WLAN), mobile communication systems (GSM, GPRS, UMTS, CDMA), satellite communications and automotive electronics. Future {{cell phones and}} ground communication systems as well as communication satellites will require more and more sophisticated technologies. The increasing demand for size and weight reduction, cost savings, low power consumption, increased frequency and higher functionality and reconfigurability as part of multiband and multistandard operation is necessitating the use of highly integrated RF front-end circuits. Chip scaling has made a major contribution to this goal, but today a situation has been reached where the presence of numerous off-chip passive RF components imposes a critical bottleneck to further integration and miniaturization of wireless transceivers. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology is a rapidly emerging enabling technology that is intended to replace the discrete passives by their integrated counterparts. In this thesis, an original metal surface micromachining process, which is compatible with CMOS post-processing, for above-IC integration of RF MEMS tunable capacitors and suspended inductors is presented. A detailed study on SF 6 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) releasing has been performed in order to ascertain the optimal process parameters. This study has emphasized the fact that temperature {{plays an important role}} in this process by limiting silicon dioxide etching. Moreover, the optimized recipe has been found to be independent of the sacrificial layer used (amorphous or polycrystalline silicon) and its thickness. Using this recipe, 15. 6 µm/min Si underetch rate with high Si: SiO 2 selectivity (> 20000 : 1) has been obtained. Single-air-gap and double-air-gap parallel-plate MEMS tunable capacitors have been designed, fabricated and characterized in the pF range, from 1 MHz to 13. 5 GHz. It has been shown that an optimized design of the suspended membrane and direct symmetrical current feed at both ports can significantly improve the quality factor and increase the self-resonant <b>frequency,</b> <b>pushing</b> it to 12 GHz and beyond. The maximum capacitance tuning range obtained for a single-air-gap capacitor is 29 % for a bias voltage of 20 V. The maximum capacitance tuning range obtained for a double-air-gap capacitor is 207 % for a bias voltage of 70 V. The post-processing of X-FAB BiCMOS wafers has been successfully demonstrated to fabricate monolithically integrated VCOs with above-IC MEMS LC tank. Comparing a suspended inductor and the X-FAB inductor with the same design, it has been shown that increasing the thickness of the spiral from 2. 3 to 4 µm and having the spiral suspended 3 µm above the passivation layers lead to an improvement factor of 2 for the peak quality factor and a shift of the self-resonant frequency beyond 15 GHz. No significant variation on bipolar and MOS transistors characteristics due to the post-processing has been observed and we conclude that the variation due to post-processing is in the same range as the wafer-to-wafer variation. Based on our metal surface micromachining process, coplanar waveguide (CPW) MEMS shunt capacitive switches and variable true-time delay lines (V-TTDLs) have been designed, fabricated and characterized in the 1 - 20 GHz range. A novel MEMS device architecture: the SG-MOSFET, which combines a solid-state MOS transistor and a metal suspended gate has been proposed as DC current switch. The corresponding fabrication process using polysilicon as a sacrificial layer has been developed to release metal gate suspended over gate oxide by SF 6 plasma. Very abrupt current switches have been demonstrated with subthreshold slope better than 10 mV/decade (better than the theoretical solid-state bulk or SOI MOSFET limit of 60 mV/decade) and ultra-low gate leakage (less than 0. 001 pA/µm 2) due to the air-gap...|$|E

For this study, we have chosen a financial risk management context to investigate the relationship between data quality and value of risk management forecasting systems. Three attributes of data quality, frequency, response time, and accuracy, along with the cost of data are considered. Joint impacts of attributes are also considered. It is shown that an increase in report frequency results in an increase in the utility of a risk management forecasting system, but this increase is limited by the responsiveness of the hedging scheme. Frequency is shown to improve the utility of the forecasting systems in two ways: First, an increase in <b>frequency</b> <b>pushes</b> the predicted states closer to the actual states and second, an increase in frequency causes the reliability of the forecasting model to increase. A delay in response time of reports is predicted to have a greater impact on utility for high frequency reports than for low frequency reports.

40|$|Objective. To study {{wheelchair}} skill acquisition in handrim wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill in able-bodied male novices {{to simulate}} early rehabilitation. Major content of paper. Mechanical efficiency (ME) {{is a measure}} to evaluate {{the performance of the}} wheelchair-user combination and is sensitive to changes in the wheelchair-user interface as well as to skill acquisition. ME is defined as the ratio between external power output and the energy consumption. When the wheelchair configuration is kept constant, changes in efficiency {{can be attributed to the}} user. Changes in propulsion technique due to continued, often implicit, motor learning account for a higher ME. The changes in ME and propulsion technique due to the implicit motor learning process were studied in a three week learning experiment (3 times a week for 8 min at 0. 21 W/kg) with 9 able-bodied subjects, novice to handrim wheelchair propulsion, simulating early rehabilitation. No instructions on technique or feedback on results were given. Methods. Instrumented wheels allowed for measuring three-dimensional forces and torques on the handrim in real life situations. Combining these wheels during treadmill wheelchair propulsion with analysis of energy cost gives the possibility to compare physiological parameters to the biomechanics of wheelchair propulsion over the learning period. From the force data different propulsion technique parameters e. g. timing (<b>frequency,</b> <b>push</b> time, angle) and force application (force magnitude and direction, periods of negative power) were derived. Results. Already within the first 12 minutes changes in timing and force production occurred. Peak torques were reduced, work per cycle increased, while <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> decreased, at a stable power output and speed of the treadmill. Over the three weeks of practice propulsion technique kept changing and was accompanied with an increase in ME. Conclusion. Results suggest skill acquisition because of motor learning by all users in the group. The rise in ME seems logically related to propulsion technique, but is not yet fully understood. More insight in motor learning and skill acquisition will contribute to understanding and optimizing rehabilitation strategies in the light of wheelchair provision in early rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Double white dwarfs are {{expected}} {{to be a source of}} confusion-limited noise for the future gravitational wave observatory LISA. In a specific frequency range, this 'foreground noise' is predicted to rise above the instrumental noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e. g., gravitational waves arising from stellar mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes. In many previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and Roche-Lobe Overflow Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal. Since > 99 % of remnant binaries which have orbital periods within the LISA sensitivity range are white dwarf binaries, we consider only these binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but becomes significant at higher <b>frequencies,</b> <b>pushing</b> the <b>frequency</b> at which the foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to > 6 mHz. We find that it is important to consider the population of mass transferring binaries in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (~ 11300) of Galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal-to-noise ratio > 5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA. We present the LISA gravitational wave signal from the Galactic population of white dwarf binaries, show the most important formation channels contributing to the LISA disc and bulge populations and discuss the implications of these new findings.

Methods: Fifteen complete SCI were recruited and performed wheelchair propulsion test that consists in to push the manual wheelchair in a 10 meters path as fast as possible. Average speed, <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> (cadence) and time of displacement were measured before and after WBV intervention. WBV consisted in 5 sets of 30 second vibration with 60 second rest between. The positioning on the platform consisted in supporting the elbows and forearms. Results: Results show a significant increase in average speed and time of displacement. There was no significant difference in <b>push</b> <b>frequency.</b> Conclusion: In conclusion, WBV is an effective tool increasing upper limb performance during propulsion of the wheelchair and it can be useful during the treatment of SCI individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} {{the relationships between the}} 20 M Sprint Capacity Test utilizing SmartWheel technology and other speed evaluation techniques. The goal of the 20 M Sprint Capacity Test is to provide an objective protocol for coaches and players to measure speed, training, and performance growth. All participants (N = 17) performed two trials of the 20 M Sprint Capacity test with the SmartWheel placed on each side of a wheelchair, provided by the researcher. Results of this research focus on the potential relationships existing between the variables of push length (r =. 650), <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> (r =. 594), peak force (r =. 540), and speed performance as measured in meters/second by the SmartWheel. The relationships between classification level of the athletes and speed in meters/second suggested a significant relationship (r =. 859). Due to the highly correlated relationship between classification level and speed, athlete classification (i. e., class) was partialed out to control for this relationship. When partial correlations were analyzed, push length and speed were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 175, p =. 532). <b>Push</b> <b>frequency</b> and speed (m/s) remained significantly correlated (r =. 573, p =. 026); however, peak force and speed (m/s) also were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 464, p =. 081). Additional research is needed to further validate these results and develop spee...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{individuals}} with {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI), propulsion by older adults is poorly defined. The goal of this project is to examine the impact of wheelchair, surface, and user characteristics on propulsion mechanics in older adults and individuals with SCI. All participants self-propelled over a series of surfaces at a self-selected velocity and kinetic data collection were provided by the SmartWheel. We described a standard clinical protocol (SCP) for objective assessment of manual wheelchair propulsion and defined reference values for individuals with SCI based this protocol (N= 128). The SCP requires self-propulsion over tile, low pile carpet, and up an ADA ramp. In addition we provided a decision framework based on graphical reference data; guiding clinicians through an objective assessment of propulsion, identifying opportunities for intervention and follow-up. We then compared propulsion of individuals with paraplegia (IP, N= 54) and older adults (OA, N= 53). OA propelled slower than IP; used a greater <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> and minimum Mz, shorter stroke length, and similar resultant force. When surface difficulty increased, the IP group responded with increased work. This may indicate a lack of capacity in OA to respond to increased resistance. For our cohort of older adults we defined the impact of surface type, wheelchair weight, and rear axle position (N= 53). As surface difficulty or chair weight increased, velocity decreased. Controlling for velocity, <b>push</b> <b>frequency,</b> resultant and tangential force increased as surface difficulty increased; heavier chairs had decreased stroke length and increased resultant and tangential force; and posterior axle positions had increased velocity. Controlling for velocity, posterior axle positions had increased forces. Finally, we examined the impact of strength and gender. Body-weight normalized grip strength was collected. Stronger individuals propel faster than weaker individuals. On low pile carpet, both genders decreased velocity versus tile, but women decreased <b>push</b> <b>frequency</b> while men increased. Surface type has a substantial impact on propulsion velocity and force; magnifying any differences between users and wheelchair configurations. Wheelchair weight and axle position independently affect propulsion mechanics. Gender and strength appear to influence propulsion. Older adults are marginal self-propellers at best; powered mobility may be a more appropriate mobility solution...|$|R
50|$|Direct {{resonance}} can be equated {{to someone}} pushing {{a child on}} a swing. If the <b>frequency</b> of the <b>pushing</b> (external forcing) matches the natural frequency of the child-swing system, direct resonance can be achieved. Parametric resonance, on the other hand, is the child shifting his/her own weight with time (twice {{the frequency of the}} natural frequency) and building up the oscillatory amplitude of the swing without anyone helping to push. In other words, there is an internal transfer of energy (instead of simply dissipating all available energy) as the system parameter (child's weight) modulates and changes with time.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an experiment}} in sending regular Short Message Service (SMS) messages to support language learning, and vocabulary learning in particular, at beginners 2 ̆ 7 level in Italian at an Australian university. The approach we took built on the initiatives of Thornton and Houser (2005) and Dias (2002 b), and was informed {{by the results of}} an earlier trial we had conducted with students at high-intermediate level (Levy & Kennedy, 2005). In testing the possibilities for using mobile phones for language learning purposes, we were especially interested in investigating the acceptability of a ‘push’ mode of operation, in which the scheduling of messages is determined by the teachers. While the students appreciated the experience overall, and found the message content often useful or enjoyable, there was a wide range of views on the frequency of messages acceptable. We are therefore planning the further integration of messaging into the course around a flexible arrangement involving options for high or low <b>frequency</b> of <b>pushed</b> messages, as well as messages available on request – in ‘pull’ mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{optoelectronic}} oscillator (OEO) is {{a unique}} device based on photonics techniques to generate highly spectrally pure microwave signals [1]. The development of the OEO was motivated by the need for high performance oscillators in the frequency range larger than 10 GHz, where conventional electronic oscillators {{have a number of}} limitations. These limitations typically stem from the product of fQ, where f is the oscillator frequency and Q is the quality factor of the resonator in the oscillator. In conventional resonators, whether electromagnetic or piezoelectric, this product is usually a constant. Thus, as the oscillator <b>frequency</b> is <b>pushed</b> higher, the quality factor degrades, resulting in degradation of the phase noise of the oscillator. An approach to mitigate the problem is to start with a very high quality signal in the 5 to 100 MHz range generated by a quartz oscillator and multiply the frequency to achieve the desired microwave signal. Here again, frequency multiplication also results in an increase of the phase noise by a factor of 2010 gN, where N is the multiplication factor...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in MOSFET technology have moved the switching frequencies of power circuits into the mega-Hertz range. The drive to these higher switching frequen-cies is motivated entirely by the smaller energy storage elements that supposedly result. Unfortunately, at these very high frequencies, the allowable ripple levels on the {{input and output}} of the power circuits are often much lower than they are at lower frequencies. This then requires greater ripple attenuation which means {{that all of the}} desired energy storage reduction cannot be achieved. As switching <b>frequencies</b> are <b>pushed</b> higher, the passive filtration elements often come to dominate the size and cost of the converter. In many cases, however, some of the large, costly, passive filter elements can be replaced with small, simple, active circuits. The result is savings in cost, size, and weight, of the overall filter. It is the purpose of this thesis to outline these cases and develope these active circuits. The thesis first describes the situations in which these active filters find their greatest import. It then moves on to developing the theory and evaluation criteria surrounding these filters. After discussing in depth, the various filter topologies, and available activ...|$|R
