30|$|Polychloroprene (CR) is {{commonly}} known as an excellent, versatile synthetic rubber with a variety of industrial application range. It has several advantages like extraordinary oil and fuel resistance, toughness, good adhesion to other materials and high heat resistance up to 100  °C [18]. The commercial application of CR was started in 1932 [19]. CR is available in both dry and latex forms. Dry grades of polychloroprene rubber are normally used in industrial and automotive rubber goods, such as hoses and belts. Latex grades of polychloroprene rubber are used in waterborne adhesives and <b>dipped</b> <b>goods,</b> such as gloves and constant velocity joint boots. Several studies have been reported on the incredible property improvement of CR nanocomposites in the presence of different types of nano filler [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Das et al. [18] studied the effect of surface-modified filler on CR-based nanocomposites with two different types of clay materials, namely montmorillonite (MMT) and layered double hydroxide (LDH). It was observed that organic modification improves the reinforcing efficiency of MMT in a greater extent than that of LDH [18]. Das et al. [20] explained an approach of compatibilization between polychloroprene (CR) and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) using nano clay as a compatibilizer as well as strong reinforcing filler. The remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of CR nanocomposites in the presence of ionic liquid modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was reported by Subramaniam et al. [21]. This was mainly due to the fine dispersion of modified MWCNTs within the CR matrix [21]. Very recently, Fahma et al. [23] elucidated that excellent improvement in the mechanical properties of CR was observed due to the introduction of a small amount of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) into the CR matrix. Moreover, most of the studies in the literature have reported fantastic property improvement of CR nanocomposites based on either MWCNTs or nano clay as nano filler. But, the vast study on nano CaCO 3 -filled CR composites is still very scanty.|$|E

When presented with stationary stimuli it was found that cells which respond best to slowly moving stimuli generally have tonic discharges, long time to peak latencies and often long minimal durations of stimulation. In contrast, cells which respond preferentially to fast stimuli have phasic discharges, short latencies and short critical durations of stimulation when presented with stationary flashed slits. In the latter type of cells the responses to very fast stimulus movement were abolished selectively when contrast and width of the stimulus were not optimal. A few cells exhibited a velocity-response (VR) curve with a central <b>dip</b> indicating <b>good</b> responsiveness to either slow or fast movement but little to medium velocities.

40|$|Fifteen Mile Stream gold district, Nova Scotia, is {{situated}} on a composite anticlinal dome. The folded rocks are the Goldenville formation of quartzites with interbedded slates, {{believed to be}} Pre-Cambrian in age. Interbedded quartz veins of saddle vein type occur in slates, along slate-quartzite contacts and rarely in the quartzites. Sections of these veins contain sufficient gold to constitute ore bodies. The dome has been truncated by erosion. The district has been sheared regionally and shows a well defined fracture pattern consisting of two sets of main shears with their accompanying fractures. The local fold structure did not control the direction of shearing. Both sets of shears acted as channels for quartz-forming solutions later than the interbedded quartz veins.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} fractured reservoirs and determine their fracture parameters with a high definition array laterolog, we built a fracture-induced anisotropic formation model with a parallel fracture group. The three-dimensional finite element method is used to simulate {{the responses of the}} array laterolog, and then the primary inversion method is utilized. Numerical simulation shows that when the fracture spacing is small, the array laterolog response of the fracture group is {{the same as that of}} a formation with macroscopic electrical anisotropy. The apparent resistivity of the array laterolog is approximately inversely proportional to fracture porosity. The anisotropy depends on the fracture porosity in the fractured formation, which accordingly results in response variation of the array laterolog. The higher the fracture dip, the larger the apparent resistivity. When the fracture dip is low the difference between the deep and shallow apparent resistivities is small, and when the dip is high the difference turns out to be positive. The fracture parameters were inverted using the Marquardt non-linear least squares method. The results, both fracture porosity and <b>dip</b> show a <b>good</b> match with parameters in the actual formation model.

If the amorphous native surface oxide layer (typically: 20 - 40 Angstrom thickness) {{is included in the}} simulations, the agreement between simulated and measured channeling <b>dips</b> is very <b>good.</b> Discrepancies can be explained by imperfections of the crystals, mainly in the surface region, which cause an enhanced multiple scattering of the ions. According to the simulations, the strongest channeling effect occurs for a depth of about 200 Angstrom. Further decreasing the depth region width results in a drastic reduction of the compensation shoulders and, depending on the exact location of the tilt plane, of psi(1 / 2). This behavior is correlated to a change of the flux in the transverse plane from a "shadow cone" regime, for the first 100 Angstrom, to a flux centered in the channel after about 200 Angstrom.

40|$|Graphene-based {{materials}} have attracted considerable interest {{due to their}} potential use in {{a broad range of}} applications including membrane separations, electronic devices and biomaterials. Their performance in many of these applications relies on the ability to precisely control the layer number and density of films over large areas. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) {{is one of the most}} promising methods to produce single layer graphene. However, the high cost, limited choice of substrates and error-prone transfer processes limit its application. On the other hand, laboratory-scale film processing approaches like spin/spray-coating, filtration and drop-casting are incapable of producing films with nanometer-scale control of film thickness and uniformity and/or over the large length scales required for many applications. Recently, the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition technique has been applied to graphene and graphene oxide with some success. In this method, the material is dispersed at the air-water interface, the floating material, held up by surface tension, is densified by the compression of two floating barriers and the resulting film is transferred onto substrates by <b>dip</b> coating. While <b>good</b> control over layer number and film density has been achieved, the technique is currently limited to small area films and suffers from the challenge that only ~ 1 % of the material is retained at the interface during transfer while the rest is lost in the sub-phase. In this work, we developed a directed assembly process for producing GO monolayers at the air-water interface which assemble into densely tiled films without the requirement to use adjustable barriers. We demonstrate that the resulting directional film growth is amenable to roll-to-roll fabrication. By choosing a suitable spreading solvent, we obtained high-yield transfer to the air-water interface measuring Langmuir surface areas as high as 800  m 2 /g. Furthermore, we used both in situ Brewster angle microscopy and a custom-made Langmuir-Adam balance to study the mechanism of film formation. We also successfully extended our process to monolayer films of other 2 D nanomaterials such as MoS 2. As a first example of the utility of these films, we deposit dense GO monolayers onto silver nanowire transparent electrodes and demonstrate their ability to protect the nanowires from degrading under high currents...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demand for oil}} and gas in the world today drives the need for new and improved methods for identifying hydrocarbon prospects. The petroleum industry uses information about the subsurface in the exploration and production of oil and gas. The industry's tendency to explore deeper waters and more geologically complex areas requires reliable and more robust methods for extracting such information. This thesis illustrates possible strategies for using seismic reflection data in the inversion for subsurface earth properties. One strategy which is the traditional approach in seismic is to consider inversion as a stepwise procedure consisting of a model-driven global reflectivity imaging process (migration) followed by target-related elastic inversion of the reflectivity information into earth property parameters. In this thesis a method describing wave equation prestack depth migration of converted wave data in anisotropic media is presented. The migration is accomplished by numerical wavefield extrapolation in the frequency-space domain using precomputed space-variant fillter operators. Imaging is performed by crosscorrelating the source wavefield with the data wavefield at each depth level. Data examples demonstrate <b>good</b> <b>dip</b> response and correct kinematic behavior and illustrate the method's ability to handle complex multi-layer models with a relatively high degree of anisotropy. By considering seismic inversion as a stepwise approach, this thesis also presents a method for inversion of reflection information into medium parameters. The method provides estimation of density and P-wave and S-wave velocities at the seafloor by inversion of the acoustic-elastic PP reflection coefficient estimated at the seafloor. The PP reflection coefficient is calculated in the frequency-slowness domain from seafloor measurements of the pressure and the vertical component of the particle velocity. The algorithm gives estimates of seafloor parameters in good agreement with the true model parameters. Another strategy for using seismic data in the inversion for subsurface earth properties is to perform inversion as a data-driven procedure where the medium parameters are directly inverted for. In this thesis a new method on inverse scattering for the estimation of the medium properties of a onedimensional acoustic layered medium from single scattering data is presented. The method provides an explicit, non-iterative and fully data-driven solution of the inverse one-dimensional scattering problem. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|Compressive Sensing has {{attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} over the last decade within the areas of applied mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering because of it suggesting that we can sample a signal under the limit that traditional sampling theory provides. By then using dierent recovery algorithms we are able to, theoretically, recover the complete original signal even though we have taken very few samples to begin with. It has been proven that these recovery algorithms work best on signals that are highly compressible, meaning that the signals can have a sparse representation where the majority of the signal elements are close to zero. In this thesis we implement some of these recovery algorithms and investigate how these perform practically on a real video signal consisting of 300 sequential image frames. The video signal will be under sampled, using compressive sensing, and then recovered using two types of strategies, - One where no time correlation between successive frames is assumed, using the classical greedy algorithm Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and a more robust, modied OMP called Predictive Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (PrOMP). - One newly developed algorithm, Dynamic Iterative Pursuit (DIP), which assumes and utilizes time correlation between successive frames. We then performance evaluate and compare these two strategies using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) as a metric. We also provide visual results. Based on investigation of the data in the video signal, using a simple model for the time correlation and transition probabilities between dierent signal coecients in time, the <b>DIP</b> algorithm showed <b>good</b> recovery performance. The main results showed that DIP performed better and better over time and outperformed the PrOMP up to a maximum of 6 dB gain at half of the original sampling rate but performed slightly below the PrOMP in a smaller part of the video sequence where the correlation in time between successive frames in the original video sequence suddenly became weaker. Compressive sensing har blivit mer och mer uppmarksammat under det senaste decenniet inom forskningsomraden sasom tillampad matematik, datavetenskap och elektroteknik. En stor anledning till detta ar att dess teori innebar att det blir mojligt att sampla en signal under gransen som traditionell samplingsteori innebar. Genom att sen anvanda olika aterskapningsalgoritmer ar det anda teoretiskt mojligt att aterskapa den ursprungliga signalen. Det har visats sig att dessaaterskapningsalgoritmer funkar bast pa signaler som ar mycket kompressiva, vilket innebar att dessa signaler kan representeras glest i nagon doman dar merparten av signalens koecienter ar nara 0 i varde. I denna uppsats implementeras vissa av dessaaterskapningsalgoritmer och vi undersoker sedan hur dessa presterar i praktiken pa en riktig videosignal bestaende av 300 sekventiella bilder. Videosignalen kommer att undersamplas med compressive sensing och sen aterskapas genom att anvanda 2 typer av strategier, - En dar ingen tidskorrelation mellan successiva bilder i videosignalen antas genom att anvanda klassiska algoritmer sasom Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) och en mer robust, modierad OMP : Predictive Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (PrOMP). - En nyligen utvecklad algoritm, Dynamic Iterative Pursuit (DIP), som antar och nyttjar en tidskorrelation mellan successiva bilder i videosignalen. Vi utvarderar och jamfor prestandan i dessa tva olika typer av strategier genom att anvanda Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) som jamforelseparameter. Vi ger ocksa visuella resultat fran videosekvensen. Baserat pa undersokning av data i videosignalen visade det sig, genom att anvanda enkla modeller, bade for tidskorrelationen och sannolikhetsfunktioner for vilka koecienter som ar aktiva vid varje tidpunkt, att DIP algoritmen visade battre prestanda an de tva andra tidsoberoende algoritmerna under visa tidsekvenser. Framforallt de sekvenser dar videosignalen inneholl starkare korrelation i tid. Som mest presterade DIP upp till 6 dB battre an OMP och PrOMP...|$|R
