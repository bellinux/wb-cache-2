500|$|Paris's urbanism {{laws have}} been under strict control since the early 17th century, {{particularly}} where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974–2010 building <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> of [...] was raised to [...] in central areas and [...] in some of Paris's peripheral quarters, yet {{for some of the}} city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. The [...] Montparnasse tower was both Paris and France's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.|$|E
2500|$|Clearance - The {{concrete}} roadway portal {{was designed}} for straight-through passage of semi-trailer trucks, but the sharp curves {{before and after the}} viaduct require serpentine turning to navigate the portal resulting in truck/viaduct collisions. [...] Over the past 57 years the viaduct has been struck thousands of times causing damage to vehicles and the viaduct at its most vulnerable point. [...] Unsuspecting truck drivers easily pass through the larger portal but on their return trip are faced with tighter turns and a smaller portal. [...] Northbound truck drivers who do not heed the <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> often get stuck in the smaller portal due to their vehicles' large wall-to-wall turning circle, resulting in major traffic delays while rescue crews extract the wedged vehicle. [...] When trucks get stuck under the viaduct they also block access to Neponset Place, a residential driveway and a business. [...] Some truck drivers avoid the northbound passage by waiting until there is no traffic in the southbound lane, then hastily driving the wrong way through the larger portal, creating a potential hazard to oncoming traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Opposition to {{the project}} had begun before the April 5 {{official}} announcement at a Planning Commission meeting. The meeting was attended by 300 people {{and a number of}} attendees were opposed or skeptical of the idea that the skyscrapers would be taller than City Hall. Critics feared breaking the [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] would lead to the development of more tall skyscrapers that would end up dwarfing City Hall and changing the makeup of the city. Critic of the plan and former Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon said, [...] "Once [...] smashed, it's gone." [...] A phone poll conducted by the Philadelphia Daily News had callers opposing breaking the height barrier by 3,809 to 1,822 and Philadelphia Inquirer editorial feared the skyscrapers would ruin downtown. The location of City Hall was intended as the city's center from the city's founding and critics feared taller buildings would move the city's center away from City Hall. Critics of breaking the height ceiling favored the smaller scale of the cityscape and felt that a Philadelphia with skyscrapers would affect the livability of the city. Edmund Bacon and Center City civic leaders said that Philadelphia owes its livability and charm to its low profile. Chairman of the City Planning Commission, Graham S. Finney, noted that there was a general feeling that the sky above the city was considered a public space. Supporters of breaking the <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> noted that the project would bring needed jobs and business to Center City and that shorter buildings were already blocking views of City Hall from certain directions.|$|E
50|$|A grid deck is {{indispensable}} in professional and touring theatres, and desirable in all theatres with a fly tower, providing invaluable access and flexibility to fly systems. However, due to <b>height</b> <b>limitations,</b> not all fly towers {{are equipped with}} a grid. Transverse catwalks are sometimes provided as compensation {{for the lack of}} a grid. San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, not burdened by <b>height</b> <b>limitations,</b> has two grid decks.|$|R
25|$|The PBA Fiesta Conference was {{a former}} tournament held during a Philippine Basketball Association season. Each PBA team was allowed to hire a single foreign player, with maximum <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> set by the league, {{to play for the}} said tournament.|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter rockets {{would be}} shorter in height than the Ares V, {{permitting}} very long payload fairings and thus greater total internal volume than {{possible with the}} taller Ares V, which would quickly encounter restraints due to <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> within the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} comply with <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> close to the airport, the pitch is sunk {{below the level of}} the land around the stadium.|$|E
50|$|FuG 103: Pulse Modulated Altimeter. Improved {{version of}} Fug 102 with reduced min <b>height</b> <b>limitation,</b> {{therefore}} Fug 101 could be dispensed with. Small numbers produced in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{currently}} a maximum height limit of {{one hundred and fifty}} feet for the Central Business District. [...] There is no <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> for most of the East End/Bayou neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Land in the Lower Downtown Historic District is zoned B-7, which {{includes}} building <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> and encourages mixed-use development and provides strict design guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction. Projects {{must go through}} an architectural design review, which allows LoDo to retain its pedestrian scale and historic character as it continues to densify.|$|R
5000|$|The Big Bend's U-shape was {{conceived}} {{as an attempt}} to circumvent zoning regulations restricting skyscraper height in Manhattan, and also {{as a response to the}} proliferation of luxury supertall skyscrapers in the area. Ioannis Oikonomou has said that the building [...] "can become a modest architectural solution to the <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> of Manhattan." ...|$|R
50|$|While true 18' skiffs have no {{sail area}} or mast <b>height</b> <b>limitations,</b> the limit that the 18 footer League has {{specified}} for their one-design sub class is a maximum mast height of 33 ft (10 m), truly powerful on an 18' hull. The entire rig, which supports sails with unlimited area, is currently controlled by three trapezing crew members.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to make a horizontal travelling from a few dozen centimetres above a lake, a corn field or a forest without creating the least surface movement, followed up with a vertical travelling with a progressive crane movement without <b>height</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 35 mm VistaVision was a {{wide screen}} orthographic system. The wide image was {{obtained}} by running the film horizontally across the gate so that the width limitation of the film was transformed to a <b>height</b> <b>limitation.</b> See the VistaVision article for more information.|$|E
50|$|The one lane {{bridge is}} still in use for {{vehicles}} but has a <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> of 6 feet and 6 inches. The bridge consists of two distinct spans, one span of 102 feet and the other 75 feet in length, {{both of which are}} of the Pratt Truss bridge design.|$|E
40|$|Using the Adage- 50 (with 16 k memory) {{the authors}} created a interactive, {{real-time}} display that {{allowed for the}} graphic modelling of building shapes {{while at the same}} time giving a readout of critical design parameters. This enabled the designer, at an early stage, to create a building shape that would fit within the design requirements of square footage, building footprint and <b>height</b> <b>limitations...</b>|$|R
50|$|After the 1950s, {{suburban}} expansion {{reduced the}} commercial and residential density of the city, while in the early 1960s, nearby Clayton, Missouri eliminated its <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> on buildings. Clayton, which is the county seat of St. Louis County, Missouri, became an alternative to downtown St. Louis for commercial construction in the 1960s and 1970s. Various urban renewal projects cleared several low-income areas of St. Louis for residential housing projects.|$|R
50|$|Arbor pits, where provided, are troughs at {{the stage}} edge that provide {{additional}} vertical travel to a counterweight system's arbors. Providing a counterweight arbor pit can help compensate for <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> of a fly tower. The trough depth typically ranges from 2 to 10 feet. Shallower pits may be accessible only from above {{at the stage}} deck. Deeper pits are sometimes accessible from a trap room or orchestra pit.|$|R
50|$|Rouse was the {{developer}} of One Liberty Place, designed by Helmut Jahn, the first structure in Philadelphia {{to exceed the}} traditional <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> established by {{the top of the}} statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia City Hall. He famously clashed with city planner Edmund Bacon over the landmark development, which was quickly followed by additional tall buildings. Rouse was the nephew of developer James Rouse.|$|E
50|$|The {{submersible}} bridge's primary {{advantage over}} the similar lift bridge {{is that there is}} no structure above the shipping channel and thus no <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> on ship traffic. This is particularly important for sailing vessels. Additionally, the lack of an above-deck structure is considered aesthetically pleasing, a similarity shared with the Chicago-style bascule bridge and the table bridge. However, the presence of the submerged bridge structure limits the draft of vessels in the waterway.|$|E
50|$|FuG 101: FM (Frequency Modulated) CW (Continuous Wave) Altimeter. Operating {{frequency}} 337 - 400 MHz. (75 - 89 cm) Selectable {{between two}} ranges, 0 - 150 Meters and 0 - 750 Meters. Units were {{small enough to}} be fitted to single-engine day fighters and night fighters. Fitted generally at first but later in the war only to aircraft expected to operate at night. In larger aircraft usually paired with Fug 102 due to its max <b>height</b> <b>limitation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} had almost doubled by 1933 and {{the implementation of}} the building plots and the alignment of buildings were seen as restrictive by the influx of architects of the Modernist Movement. By 1938 <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> were loosened, population density allowed to double and proposed open spaces were [...] "often converted into more residential blocks". Land owners were reluctant to relinquish their land for public use and the municipality lacked the funding to purchase it.|$|R
30|$|The {{selected}} level of ductility {{depends on the}} type of the SFRS, the seismicity of building location, the building dynamic characteristics, and the <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> of the design code. Adebar et al. (2014) stated that the selection of ductility level for RC shear wall buildings depends mainly on the seismic hazard of the region. They mentioned that conventional, moderately ductile, and ductile walls are the systems of choice in low, medium, and high seismic hazard zones, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Munich {{features}} a wide and {{diverse array of}} modern architecture, although strict <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> for buildings have limited the construction of skyscrapers. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at {{the northern edge of}} Munich, like the Hypo-Haus, the Arabella High-Rise Building, the Highlight Towers, Uptown Munich and the BMW Headquarters ( [...] with the adjoining BMW Welt) next to the Olympic Park. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city center and on the Siemens campus in southern Munich.|$|R
50|$|A major {{commercial}} and residential development, Proctor Station - 2015, has been a controversial project due to its size and cost. It offers retail {{on the ground floor}} with apartments in the five floors above that. A proposed similar project {{at the other end of}} the Proctor District promises to be more controversial with many local residents formed in opposition and attempting to lower the <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> from 65 feet to 45 feet, a move developers oppose as it will limit the profitability of the project.|$|E
50|$|Paris's urbanism {{laws have}} been under strict control since the early 17th century, {{particularly}} where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974-2010 building <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> of 37 m was raised to abbr=on 50 m in central areas and 180 m in some of Paris's peripheral quarters, yet {{for some of the}} city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. The 210 m Montparnasse tower was both Paris and France's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.|$|E
5000|$|Glaeser admired {{many aspects}} of the work of Jane Jacobs; they both argue that [...] "cities are good for the environment." [...] He {{disagreed}} with her on densification through height. He advocates for higher buildings in cities while Jacobs deplored the 1950s and 1960s public housing projects inspired by Le Corbusier. The austere, dehumanizing New York high rises eventually became the [...] "projects" [...] straying far from their original intent. She believed in preserving West Greenwich Village's smaller historical buildings for personal, economic and aesthetic reasons. Glaeser grew up in a high rise and believes that higher buildings provide more affordable housing. He calls for elimination or lessening of <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> restrictions, preservationist statutes and other zoning laws.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method to {{retrieve}} continuous water vapor profiles {{from a combination of}} a Raman lidar and a microwave radiometer. The integrated water vapor from the microwave radiometer is used to calibrate the Raman lidar operationally resulting in small biases compared to radiosondes. The <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> for Raman lidars (cloud base and daylight contamination) can be well compensated by the application of a two-step algorithm combining the Raman lidars mass mixing ratio and the microwave radiometers brightness temperatures...|$|R
50|$|The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) {{filed suit}} against the City of Los Angeles, alleging that the city {{violated}} laws and the city charter when it approved the development of two residential towers {{that are expected to}} be up to 30 stories tall. The City Council changed existing zoning and <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> to allow the development, which would be next to AHF's Hollywood headquarters. A spokesperson for the development accused Michael Weinstein of filing the suit to maintain the view from his office.|$|R
5000|$|Riser {{cards are}} used in rack-mount server and {{industrial}} computer applications. In 1U and 2U rack-mount computer systems, riser cards are integrated into the system to allow the addition of feature cards in a horizontal position (instead of a standard vertical position). This {{is due to the}} <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> of a 1U and 2U system which are 1.75" [...] and 3.5" [...] respectively. Typically, a 1U system uses a 1U single slot riser card whereas a 2U system uses a 2U 3 slot riser card.|$|R
5000|$|The {{committee}} vigorously opposed in 2012 {{any move}} to relax the building height limit. When the United States House of Representatives held {{hearings on the}} height limit's effect on redevelopment in the District of Columbia, Laura Richards testified for the Committee of 100 against any changed. [...] "Lifting the height limit will alter irretrievably the District's historic, welcoming scale without producing upside benefits," [...] she said. [...] "The Committee of 100 therefore believes that the Height Act should remain undisturbed and should be enforced vigorously." [...] Richards implied that city residents overwhelmingly supported retaining the <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> as is, and that the legislation made [...] "the frantic life of our modern world...more bearable." ...|$|E
50|$|Giba is {{not very}} tall for a volleyball player but he made up his <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> with his unique {{physical}} skills and jumping abilities. In his playing days he {{was considered one of}} the best wing spikers in the world. Giba was not only appreciated for his spectacular play but he also had desire, appeal and drive that made him loved by volleyball fans all over the world. He was named a captain of the national team because of his leadership skills. He was recognized for his highly energetic personality which was helping to motivate the whole Brazilian team to play its best. Brazil was considered nearly unbeatable in the 2000s and Giba {{was a big part of}} its success.|$|E
50|$|As one of {{the smaller}} {{shopping}} centres in Orchard Road and located adjacent to vacant land used for a car park, the property was slated for redevelopment. It was reported that the shopping centre may be vacated by the middle of 2007. One of the requirements that must be overcome by receiving an exemption was the <b>height</b> <b>limitation</b> of 16 storeys for the site. The OCBC Bank, as {{one of the}} owners of the property, had restrictions in development. The Banking Amendment Regulations (2004) restricted demolition and rebuilding of structures to more than 20% larger Redevlopment plans had to include a hotel as hotel use was safeguarded by the authorities. Speculation regarding the site's redevelopment had been ongoing for several years and included connecting a redeveloped site with The Centrepoint, a shopping centre across the road and owned by the same owners as the Specialists' Shopping Centre.|$|E
50|$|Architects {{deal with}} local and federal jurisdictions about {{regulations}} and building codes. The architect {{might need to}} comply with local planning and zoning laws, such as required setbacks, <b>height</b> <b>limitations,</b> parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and land use. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines. Health and safety risks form {{a vital part of}} current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.|$|R
5000|$|Interstate Aviation Committee, {{after initial}} {{decoding}} {{of the flight}} recorder data, issued the following flight safety recommendations: avoid entering thunderstorms, follow all maximum <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> based on aircraft load and outside air temperature, and to improve pilot training when working in these situations. According to Annex 13 [...] "Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation" [...] of Chicago Convention IAC does not issue information to public about people or organisations responsible for a crash - the only goal of an IAC investigation is to improve flight safety. Determining the guilty parties can be done only during trial.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2012, the National Capitol Planning Commission said {{it would}} study the effect which the {{building}} <b>height</b> <b>limitations</b> had on redevelopment in Washington, D.C. Committee of 100 chairman George Clark categorically ruled out any change as acceptable. The wealthy attorney said he spoke for residents of the wealthy Hillcrest enclave and the poor of neighborhood of Anacostia and said that citizens of Anacostia {{do not want to}} be treated [...] "as second class citizens and have their view sheds blocked". Clark also said he spoke for visitors to the city, none of whom wanted to see tall buildings.|$|R
