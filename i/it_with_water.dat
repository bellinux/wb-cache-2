5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
5|$|Sapumal Kumaraya (also {{known as}} Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom {{on behalf of}} the Kotte kingdom is {{credited}} with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple. Singai Pararasasegaram is credited with building the Sattanathar temple, the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the Veerakaliamman temple. He built a pond called Yamuneri and filled <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the Yamuna river of North India, which is considered holy by Hindus. He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple, as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneshwaram Temple. Major temples were normally maintained by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to those who worked in the temple, unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka, where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue.|$|E

5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E

25|$|Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{paintings}} at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting. In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain. In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting. The guards managed to quickly dilute <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> so that it penetrated only the varnish layer, and the painting was restored again.|$|E

500|$|The right whales' diets consist {{primarily}} of zooplankton, primarily the tiny crustaceans called copepods, {{as well as}} krill, and pteropods, although they are occasionally opportunistic feeders. As with other baleens, they feed by filtering prey from the water. They swim with an open mouth, filling <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and prey. The whale then expels the water, using its baleen plates to retain the prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be large enough that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough that it cannot escape. The [...] "skimming" [...] may {{take place on the}} surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies.|$|E
500|$|Arachaelogists {{have found}} {{evidence}} that Mayan chocolate consumption occurred as early as 500 BC, and there is speculation that chocolate predates even the Mayans. To make the chocolate drink, which was served cold, the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> cornmeal, chili peppers, and other ingredients. They then poured the drink {{back and forth from}} a cup to a pot until a thick foam developed. Chocolate was available to Maya of all social classes, although the wealthy drank chocolate from [...] "large spouted vessels" [...] that were often buried with elites. An early Classic period (460-480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site of Rio Azul, Guatemala, had vessels with the Maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{fortification}} was the keep, built up from the round tower of 1512–14, and [...] of the original building's walls were incorporated into the new design. The original tower had ten gunports embedded at ground level in its [...] walls, but these were blocked up in the second phase of building. The keep would originally had a parapet running around its roof, which was initially flat but converted to a ridged design in the third phase of work. The ground floor was laid in brick and had a brick and stone-lined well to supply <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> The keep had two fireplaces, but these were small and not intended for cooking – indeed, {{the final version of the}} keep was probably never used as a living space. The first floor windows were added in the final phase of work; they were not intended for use as gunports, but they had bars and shutters, so could have been easily secured in the event of an attack.|$|E

500|$|Unable to fire {{her main}} or {{secondary}} batteries {{at the three}} destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on SanFrancisco, which was passing by only [...] away. Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on SanFrancisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, {{and most of the}} bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of SanFrancisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two enemy battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and SanFrancisco, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. She had landed at least one shell in Hieis steering gear room during the exchange, flooding <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting Hieis steering capability. Helena followed SanFrancisco to try to protect her from further harm.|$|E
500|$|The lunge-feeders are the rorquals. To feed, lunge-feeders {{expand the}} volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself; to do this, the mouth inflates to expand the mouth. The inflation of the mouth causes the throat pleats to expand, {{increasing the amount of}} water that the mouth can store. Just before they ram the baitball, the jaw swings open at almost a 90° angle and bends which lets in more water. To prevent stretching the mouth too far, rorquals have a sensory organ located {{in the middle of the}} jaw to regulate these functions. Then they must decelerate. This process takes a lot of mechanical work, and is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. The skim-feeders, are right whales, gray whales, pygmy right whales, and sei whales (which also lunge feed). To feed, skim-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape. The [...] "skimming" [...] may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies. Gray whales feed primarily on the ocean's bottom, feeding on benthic creatures.|$|E
500|$|As soon as Tzazon {{received}} his brother's message, he left Sardinia {{and landed in}} Africa, joining up with Gelimer at Bulla. The Vandal king now determined to advance on Carthage. His intentions are not clear; the traditional interpretation is that he hoped to reduce the city by blockading it, but Ian Hughes believes that, lacking the reserves for a protracted war of attrition, he hoped to force Belisarius into a [...] "single, decisive confrontation". Approaching the city, the Vandal army cut the aqueduct supplying <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> and attempted to prevent provisions from arriving in the city. Gelimer also dispatched agents {{to the city to}} undermine the loyalty of the inhabitants and the imperial army. Belisarius, who was alert to the possibility of treachery, set an example by impaling a citizen of Carthage who intended to join the Vandals. The greatest danger for defection came from the Huns, who were disgruntled because they had been ferried to Africa against their will and feared being left there as a garrison. Indeed, Vandal agents had already made contact with them, but Belisarius managed to maintain their allegiance—at least for the moment—by making a solemn promise that after the final victory they would be richly rewarded and allowed to return to their homes. Their loyalty however remained suspect, and, like the Moors, the Huns probably awaited to see who would emerge as the victor and rally to him.|$|E
