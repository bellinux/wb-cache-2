[...] "Resentment" [...] features a slow groove of 70 beats per minute, with Beyoncé's vocals range spanning from the note of F3 to E5. It is built around a honeyed sample from Curtis Mayfield's [...] (1972) album: [...] "How could you lie?". In [...] "Resentment" [...] Beyoncé sings about infidelity and a boyfriend who cheats and lies to her, seen in the lines [...] "I've been crying for too long/ What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> me?/ You lied, you lied, you lied." [...] In the song, Beyoncé presents a more vulnerable side of herself, because she shows that she doesn't want her boyfriend to leave her for another woman.|$|E

If <b>you</b> are righteous, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> give God? Or what does God take from your hand?

But {{what strikes}} me as being so interesting is that we appear to feel remorse for our misdeeds; and I was almost persuaded the other day by an observer of our species, that remorse had gone out, or rather had never existed, except in the fancy of innocent people; that real criminals like ourselves were afraid of being found out, but weren't in the least sorry. Perhaps, if we are sorry, it proves that we needn't be. Let's judge each other. I've told you what my sin against Barker is, and I know yours in general terms. It's a fearful thing to {{be the cause of}} a human soul's presence in Boston; but what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> bring it about? Who is Barker? Where did he come from?

[...] Lemuel looked blankly at her, and did not answer. [...] "And Mr. Evans too! You must have had your hands full, and that's what I told the reporters; but I told 'em I guessed you'd be equal to it if any one would. Why, I don't suppose Mrs. Evans {{has been out of}} her room for a month, or hardly stepped her foot to the floor. Well, I don't want to see many people look as he did when you first got him out of the house." ...|$|E
