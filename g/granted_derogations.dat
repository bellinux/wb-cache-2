40|$|This {{evaluation}} of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores focuses on the success in accomplishing ecological, economic and social sustainability in population management {{during the period from}} 2007 to 2012, through objectives and actions in the implemented population management plans. The conclusions drawn in the evaluation are based on a logical framework which must in practice be seen as the logic behind the policy on large carnivores and associated development actions. Based on this framework, the evaluation highlighted the appropriateness, performance, efficiency and impact of the applied policy on large carnivores as well as the problems and threats of the current policy. The evaluation was performed for each species by examining the success of population management from the perspectives of ecological, economic and social sustainability. The investigation and consideration of conflicting objectives between various actors, with the view that the population management of large carnivores can be sustainably maintained, {{played a key role in}} the evaluation and, particularly, in the development proposals made. The investigation and consideration of the conflicts involved in the population management of large carnivores was in the focus of risk analysis group closely connected to the evaluation. The composition of this group varied by large carnivore species and the group deliberated over existing or potential future conflicts in the current policy on large carnivores as well as solutions for them. WOLVERINE As there is no valid population management plan in place for the wolverine, it was not possible to evaluate the success of measures taken in relation to the objectives set for them in the population management plan. However, where wolverines are concerned, a comparison was made in relation to the consultation with regional and national stakeholders that preceded the initial drafting of the population management plan. Existing research data and conflict points identified in the evaluation risk analysis also served as a point of reference. There is a long way to go towards achieving ecological, economic and social sustainability in the population management of wolverines. According to a minimum population estimate, growth in the wolverine population has been extremely moderate, and the wolverine population has been divided into two subpopulations: wolverines with habitats in the northern fells and those in the eastern forests. Specifying the size of the wolverine population is extremely challenging, and very little data has been gathered on the eastern forest wolverine. Roughly half of the wolverine population is found in the reindeer husbandry are, where it poses a great deal of economic problems. Indeed, the wolverine is the leading cause of damage to reindeer stock. Wolverine have been subjected to illegal killing and, without a population management plan or a special decree issued by the Ministry, it has not been possible to manage the wolverine population by means of a derogation procedure. There has been very little wolverine research conducted during the review period, with the primary focus being on damages to reindeer stock caused by wolverine. The lack and one-sidedness of information on wolverines have failed to meet the perceived needs of stakeholders. During the review period, damages caused by wolverine to livestock other than reindeer have been extremely minimal, primarily involving a few incidents of damage to sheep stock. On the whole, conflicts outside the reindeer husbandry area are rare, even though a nascent conflict between the wild forest reindeer and wolverines has been identified in the forest reindeer region. The biggest challenge facing wolverine population management is to put reindeer herders earning their livelihoods in regions of Fell Lapland with wolverine aggregations at the forefront of objectives and actions, thus committing them to the management of the wolverine population through rights and responsibilities. There should be a wide range of measures available, comprehensive and reliable methods for determining the population, an incentive-based damage compensation system, transplantations, derogations which are at least based on damages incurred but preferably also on population management, and other necessary financial incentives. LYNX The ecological strategic goal of lynx population management, i. e. the ecological sustainability of the lynx population, has been achieved through the application of existing population management measures. Within the reindeer husbandry area, the lynx population has shown a moderate proliferation and, in other areas of Finland, new habitats have formed together with strong, established lynx populations. At the same time, it has also been found that the ecological carrying capacity has not yet been reached. Growth in the lynx population has given rise to the use of special permits for population management, which have been allocated to achieve a more balanced distribution of regional lynx densities as well as to strengthen the economic and social sustainability of population management. Indeed, high lynx densities are precisely what cause conflicts from an economic and social sustainability standpoint. Damages to reindeer, sheep and hunting dogs as well as game taxation are substantial from an economic perspective. They also put a strain the ability of persons earning a livelihood and hunting to tolerate the presence of lynx. In the reindeer husbandry area, derogations for damages are granted for the specific purpose of preventing substantial economic damages. For many years, the touchstone of social sustainability in lynx population management has been the unreliability of the minimum population estimate for lynx. There have been challenges in determining the lynx population and an effort has been and is still being made in meeting these challenges in research and game management by developing a census method, investing in separate counts, and scaling population management derogations in order to cull regional population growth. Undoing the deep mistrust that has formed between this research and game management as well as the ‘field’ is a special challenge where all large carnivores are concerned. Unreliable lynx population estimates are also reflected in the questioning of the reliability of other large carnivore populations. A challenge in lynx population management is responding quickly to regional lynx problems. It is of the utmost importance to take the sense of insecurity and fear felt about the lynx into consideration, thus avoiding the risk of the lynx falling into disrepute as a pest. Instead, the status of the lynx as a valuable game animal should be promoted and preserved. The cornerstone of this approach is quota hunting. In recent years, population management derogations have served as an excellent tool for achieving economically and socially acceptable population management. BEAR The ecological sustainability of bear population management has been achieved by allowing the size of the bear population to grow within the dispersal zone in central parts of Finland and developing a population region in western parts of the country. Conversely, population management derogations have been used to address population growth in the reindeer husbandry area and the established population region in Eastern Finland. Finding a balance has been a challenge and, particularly in the dispersal zone, bear densities have been created. A local bear presence is revealed by the damage caused by bears. Bears are the biggest cause of damage to sheep stock and, of all the large carnivores, they are the only ones that cause damage to honeybees and crops. In order to improve the economic sustainability of bear population management, electrified fencing, among other things, has been erected to protect property. From a social sustainability standpoint, bears pose a challenge due to their large size and the sense of fear and insecurity this brings with it. The development of new surveying methods and, particularly, the SRVA (“official assistance in large game matters”) founded during the review period to provide official assistance in large game matters have contributed to the expulsion and killing of bears, especially those attempting to enter populated areas. Where bears are concerned, humans have a completely different concept of property than with other large carnivores. Bears are a major form of prey, and bear hunting has centuries-old traditions. Even today, bear hunting is based on derogations for population management, with derogations for damages being granted in very few cases. Bear hunting is also a team effort, with the use of hunting dogs adding a special nuance to the hunting experience. Regional and local bear ownership is evident in situations where there has been no desire to use all possible derogations for population management in a region with an established population. Responsibility is assumed for growth in the bear population, thus engendering a sense of regional ownership. Furthermore, suspected cases involving the illegal killing of bears are reported to the police with far greater frequency than the suspected illegal killing of other large carnivores. This might be an indication of the fact that the illegal killing of bear falls clearly outside the boundaries of what is considered the common good and there is no support for such activities. The challenge facing bear population management is to keep ecological, economic and social acceptance in balance, so that all these factors can be realised from a regional standpoint. This requires greater trust between research and game management as well as the ‘field’. However, there is positive development where bears are concerned, which is expected to continue into the future with the current array of actions in place. WOLF An unprecedented collapse in the ecological sustainability of the wolf population has been found. After the population management plan entered into effect, the wolf population for the entire country reached its peak in 2007, but has declined since then. The largest single collapse in the wolf population occurred in 2010, and the lowest population level was recorded in 2013, with a minimum population estimate of 120 individuals. This collapse in the wolf population has led to a situation whereby no derogations for population management have been granted for wolves – instead, all population management has been carried out through derogations for damages. The criteria for granting the derogations in question have been found to be challenging, with the capacity utilisation of <b>granted</b> <b>derogations</b> remaining low. Regulations on the killing of large carnivores provided for under the Police Act are applied in situations where human safety is threatened. This in itself has led to a situation where the value of wolves as prey animals has been taken away and the species is seen almost exclusively as a pest with which it is difficult to occupy the same area. In addition to ecological sustainability, the social sustainability of the wolf population has also collapsed. Local residents feel that they have no influence over managing their livelihoods or daily routines. The presence of wolves instils a sense of fear and insecurity. Wolves are the biggest cause of damages to hunting dogs, thus making hunting more difficult throughout Finland. This is seen as a problem of social acceptability. There is a deep mistrust between the field and research and game management. These differences have made the monitoring of the wolf population more difficult, also due to a failure to report follow-up observations and difficulty in tagging. The withholding of information on wolf observations also calls into question the minimum wolf population estimates. Questioning the position and knowledge of this research has created a situation in society where there is debate over who owns the correct information on wolves. Where wolf population management is concerned, there is great pressure to take active measures and make immediate adjustments. The biggest challenge facing future wolf population management is placing the rights and responsibilities of people living within wolf territories at the forefront of objectives and actions, committing them to the regional management of the wolf population through these objectives and actions. This requires complete transparency in all population management measures, from objectives to action. There should also be a wide range of measures in place, including comprehensive and reliable population management methods, population management derogations and substantial economic incentives. IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON LARGE CARNIVORES The objectives for the population management of large carnivores are set in accordance with the terms for achieving favourable conservation status, as stated in the Habitats Directive. This regulatory standard based on ecological sustainability sets the conditions for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, within which the objectives of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores together with actions taken are applied. Consequently, large carnivore management has been imposed in a top-down manner and has inevitably been lacking in terms of place-based policy. Ecological sustainability has not been based on a population-level approach, which would allow for a wider range of management measures to be taken. Local and regional views concerning the objectives and actions of the national policy on large carnivores have not influenced decision-making as desired. The multilateral conflict that arises around large carnivores is manifested in tensions between local communities, central government, rural and urban areas, laymen and researchers. The denial of national population management objectives and, on the other hand, increasing the level of mistrust between the field and the authorities and the field and researchers have made systematic population control impossible where wolves are concerned. A similar trend seems to be evolving with regard to the wolverine. The large carnivore actions taken have been called into question by citizens. People do not support large carnivore policy actions carried out by actors they do not trust. This can be seen in a lack of trust in the methods used in determining a population based on large carnivore observations and the process for granting derogations, compensations for damage and the adoption of preventive measures. Not only is the large carnivore data produced not trusted, it is also widely felt that local and regional views on the objectives of large carnivore population management are not reaching decision-makers. At worst, this mistrust culminates in the illegal killing of large carnivores, which is supported by a broad front. Using public law control measures, it is possible to more effectively discover illegal killing incidents and their perpetrators as well as impose harsher sentences on them. However, it is of the utmost importance to understand that the application of these enhanced measures will not influence the level of public support, which feels that illegal killing is justified. If the needs of people living in large carnivore regions are not met by public administration, they will be met by illegal actions taken in the field. The current array of actions will not achieve the set performance objectives or the large carnivore policy impact objectives unless the objectives behind these actions are changed. This change in objectives is seen as a way of gaining public approval and support for large carnivore policy measures. INTERDEPENDENCY OF ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS In large carnivore policy measures, equal consideration should be given to ecological, economic and social factors both in objectives and actions, stating the interdependency of these three perspectives. Large carnivore policy risks identified in risk analysis groups, which were used in support of this evaluation, showed a clear interdependency between the actions and processes that aim to achieve ecological, economic or social sustainability. The majority of the risks could be categorised as social risks, in addition to which some ecological and economic risks were found to have originated from a social risk phenomenon or, alternatively, could have posed social risks if the situation had remained unchanged. This demonstrates the clear social nature of the risks inherent in the current large carnivore policy, nearly half of which were considered probable and serious. The existing policy risks and problems highlighted in the evaluation have been set as objectives for the future large carnivore policy. When defining this future policy, the objective of ecological sustainability should not undermine the objective of social sustainability but should, instead, take into account the issue raised in this evaluation. According to this, exceeding the limits of social tolerance will lead to the failure of systematic population management based on an ecological objective. DEVELOPING THE OWNERSHIP OF LARGE CARNIVORES The current conservative, top-down approach to decision-making must be phased out. National, regional and local objectives and actions should be synchronised with one another. The primary goal of managing large carnivore populations must be to develop the psychological ownership of large carnivores, particularly at the local and regional level, but also at the national level. The psychological ownership of large carnivores is more effectively developed in situations where ownership involves a sense of community and responsibility. In developing psychological ownership, a sense of ownership is created through practical measures involving rights and responsibilities, thus affecting attitudes. As a natural resource, large carnivores should be considered property whose management carries with it both rights and responsibilities. Concrete responsibilities must be required and rights should be given regionally and locally, taking into account the differences specific to each species. All actions taken should be entirely transparent. Developing ownership requires trust through all structures and between actors. PLACE-BASED AND PROBLEM-BASED POPULATION MANAGEMENT When giving consideration to regional population management, regional diversity must be recognised and regional factors and needs must be taken into account. Conflicts involving large carnivores are local and depend not only on the presence of carnivores, but also on other game resources, livelihoods and infrastructure as well as cultural capital and traditions. Large carnivore policy actions should be targeted precisely, directly and quickly at local needs. Regional cooperation forums with the ability to respond quickly, along with regional or territorial population management plans, are considered key factors for problem-based solutions to large carnivore conflicts. Regional actions should stem from local needs and activate and involve local and/or regional stakeholders, depending on the species of large carnivore and the reason for the conflict. It is possible to integrate public funding and joint stakeholder volunteer work in population management actions...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the nitrate directive, member states have the possibility to apply for derogation, i. e. increasing fertilization standards under certain conditions. Several EU regions have made use of this possibility but all in a different way. In 2009, 6 different derogation policies were worked out. This paper focuses on the differences between the applied policies and makes an assessment of the impact of these differences on the application rate of derogation, the manure surplus and the costs to allocate the manure. Based on the MP-MAS model described by Van der Straeten et al. (2010) the different scenarios are applied on a single case area (Flanders) and the economic effects have been simulated. Results show large differences between the policy alternatives, leading to the conclusion that member states not only have to focus on the permission to allow derogation or not but also at the details of the <b>derogation</b> policy. <b>Granting</b> <b>derogation</b> at parcel level instead of farm level increases the potential effect of derogation, the height of the increase in fertilization standards under derogation determines the application rate of derogation: a higher increase leads to a higher application rate.

In the same vein it identifies and discus a list of non-tariff barriers to trade that are still prevalent in the SADC region despite the prohibition for their use under the Protocol. The list of these NTBs is made up of quantitative restrictions, customs procedures and administrative requirements, technical standards, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government participation in trade, lack of infrastructure, restrictive rules of origin and anti-dumping measures. Their impact is also addressed using some case studies based on the experience of businesses and people trading in the region. The paper concluded that the widespread and continued existence of NTBs in the region is {{as a result of a}} weak regulatory framework aimed at addressing them. To this end the paper single out the provisions relating to the <b>granting</b> of <b>derogations</b> from complying with the Protocol, the rules of origin, antidumping provisions and rules relating to the protection of infant industries as some of the weak points in the Protocol. To assess the compatibility of the rules regulating NTBs under the Protocol with the WTO rules one of the chapter is dedicated to a discussion on the WTO legal framework for NTBs. The paper also gives the reader an opportunity to have a grasp of the progress made in the SADC Free Trade Area by providing a section which focuses on the NTBs Monitoring and Elimination Mechanism. Problems associated with the mechanism are also clearly laid down in this paper. Recommendations are made at the end of the paper as way of providing solutions to some of the issues identified as weaknesses on the NTBs legal framework.

40|$|The {{advent of}} digital {{television}} has triggered {{a revolution in}} the use of radio spectrum worldwide and in particular in Europe, where the digital switchover, meaning the migration process from analogue to digital broadcasting, has led to two major consequences on spectrum use. First of all, there has been an improvement in the quality and an expansion in the range of television services, but also {{a significant part of the}} Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band has become free from traditional terrestrial broadcasting usage and released for other services. In response to the outcome of the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 07) to allocate the upper part of the UHF band - the 800 MHz in Europe - for mobile services, Europe committed to structuring a regional plan promoting harmonisation of spectrum use across EU member states. In 2012, the first Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) was approved. EU member states agreed on clearing the 800 MHz band from television broadcasting services and making it available for mobile services by 1 January 2013 (European Parliament & the Council, 2012). However, some EU member states showed a high degree of sensitivity about how intrusive the RSPP could be in the policy area of radio spectrum, which is considered a core area of national sovereignty. It is suffice to think that fourteen EU member states asked the European Commission (EC) to <b>grant</b> policy <b>derogations</b> due to a variety of exceptional reasons, having missed the previously agreed deadline, and nine of them have actually been granted. Different paths towards the allocation of the digital dividend to mobile services, in terms of policy and regulatory interventions, have been traced by EU member states under the EU umbrella. Moreover, Europe is carrying out studies on future spectrum requirements, including the 694 - 790 MHz (700 MHz) band, which will be allocated to mobile services in Europe from 2016, according to what has been stated at the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12). This band is used to be referred to with the expression 'second digital dividend'...|$|R

A quantitative risk assessment (QRA) was developed to estimate the risk of rabies introduction to the UK under both schemes to quantify {{any change in the}} risk of rabies introduction should the UK harmonize with the EU policy. Assuming 100 % compliance with the regulations, moving to the EUPMP was predicted to increase the annual risk of rabies introduction to the UK by approximately 60 -fold, from 7. 79 × 10 (- 5) (5. 90 × 10 (- 5), 1. 06 × 10 (- 4)) under the current scheme to 4. 79 × 10 (- 3) (4. 05 × 10 (- 3), 5. 65 × 10 (- 3)) under the EUPMP.

40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary <b>derogations</b> <b>granted</b> to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Huge {{differences}} {{are seen in}} the use of organic seed in different countries. In some countries, the majority of organic farmers uses organic seed of the dominating crops, while organic farmers in other countries predominately uses conventional seed. The IFOAM basic standards, the EU-regulation (Council regulation (EEC) No 2092 / 91), and standards in most countries worldwide request organic seed to be used if such seed is available. If not, the competent authority can accept the farmer to use conventional seed. Before 2004, the EU regulation on organic agriculture will be revised. The current analysis is conducted as a background paper for this revision. Description and approach A comparative study in the Nordic countries shows that the main factor {{for the development of the}} organic seed sector is the inspection procedures actually controlling that organic seed is used whenever available. The first years, the competent authority in Norway <b>granted</b> a general <b>derogation</b> to use conventional seed, since the supply of organic seed was insufficient to meet the demand in the country. This created difficulties for the Norwegian organic seed producers, since they have had to compete with the cheaper conventional seed on the market. The competent authorities in Denmark and Finland have for several years only accepted the use of conventional seed in cases, where organic seed of an appropriate variety for the actual purpose was not available. This has helped the development of the organic seed sector in these countries. The organic seed sector in Sweden has developed rapidly in the last few years where the competent authority has imposed on the farmers that conventional seed only can be used in crops where organic seed is not available. The seed certification system does not ensure that certified seed is free from seed borne diseases. As organic seed is not treated with fungicides, the seed health issue comes more into focus. A large proportion of the organic seed lots are discarded because of seed borne diseases. This makes it less profitable to produce the organic seed. Conclusions and recommendations After 2003, there will still be a need for some conventional seed, since organic seed of appropriate varieties and quality will not be available in all regions and all crops. It is essential for the development of the organic seed sector that improved inspection systems are implemented in certification programs. The EU-regulation on organic agriculture (or seed certification programs) may be adjusted to ensure that only healthy organic seed can be marketed. To promote the use and production of organic seed, the competent authorities and inspectors have to develop appropriate systems in form of updated data-bases, to monitor the availability of organic seed in their area, and to control that conventional seed is only used in cases, where organic seed is not available. To further develop the organic seed sector, the concept of availability of organic seed has to be defined in more detail, including seed health issues. To minimize the risk of seed borne diseases thresholds should be discussed and possibly defined for the relevant seed borne diseases. The competent authority should request to use organic seed in cases, where such seed meets the standards for seed health. There is a need to develop techniques to control seed borne diseases in order to minimize the volume of discarded organic seed. References Borgen, A., A-M. D. Gustavsson, J. Kieksi, T. Johnsen, R.

Eastern and Western Baltic, 12. the Kattegat, 13. the Skagerrak, North Sea, European waters in ICES Div. 2 and the Eastern Channel, 14. to the West of Scotland, 15. Irish Sea, 16. Celtic Sea, 17. Atlantic waters off the Iberian Peninsula, 18. Western Channel, 19. Western Waters and Deep Sea 20. and the Bay of Biscay, i. e. updated estimates of trends in fishing effort, landings and discards by species, CPUE and LPUE by fisheries and species, and partial fishing mortalities for effort regulated and non-regulated fisheries by Member States. Few ToR could not be accomplished due to time constraints and/or data deficiencies and will be accomplished during the forthcoming STECF EWG 13 - 13 fishing effort regime evaluations part 2 (7 - 11 October 2013, Barza d’Ispra, Italy). Outstanding ToRs are those dealing with the requested comparative analyses regarding cod and sole selectivity of fully documented fisheries (FDF) and fisheries not participating in FDF schemes, detailed evaluations of the national implementation as regards fishing effort <b>derogations</b> <b>granted</b> under the provisions of article 13 of the new cod plan (Counc. Reg. No 1342 / 2008), as well as spatio-temporal patterns in cod catchability. STECF EWG 13 - 06 tasks have been supported by the DCF fishing effort data call in 2013. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes a general improvement in data completeness and quality as well as compliance with dead lines regarding Member States’ data provisions. However, STECF EWG 13 - 06 suffered again from delays, incompleteness and erroneous data submissions and re-submissions. Details about the DCF data call definitions, data quality in 2013 and significant shortfalls as identified by JRC and the experts contributing to the working group are summarized in section 4. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that its recommendations in 2012 to amend the 2013 DCF data call to support fishing effort regime evaluation have been implemented and that these changes have supported and will support the accomplishment of specific ToR. STECF EWG 13 - 06 noted that the DCF data call in 2013 required re-submissions of re-aggregated data {{in addition to the}} re-quested data update for 2012, which implied additional workload for the national institutions involved in the DCF framework. Notably Denmark, Portugal and UK (without Scotland) have revised their complete time series of fisheries specific catch and effort data. Spanish data were made available for 2012 and discard data were inserted to earlier data submissions to support the effort regime evaluation for Southern hake and Nephrops. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that ICES (WGMIXFISH 2013) has undertaken a detailed comparison of the 2011 ICES fisheries data received in 2013 and the 2011 STECF DCF effort data received and compiled in 2012. While the fisheries specific data on landings and nominal effort are found highly consistent, the ICES estimates of discards were consistently higher than the estimates of discards provided in the STECF data base. The pronounced differences in discard estimates are mainly due to different raising procedures applied and shall be further analysed in order to identify best and consistent practices applied to discard raising (section 4. 12). STECF EWG 13 - 06, in response to the general increased interest in discard estimates, has proposed an Index of Discard Coverage DQI to facilitate the use of the discard estimates provided in the STECF data bases on fisheries specific catch and fishing effort and obtained through the 2013 DCF data call. The DQI allows identification and avoidance of the use of discard estimates by fisheries based on the proportion of sums of national landings covered by discard estimates in relation to the overall sums of national landings. The method to derive the DQI and the interpretation of the results are provided in section 4. 5 of the present report. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that all resulting fisheries parameters of various fishing effort regimes are downloadable at the requested aggregation in the format of digital Appendixes to the present report at the working group’s web page: [URL] Major findings regarding the regional fishing effort regime evaluations as derived by STECF EWG 13 - 06 are summarized in the following sections, specifically for each of the reviews undertaken and covering new or additional ToR as appropriate...|$|R
