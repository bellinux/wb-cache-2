500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E

2500|$|The views predominating {{among the}} city's {{politicians}} {{and other leaders}} {{turned out to be}} closer to those of The Stranger than the Times. As mayor Greg Nickels put it, [...] "This is not about music, this is not about a party. This was about a guy who decided {{he was going to kill}} people and he had the firepower to do it." [...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That is what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for Chris." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added that [...] "even… former City Attorney Mark Sidran", whom they described as [...] "Seattle's best-known defender of underage dance restrictions," [...] said that [...] "Some tragedies defy any sort of rational response in terms of regulation because they're completely irrational events you can't really predict or prevent." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E
