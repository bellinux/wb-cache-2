A main challenge is represented by the need for accurate sequential positioning of the ablation catheter around each veno-atrial junction to deliver point-by-point radiofrequency energy applications in order to achieve complete and persistent electrical disconnection of the PVs. Imaging integration is a new technology that enables guidance during this procedure by showing a three-dimensional, pre-acquired computed tomography or magnetic resonance image and the relative real-time position of the ablation catheter on the screen of the electroanatomic system.

40|$|The term “shoulder formation” {{refers to}} an {{increase}} of the density decay length in the scrape-off layer (SOL) observed in many tokamaks during L-mode operation when a density threshold is reached.

For this, a cold divertor H-mode scenario is developed in AUG using different levels of D puffing and N seeding, in which inter-ELM filaments and SOL density profiles are measured.

A further 10 % to 20 % of patients may become responsive to previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs. Although the success rate of AF ablation appears high, a very low incidence of complications has been reported including cardiac tamponade, embolism, esophageal injury, PV stenosis, and proarrhythmia resulting from reentrant tachycardias. However, the complication rates can be decreased by more recent modifications to the technique and presently available technologies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{evaluation}} of cracks in PV modules {{is a difficult}} task: cracks do not necessarily lead to a strong degradation in the power output of the module directly after the crack initiation. However, PV modules with cracks suffer from a lower stability of the power output under artificial ageing.

This crack orientation has a high probability of having a potentially separated cell area Acrack of 16 to 24 % and can thus be considered to be of high criticality. We proceed by subjecting 12 of these PV modules to 200 cycles of a humidity-freeze test. A significant part of 29 % of the cracked cells shows an increased resistance across the cracks and 7 % show isolated cell areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{scaling of}} blobs, subject to dissipation by either electric currents to the sheaths, or dynamical friction, is studied by numerical simulations where the blob amplitude {{relative to the}} background plasma is a free parameter. When subject to dissipation by sheath currents, the radial velocity of a blob depends on the square of its cross field size l, vrad ∼ √l for small l. For large l, the radial velocity of the blob scales as vrad ∼ l− 2. The radial blob velocity is maximal for an intermediate size and depends sensitively on the blob amplitude relative to the background density. In the case of dynamical friction, the blob velocity depends on its cross field size as vrad ∼ √l when friction is negligible. For strong friction the blob velocity is inversely proportional to the friction coefficient and size independent. The length scale for the transition between these velocity regimes depends sensitively on the relative blob amplitude. An algorithm to track plasma blobs in spatially resolved optical measurements is developed and applied to gas-puff imaging data obtained from the scrape-off layer of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. For discharges where the line averaged plasma density is small relative to the Greenwald density, ne/nG ≾ 0. 3, the observed radial blob velocities are well approximated by the sheath connected velocity scaling. In the case of ne/nG ≾ 0. 4, the radial blob velocities {{are found to be}} larger than predictions by the sheath connected velocity scaling. Statistical properties of the scrape-off layer plasma in Alcator C-Mod are studied for a series of discharges where the line-averaged particle density was varied. Long time series of the ion saturation current and the floating potential are obtained from Langmuir probes dwelled in the outboard mid- plane scrape-off layer as well as from a set of Langmuir probes embedded in the lower divertor baffle. We find that the waiting times between burst events and the burst amplitudes are approximately exponentially distributed. The exponentially distributed burst waiting times are compatible with the assumption that the individual blob events are uncorrelated. The conditionally averaged burst shapes of the saturation current perturbations and floating potential are similar for both poloidal positions at low line-averaged particle densities. For a discharge with high line-averaged density we find that the electric potential, sampled at the divertor, looses coherence with increasing distance to the last closed flux surface. These results indicate that sheath dissipation is a robust mechanism that governs the dynamics of plasma blobs in Alcator C-Mod at low line-averaged particle densities, while at high densities the blob filaments are <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnect</b> from the sheaths...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} a century of the {{ultimate}} dominance of AC in distribution systems, DC distribution is being re-considered. However, the advantages of AC systems cannot be omitted. This is mainly due to the cheap and efficient means of generation provided by the synchronous AC machines and voltage stepping up/down allowed by the AC transformers. As an intermediate solution, hybrid AC/DC distribution systems or microgrids are proposed. This hybridization of distribution systems, incorporation of heterogeneous mix of energy sources, and introducing Pulsed Power Loads (PPL) together add more complications and challenges to the design problem of distribution systems. In this dissertation, a comprehensive multi-objective optimization approach is presented to determine the optimal design of the AC/DC distribution system architecture. The mathematical formulation of a multi-objective optimal power flow problem based on the sequential power flow method and the Pareto concept is developed and discussed. The outcome of this approach is to answer the following questions: 1) the optimal size and location of energy storage (ES) in the AC/DC distribution system, 2) optimal location of the PPLs, 3) optimal point of common coupling (PCC) between the AC and DC sides of the network, and 4) optimal network connectivity. These parameters are to be optimized to design a distribution architecture that supplies the PPLs, while fulfilling the safe operation constraints and the related standard limitations. The optimization problem is NP-hard, mixed integer and combinatorial with nonlinear constraints. Four objectives are involved in the problem: minimizing the voltage deviation (ΔV), minimizing frequency deviation (Δf), minimizing the active power losses in the distribution system and minimizing the energy storage weight. The last objective is considered in the context of ship power systems, where the equipment’s weight and size are restricted. The utilization of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) in PPL applications is investigated. The design, hardware implementation and performance evaluation of an advanced – low cost Modular Energy Storage regulator (MESR) to efficiently integrate ES to the DC bus are depicted. MESR provides a set of unique features: 1) It is capable of controlling each individual unit within a series/parallel array (i. e. each single unit can be treated, controlled and monitored separately from the others), 2) It is able to charge some units within an ES array while other units continue to serve the load, 3) Balance the SoC without the need for power electronic converters, and 4) It is able to <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnect</b> a unit and allow the operator to perform the required maintenance or replacement without affecting the performance of the whole array. A low speed flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) is designed and implemented to be used as an energy reservoir in PPL applications. The system was based on a separately excited DC machine and a bi-directional Buck-Boost converter as the driver to control the charging/discharging of the flywheel. Stable control loops were designed to charge the FESS off the pulse and discharge on the pulse. All the developments in this dissertation were experimentally verified at the Smart Grid Testbed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the promise}} of {{extremely}} high theoretical capacity (2 Li + O_ 2 ↔ Li_ 2 O_ 2, 1675 mAh per gram of oxygen), many challenges currently impede development of Li/O_ 2 battery technology. Finding suitable electrode and electrolyte materials remains the most elusive challenge to date. A radical new approach is to replace volatile, unstable and air-intolerant organic electrolytes common to prior {{research in the field}} with alkali metal nitrate molten salt electrolytes and operate the battery above the liquidus temperature (> 80 °C). Here we demonstrate an intermediate temperature Li/O_ 2 battery using a lithium anode, a molten nitrate-based electrolyte (e. g., LiNO_ 3 –KNO_ 3 eutectic) and a porous carbon O_ 2 cathode with high energy efficiency (∼ 95 %) and improved rate capability because the discharge product, lithium peroxide, is stable and moderately soluble in the molten salt electrolyte.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter Left Atrial Electrical Disconnection. An effective, catheter-based {{treatment}} for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) remains elusive. This study assessed {{the feasibility of}} transcatheter left atrial (LA) electrical disconnection {{and its effect on}} AF inducibility. METHOD AND RESULTS: Thirteen anesthetized swine underwent noncontact mapping of the right atrium (RA) during coronary sinus (CS) pacing. Sites of earliest RA activation were identified using isopotential maps. An ablation catheter was navigated to these sites and a cluster of radiofrequency (RF) lesions applied until earliest activation shifted to a new site. The procedure was repeated until the atria were <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected.</b> AF induction was attempted before and after ablation. Earliest RA activation was the CS os during proximal CS pacing and Bachmann's bundle during distal CS pacing. These two sites were successfully ablated in all 13 animals. Earliest activation then shifted to the fossa ovalis. RF energy was applied at a median of 2. 5 sites (range 1 to 5) around the fossa, then at sites in the triangle of Koch, septum, cavotricuspid isthmus, and posterior wall. Atrial electrical disconnection was achieved in 10 of 13 animals (5 LA electrical disconnection, 3 RA electrical disconnection, 2 biatrial electrical disconnection with complete heart block). After atrial electrical disconnection, the LA became electrically silent. Before ablation, AF was inducible in every animal. After atrial electrical disconnection, AF was inducible in 3 of 10 animals. CONCLUSION: Atrial electrical disconnection is feasible using noncontact mapping and RF ablation. Successful electrical disconnection of the atria reduces AF inducibility. This approach is worthy of further evaluation as a management strategy for persistent AF, combined with device therapies...|$|E
40|$|In many {{devices such}} as solar cells, light {{emitting}} diodes, transistors, etc., the performance relies on the electronic structure at interfaces between materials within the device. The objective of this work was to perform robust characterization of hybrid (organic/inorganic) interfaces by tailoring the interfacial region for photoelectron spectroscopy. Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) were utilized to induce dipoles of various magnitudes at the interface. Additionally, SAMs of molecules with varying dipolar characteristics were mixed into spatially organized structures to systematically vary the apparent work function. Polymer thin films were characterized by depositing films of varying thicknesses on numerous substrates with and without interfacial modifications. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed to evaluate a buried interface between indium tin oxide (ITO), treated under various conditions, and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT). Conducting polymer films {{were found to be}} sufficiently conducting such that no significant charge redistribution in the polymer films was observed. Consequently, a further departure from uniform substrates was taken whereby <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> regions of the substrate presented ideally insulating interfacial contacts. In order to accomplish this novel strategy, interdigitated electrodes were used as the substrate. Conducting fingers of one half of the electrodes were electrically grounded while the other set of electrodes were electronically floating. This allowed for the evaluation of substrate charging on photoelectron spectra (SCOPES) in the presence of overlying semiconducting thin films. Such an experiment has never before been reported.

40|$|Multilevel {{voltage source}} {{inverters}} have been receiving {{more and more}} attention from the industry and academia as a choice for high voltage and high power applications. The high voltage multilevel inverters can be constructed with existing low voltage semiconductor switches, which already have a mature technology for handling low voltages, thus improving {{the reliability of the}} overall inverter system. These multilevel inverters generate the output voltage in the form of multi-stepped waveform with smaller amplitude. This will result in less dv/dt at the motor inputs and electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by switching is considerably less. Because of the multi-stepped waveform, the instantaneous error in the output voltage will be always less compared to the conventional two-level inverter output voltage. It will reduce the unwanted harmonic content in the output voltage, which will enable to switch the inverter at lower frequencies. Many interesting multi level inverter topologies are proposed by various research groups across the world from industry and academic institutions. But apart from the conventional 3 -level NPC and H-bridge topology, others are not yet highly preferred for general high power drives applications. In this respect, two different five-level inverter topologies and one three-level inverter topology for high power induction motor drive applications are proposed in this work. Existing knowledge from published literature shows that, the three-level voltage space vector diagram can be generated for an open-end winding induction motor by feeding the motor phase windings with two two-level inverters from both sides. In such a configuration, each inverter is capable of assuming 8 switching states independent of the other. Therefore a total of 64 switching combinations are possible, whereas the conventional NPC inverter have 27 possible switching combinations. The main drawback for this configuration is that, it requires a harmonic filter or isolated voltage source to suppress the common mode currents through the motor phase winding. In general, the harmonic filters are not desirable because, it is expensive and bulky in nature. Some topologies have been presented, in the past, to suppress the common mode voltage on the motor phase windings when the both inverters are fed with a single voltage source. But these schemes under utilize the dc-link voltage or use the extra power circuit. The scheme presented in chapter- 3 eliminates the requirement of harmonic filter or isolated voltage source to block the common mode current in the motor phase windings. Both the two-level inverters, in this scheme, are fed with the same voltage source with a magnitude of Vdc/ 2 where Vdc is the voltage magnitude requires for the NPC three-level inverter. In this scheme, the identical voltage profile winding coils (pole pair winding coils), in the four pole induction motor, are <b>disconnected</b> <b>electrically</b> and reconnected in two star groups. The isolated neutrals, provided by the two star groups, will not allow the triplen currents to flow in the motor phase windings. To apply identical fundamental voltage on disconnected pole pair winding, decoupled space vector PWM is used. This PWM technique eliminates the first center band harmonics thereby it will allow the inverters to operate at lower switching frequency. This scheme doesn’t require any additional power circuit to block the triplen currents and also it will not underutilize the dc-bus voltage. A five-level inverter topology for four pole induction motor is presented in chapter- 3. In this topology, the disconnected pole pair winding coils are effectively utilized to generate a five-level voltage space vector diagram for a four pole induction motor. The disconnected pole pair winding coils are fed from both sides with conventional two-level inverters. Thereby the problems like capacitor voltage balancing issues are completely eliminated. Three isolated voltage sources, with a voltage magnitude of Vdc/ 4, are used to block the triplen current in the motor phase windings. This scheme is also capable of generating 61 space vector locations similar to conventional NPC five-level inverter. However, this scheme has 1000 switching combinations to realize 61 space vector locations whereas the NPC five-level inverter has 125 switching combinations. In case of any switch failure, using the switching state redundancy, the proposed topology can be operated as a three-level inverter in lower modulation index. But this topology requires six additional bi-directional switches with a maximum voltage blocking capacity of Vdc/ 8. However, it doesn’t require any complicated control algorithm to generate the gating pulses for bidirectional switches. The above presented two schemes don’t require any special design modification for the induction machine. Although the schemes are presented for four pole induction motor, this technique can be easily extend to the induction motor with more than four poles and thereby the number of voltage levels on the phase winding can be further increased. An alternate five-level inverter topology for an open-end winding induction motor is presented in chapter- 4. This topology doesn’t require to disconnect the pole pair winding coils like in the previous propositions. The open-end winding induction motor is fed from one end with a two-level inverter in series with a capacitor fed H-bridge cell, while the other end is connected to a conventional two-level inverter to get a five voltage levels on the motor phase windings. This scheme is also capable of generating a voltage space vector diagram identical to that of a conventional five-level inverter. A total of 2744 switching combinations are possible to generate the 61 space vector locations. With such huge number switching state redundancies, it is possible to balance the H-bridge capacitor voltage for full modulation range. In addition to that, the proposed topology eliminates eighteen clamping diode having different voltage ratings compared to the NPC inverter. The proposed topology can be operated as a three-level inverter for full modulation range, in case of any switch failure in the capacitor fed H-bridge cell. All the proposed topologies are experimentally verified on a 5 h. p. four pole induction motor using V/f control. The PWM signals for the inverters are generated using the TMS 320 F 2812 and GAL 22 V 10 B/SPARTAN XC 3 S 200 FPGA platforms. Though the proposed inverter topologies are suggested for high-voltage and high-power industrial IM drive applications, due to laboratory constraints the experimental results are taken on the 5 h. p prototypes. But all the proposed schemes are general in nature and can be easily implemented for high-voltage high-power drive applications with appropriate device ratings...|$|R
40|$|The work {{experimentally}} {{determines the}} changes of magnetic {{field in the}} magnetron sputtering system discharge because of electron Hall current near the cathode surface with different magnetic fields. The Hall current was also measured. The magnetic field changes caused by Hall current were determined as a difference of the magnetic field induction values, which was measured with and without electric discharge. The magnet probe measured magnetic field induction changes. This probe had thermal stabilization and was <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> from plasma volume to eliminate the influence of temperature on its sensitivity. Magnetic field was placed normal to the magnet lines. The Hall current value was determined by its simulation with a test coil placed near the cathode surface in the zone of maximum cathode erosion. This test coil caused equivalent changes of the magnetic field. The plasma density has a maximum value {{in the area of}} maximum cathode erosion with the highest magnetic field, which is parallel to the cathode. This assumption allows us to suggest that almost entire Hall current is concentrated in this area. Then, it is possible to replace Hall current effect of magnet field changes for the current in the test coil placed over the cathode surface in the maximum erosion area. The current in the test coil is equal to the total Hall current when this magnetic field change corresponds to the change with discharge available. The experiment has shown that the magnetic field changes caused by Hall current in DC magnetron sputtering system does not exceed 3 % of the external magnetic field value. The Hall current value in magnetron sputtering system with disk-like cathode 4 - 6 times exceeds discharge current. The small value of the Hall current may be {{explained by the fact that}} in the cathode area with the maximum plasma concentration and large values of the magnetic field, the current transport is carried out by ions on which the magnetic field does not have significant influence. The data obtained in this experiment allow us to ignore the changes of magnetic field caused by the Hall current in the theoretical analysis of the plasma parameters in the discharge gap of the magnetron sputtering system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{electronically}} scanned arrays (ESA) {{with high}} efficiency, excellent polarization agility, and wide-scan matching remain essential for servicing multifunctional RF front-ends and other communications, sensing, and jamming or countermeasure systems. To this day, {{the most popular}} antenna array element in modern UWB-ESA systems is the Vivaldi, or flared notch, due to its superior wide-scan wide impedance bandwidth, well-known design guidelines, and practical embodiment versatility. Despite their popularity, these arrays tend to radiate unacceptably high cross-polarization levels, thus encouraging a great research opportunity. This dissertation presents the theory and design of {{a new class of}} UWB-ESAs, termed Sliced Notch Antenna (SNA) arrays, that remedy the high cross-polarization problems in Vivaldi arrays while maintaining their desirable impedance performance. The critical enabling insight of this work lays in revealing the nature of polarization purity or cross-polarization ratio (CPR) degradation in Vivaldi arrays to arise from a highly imbalanced ratio of longitudinal and transverse currents within the element. This work introduces a novel design strategy that intrinsically balances these currents over a UWB operating band, achieving decade-order (10 : 1) bandwidths and low cross-polarization. Moreover, the design approach is simple, intuitive, and can be implemented in a manner that does not inflate cost expenditures. In fact, the proposed topology can facilitate significantly reduced costs and manufacturing times in Vivaldi arrays by permitting <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> elements over {{a large portion of the}} original Vivaldi fin. Following the presentation of the theoretical and operational principles, a few infinite SNA array design implementations are proposed that achieve decade-order bandwidths and low cross-polarization (e. g. active VSWR A single-polarized 19 × 19 SNA array and its Vivaldi counterpart are designed, fabricated, assembled, and measured to comparatively demonstrate similar wideband impedance behavior over a 1. 2 - 12 GHz (10 : 1) operating range that covers near the entirety of four popular RF bands (L, S, C, and X); center embedded element impedance measurements show good agreement with finite array simulations out to θ= 60 ° scans. The SNA array embedded element pattern offers better than 15 dB cross-polarization level improvements over the Vivaldi array out to wide angles in the D-plane. Active finite array scan simulations suggest both arrays closely track the directivity in the principal planes (e. g. less than 0. 5 dB co-polarized gain drop at broadside), while the SNA array offers up to 25 dB improvements in co-polarized gain for non-principal plane scans in and around the D-plane with approximately 15 dB improvement on average over the Vivaldi array in the mid-band and high-band...|$|E
40|$|Microfabricated ion traps are an {{important}} tool {{in the development of}} scalable quantum systems. Tremendous advancements towards an ion quantum computer were made in the past decade and most requirements for a quantum computer have been fulfilled in individual experiments. Incorporating all essential capabilities in a fully scalable system will require the further advancement of established quantum information technologies and development of new trap fabrication techniques. In my thesis I will discuss the theoretical background and experimental setup required for the operation of ion traps. Measurement of the important ion trap heating rate was performed in the setup and I will discuss the results in more detail. I will give a review of microfabrication processes used for the fabrication of traps, outlining advantages, disadvantages and issues inherent to the processes. Following the review I will present my work on a concept for a scalable ion trap quantum system based on microwave quantum gates and shuttling through X-junctions. Many of the required building blocks, including ion trap structures with current-carrying wires intended to create strong magnetic field gradients for microwave gates were investigated further. A novel fabrication process was developed to combine current-carrying wires with advanced multilayered ion trap structures. Several trap designs intended for proof of principle experiments of high fidelity microwave gates, advanced detection techniques and shuttling between <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> ion traps will be presented. Also the electrode geometry of an optimized X-junction design with strongly suppressed rf barrier height will be presented. Further, I developed several modifications for the experimental setup to extend the existing capabilities. A plasma source capable of performing in-situ cleans of the trap electrode surfaces, which has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the heating rate in ion traps, was incorporated. I will also present a vacuum system modification designed to cool ion traps with current-carrying wires and transport the generated heat out of the vacuum system. In addition a novel low-noise, high-speed, multichannel voltage control system was developed by me. The device can be used in future experiments to precisely shuttle ions from one trapping zone to another and also to shuttle ions through ion trap junctions. Lastly I will outline the process optimization and microfabrication of my ion trap designs. A novel fabrication process which makes use of the extremely high thermal conductivity of diamond substrates and combines it with thick copper tracks embedded in the substrate was developed. Large currents will be passed through the wires creating a strong and controllable magnetic field gradient. Ion trap designs with isolated electrodes connected via buried wires can be placed on top of the current-carrying wires, allowing the most advanced electrode designs to be fabricated with current-carrying wires...|$|E
