50|$|This allows fuel to be {{shut off}} from the sprayer by {{electrical}} control. It helps avoid drips when the valve is closed. It also eases the purging of the burner (and any boiler) of <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> during start up, or while restarting after a misfire. If the burner were not purged the oil/air mixture could explode dangerously.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines, unlike {{gasoline}} engines, {{do not use}} {{spark plugs}} to induce combustion. Instead, they rely solely on compression to raise {{the temperature of the}} air to a point where the diesel combusts spontaneously when introduced to the hot high pressure air. The high pressure and spray pattern of the diesel ensures a controlled, complete burn. The piston rises, compressing the air in the cylinder; this causes the air's temperature to rise. By the time the piston reaches the top of its travel path, the temperature in the cylinder is very high. The <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> is then sprayed into the cylinder; it instantly combusts, forcing the piston downwards, thus generating power. The pressure required to heat the air to that temperature, however, requires a large and strong engine block.|$|E

Characteristics of Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) mist is devoted to fuel evaporation, and mixing and combustion quality affected by pressure injection (P) and the physical chemical properties of the fuel (density, surface tension, viscosity and boiling point). From fuel spray test results showed that fuel evaporation characteristics of fuel at a certain pressure effect on engine performance. The higher the injection pressure will reduce the diameter of the <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> after injection (SMD), thus speeding up evaporation and mixing processes between fuel and air in the combustion chamber with resulted the combustion process is more completely...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{enhanced}} {{methods for}} analysing non-linear effects in propagating laminar flames, enabling more accurate evaluation of laminar flame {{characteristics such as}} Markstein length and unstretched flame speed whilst proposing a new method for evaluating extinction stretch rate. Furthermore, a new cloud-combustor is developed and commissioned enabling laminar flame characteristics through droplet <b>fuel</b> <b>mists</b> to be explored again utilising advanced non-linear analysis. Re-analysis of previous low-ignition energy methane-water flames reveals the analytical non-linear characteristic. The analysis also demonstrates {{the need for a}} larger chamber to avoid pressurised effects during the latter stages of propagation, potentially reducing the accuracy of the adopted methodology. Non-linear analysis shows interesting trends concerning Markstein length at higher water loading in particular when it increase to 15...|$|R
50|$|Effective {{ignition}} source {{is a term}} defined in the European ATEX directive as an event which, in combination with sufficient oxygen and <b>fuel</b> in gas, <b>mist,</b> vapor or dust form, can cause an explosion. Methane, hydrogen or coal dust are examples of possible fuels.|$|R

40|$|Research is {{currently}} being undertaken to determine the various physical characteristics of antimisting fuel. It is an endeavor to prevent post-crash <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> fires. The following studies were done: (1) drop and jet breakup studies using an image processing technique, (2) flammability of <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> under simulated plane crash conditions; (3) skin friction measurements; (4) determination of the tensile viscosity of non-Newtonian antimisting fuel {{as a function of}} the extensional rate; and (5) water compatibility measurements. The results indicate that the mechanism which prevents antimisting fuel breakup is related to the time-dependent tensile viscosity of antimisting fuel under stress. Drag reduction phenomenon was also observed at Reynolds numbers higher than 20, 000. Uptake of water by the antimisting fuel is higher than that for the neat fuel. In addition, its rate of absorption depends on the concurrent degree of agitation...|$|E
40|$|For an ultra {{lean mixture}} of liquid fuel (Kerosene) mist and air, {{adiabatic}} combustion technology was studied experimentally using a simple perforated cylindrical hot porous ceramic burner. During the steady lean combustion, high excess air ratios; 2. 8 ～ 3. 6 {{could be achieved}} through the range of fuel now rate; 0. 8 ～ 4 g/min. The emission levels of CO and NOx under the excess air ratios less than 2. 0 were satisfactorily low. The effects of fuel flow rate on the emission levels were examined, and the mechanisms of flame confinement in the perforated cylindrical hot porous ceramic were discussed in detail. It was shown that the adiabatic combustion method of liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> in a hot porous ceramics can be promising combustion technology for many applications owing to the ultra lean mixture condition, the strong light emission and the strong thermal radiation...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{technology is}} employed in most combustion systems, such as internal combustion engines or oil burners. It {{has been well}} known that atomization {{plays an important role}} in combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions — specifically, that a finer <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> allows a more efficient burn of the fuel, resulting in fewer harmful emissions. This is attributed to a fact that combustion starts from the interface between the fuel and air (oxygen). If we reduce the size of the fuel droplets, we increase the total surface area to start burning, boost the combustion efficiency, and improve the emission. There are a couple of new techniques in development to reach this goal. For example, Delphi Company in its long-term project plans to develop a new fuel injector that utilizes a high pressure of 200 bar to reduce the size of fuel droplets to 25 µm in diameter. This injector, called Delphi Multec ™ Direct Injection Gasoline Spray Stratified Injector, requires substantial changes of the fuel lines in vehicles as the current vehicles can only sustain a fuel pressure less than 3 bars [1]. Another possible technique is the electrostatic atomization, which makes all fuel droplets negatively charged [2 - 6]. The droplet size will be small if the charge density o...|$|E
50|$|On March 26, 1939, a Douglas DC-2, {{registration}} NC13727, crashed {{while attempting}} {{to return to the}} airport. The aircraft, operated by Braniff Airways, had just departed when a cylinder on the left engine tore loose from its mounting and caused a tear in the engine cowling. Subsequent drag from the torn cowling resulted in a stall on the wing, and the plane cartwheeled on to the airport grounds, just yards from the safety of the runway. The Captain cut the fuel switches just before impact, but <b>misted</b> <b>fuel</b> from the tanks spread over the hot engines, causing a fire. The Captain, First Officer, and three passengers survived. The flight's Hostess and seven passengers, however, perished in the disaster.|$|R
40|$|A CFD {{model has}} been {{developed}} to predict {{the behavior of the}} flame spread over solid <b>fuels</b> in water <b>mist</b> environment. A coupled analysis involving gas phase and solid fuel is considered using unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations describing the self-sustained flame propagation. Due to the analysis is focused on the mechanism of flame suppression at the flame leading edge, which is explicitly exposed to the mist, finite-rate chemical reaction is taken into account. The equations for water mist and vapor mass fractions are added to the basic flame spread statement, which includes corresponding term describing energy consumption due to water evaporation. Horizontal flame spread over thick fuel beds of polymeric material (PMMA) under water mist suppression has been investigated. The results have shown that self-sustained energy balance in the heat release zone in the flame is highly sensitive to the external energy loss, which in this case is due to water droplet evaporation. Thus, flame struggles against the presence of water mist on the flame leading edge and either continues to propagate with almost the same velocity (as of without water mist), or complete extinction occurs. The extinguishing characteristics of fine water mist with the droplet diameter of the order of 30 microns are investigated. A critical concentrations of initial water mist mass fraction required for extinguishment have been achieved for the various conditions of flame spread phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of a <b>fuel</b> <b>mist</b> resulting from high shear stresses acting on the fuel during violent sloshing and tank rupture under the energy of a crash severely increases the occurrence and intensity of fires in transportation related accidents. In order to minimize such crash-induced fires, adding long chained polymers to diesel fuel was proposed to arrest the break-up of diesel into a fine mist. Such polymers with specifically engineered properties are intended to impart non-Newtonian characteristics to diesel, which would then alter its flow behavior under the applied shear stresses. As {{a first step in}} this direction, calculations are performed to obtain the shear stresses experienced by diesel in a typical diesel engine fuel system. From this, a shear range was identified in which the added polymers should be most active and not affect the normal operation of the engine. In addition, drop impact experiments using high-speed imaging were carried out for diesel to characterize its flow behavior under a wide range of strain rates. Similar tests were performed with other common hydrocarbons to identify an appropriate simulant for diesel. Data generated from these tests enable validation for computer models of diesel drop impacts that are to be developed in the next phase of this project...|$|E
