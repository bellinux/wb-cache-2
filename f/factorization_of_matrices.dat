40|$|Abstract—Matrix {{factorization}} {{methods are}} now widely used to recover 3 D structure from 2 D projections [1]. In practice, the observation matrix to be factored out has missing data, {{due to the}} limited field of view and the occlusion that occur in real video sequences. In opposition to the optimality of the SVD to factor out matrices without missing entries, the optimal solution for the missing data case is not known. In reference [2] we introduced suboptimal algorithms {{that proved to be}} more efficient than previous approaches to the <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> with missing data. In this paper we make an experimental analysis of the algorithms of [2] and demonstrate their performance in virtual reality and video compression applications. We conclude that these algorithms are: i) adequate to the amount of missing entries that may occur when processing real videos; ii) robust to the typical level of noise in practical applications; and iii) computationally as simple as the <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> without missing entries.

Contrary to other approaches, we inherently consider asymptotic rather than finite-length results for transmission over MIMO channels with intersymbol interference. It is shown how the different types <b>of</b> <b>factorizations</b> can be transformed onto a prototype factorization task, which in turn can be solved by first performing an unsorted factorization and then determing the optimal processing order. An easy-to-use iterative algorithm for unsorted spectral factorization and the adjustment of the optimized order in DFE and precoding are explained. Numerical simulations cover the impact of sorted and unsorted spectral factorization on the performance of DFE and precoding schemes. R.

40|$|A perturbed {{functional}} iteration {{has been}} developed to solve nonlinear systems. It adds at each iteration level, unique perturbation parameters to nonlinear Gauss-Seidel iterates which enhances its convergence properties. As convergence is approached these parameters are damped out. Local linearization along the diagonal {{has been used to}} compute these parameters. The method requires no computation of Jacobian or <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices.</b> Analysis of convergence depends on properties of certain contraction-type mappings, known as D-mappings.

We consider the triangular <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> in single-precision arithmetic and show how these factors can be used to obtain a backward stable solution.

40|$|We study {{geodesic}} equations {{for a family}} of right-invariant Riemannian metrics on the group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold.

Local existence and uniqueness results are established by proving smoothness of the geodesic spray. The descending property of the metrics is used to obtain a novel factorization of diffeomorphisms. Analogous to the polar factorization in optimal mass transport, this factorization solves an optimal information transport problem.

40|$|Abstract: The {{last decade}} {{lead to an}} {{unbelievable}} growth {{of the importance of}} social media. One of the most interesting challenges associated with social media is predicting which user is expected to comment which blog. In this paper, we formulate the above task as a link prediction problem in bipartite graphs. Recently, sparse matrix factorization became popular for link prediction. We show that the conventional algorithm for the <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> has great potential to predict new links between blogs and users. However, it fails to capture the true distribution of comments and therefore a straight-forward application of conventional matrix factorization leads to suboptimal predictions that do not even outperform the simple baseline of random predictions in terms of overall precision and recall. In order to alleviate this deciency, we devise a simple technique which improves the eciency of the algorithm substantially...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the approximation of dense block Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrices by sums of Kronecker products. We present an algorithm for efficiently computing the matrix approximation that requires the <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> of much smaller dimension {{than that of the}} original. The main results are described for block Toeplitz matrices with Toeplitz-plus-Hankel blocks (BTTHB), but the algorithms can be readily adjusted for other related structures that arise in image processing applications, such as block Toeplitz with Toeplitz blocks (BTTB) and block Toeplitz-plus-Hankel with Toeplitz-plus-Hankel blocks (BTHTHB). Our work extends the techniques in [11, 15], which consider similar matrices, but with the added restriction that the matrices have a banded/block-banded structure. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by using the output of the algorithm to construct preconditioners for systems from two different applications: diffuse optical tomography and atmospheric image deblurring. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{abstract}} view of symmetric gaussian elimination is presented. Problems {{are viewed}} as an assembly of computational entities whose interdependence is modeled by a graph. An algorithmic transformation on the entities which {{can be associated with}} vertex removal, is assumed to exist. The elimination tree of the symmetric gaussian elimination figures the order in which these transformations are applied and captures any potential parallelism. The inherently sequential part of the computational effort depends on the height of the tree. The paradigm is illustrated by block structured LP problems with nested decomposition and basis factorization approaches, problems of blocked symmetric and unsymmetric systems of linear equations, with respectively blocked Cholesky factorization and blocked gaussian elimination. Contributions are: demonstration of the paradigm expressive power through graph concepts (eliminations sets, elimination chains, etc.); emphasis on patterns of similarity {{in the use of the}} graph concepts and finally an effective parallelization tool for blocked Cholesky <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> arising in time phased or dynamic LP models solved by interior point algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Except some {{extremely}} special cases, signal resampling {{was generally}} considered to be irreversible because of strong attenuation of high frequencies after interpolation. In this paper, we prove that signal resampling based on polynomial interpolation can be reversible even for integer signals, i. e., the original signal can be reconstructed losslessly from the resampled data. By using matrix factorization, we also propose a reversible method for uniform shifted resampling and uniform scaled and shifted resampling. The new factorization yields three elementary integer-reversible matrices. The method is actually a new way to compute linear transforms and a lossless integer implementation of linear transforms with the factor matrices. It can be applied to integer signals by in-place integer-reversible computation, which needs no auxiliary memory to keep the original sample data for the transformation during the process or for “undo ” recovery after the process. Some examples of low-order resampling solutions are also presented in this paper and our experiments show that the resampling error relative to the original signal is comparable to that of the traditional irreversible resampling.

40|$|Abstract — In many disciplines, {{data from}} {{multiple}} sources are acquired and jointly analyzed for enhanced knowledge discovery. For instance, in metabolomics, different analytical techniques {{are used to}} measure biological fluids {{in order to identify}} the chemicals related to certain diseases. It is widely-known that, some of these analytical methods, e. g., LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, provide complementary data sets and their joint analysis may enable us to capture a larger proportion of the complete metabolome belonging to a specific biological system. Fusing data from multiple sources has proved useful in many fields including bioinformatics, signal processing and social network analysis. However, identification of common (shared) and individual (unshared) structures across multiple data sets remains a major challenge in data fusion studies. With a goal of addressing this challenge, we propose a novel unsupervised data fusion model. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) We formulate a data fusion model based on joint <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> and higher-order tensors, which can automatically reveal common and individual components. (ii) We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides promising results in joint analysis of metabolomics data sets consisting of fluorescence and NMR measurements of plasma samples in terms of separation of colorectal cancer patients from controls.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that consciousness {{can be understood as}} a state of matter, "perceptronium", with distinctive information processing abilities. We explore five basic principles that may distinguish conscious matter from other physical systems such as solids, liquids and gases: the information, integration, independence, dynamics and utility principles. If such principles can identify conscious entities, then they can help solve the quantum factorization problem: why do conscious observers like us perceive the particular Hilbert space factorization corresponding to classical space (rather than Fourier space, say), and more generally, why do we perceive the world around us as a dynamic hierarchy of objects that are strongly integrated and relatively independent? Tensor <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> is found to play a central role, and our technical results include a theorem about Hamiltonian separability (defined using Hilbert-Schmidt superoperators) being maximized in the energy eigenbasis. Our approach generalizes Giulio Tononi's integrated information framework for neural-network-based consciousness to arbitrary quantum systems, and we find interesting links to error-correcting codes, condensed matter criticality, and the Quantum Darwinism program, as well as an interesting connection between the emergence of consciousness and the emergence of time.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for the constrained saddle point {{problem with a}} convex-concave function L and convex sets with nonempty interior. The method consists of {{moving away from the}} current iterate by choosing certain perturbed vectors. The values of gradients of L at these vectors provide an appropriate direction. Bregman functions allow us to define a curve which starts at the current iterate with this direction, and is fully contained in the interior of the feasible set. The next iterate is obtained by moving along such a curve with a certain step size. We establish convergence to a solution with minimal conditions upon the function L, weaker than Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of L, for instance, and including cases where the solution needs not be unique. We also consider the case in which the perturbed vectors are on certain specific curves starting at the current iterate, in which case another convergence proof is provided. In the case of linear programming, we obtain a family of interior point methods where all the iterates and perturbed vectors are computed with very simple formulae, without <b>factorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrices</b> or solution of linear systems, which makes the method attractive for very large and sparse matrices.
