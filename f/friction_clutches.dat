In some cases, these disadvantages may lead the contacting surfaces to failure before the expected lifetime. In this work, mathematical models of the <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement).

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a {{calculation}} method for slipping parameters of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> (of the slipping work and time) in tractor gearboxes at various gear overlaps and for different <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> installation on the shafts. The work has used theoretical and experimental research methods: the former were based on methods of analytical mechanics and motion theory of wheeled and tracked vehicles, while the latter assumed testing full-sized prototypes of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in gearboxes. The work has brought the following results: a universal acceleration diagram has been offered for a tractor unit at shifting gears with different overlaps, valid for any relation between the gearing time and friction clutch slipping; based on the mathematical models of acceleration of the tractor unit, we have developed a generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears with different overlaps, at starting off a tractor unit and at bench tests of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in gearboxes. The scientific novelty {{of the work is}} in development of the following: - A theoretical acceleration diagram of a tractor unit with gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps; - A mathematical acceleration model of a tractor unit and friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at gear shifting with different overlaps, and when starting a tractor unit off; - A generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears in the gearbox with different overlaps, when starting a tractor unit off and at bench tests of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in the gearbox. Conclusions: The developed universal acceleration mathematical model for a tractor unit at gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps, and of its acceleration at starting off, allows defining – at the designing stage of gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> – their work and slipping time, and the acceleration time of a tractor unit, which may lead to designing reliable <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> The proposed calculation method of the work of the friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at bench tests allows transferring test results into the operation loading mode, and, therefore, to perform fine-tuning of gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> at bench tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|As the {{friction}} material degradation progresses, the normal contact stiffness of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches,</b> {{measured in the}} pre-sliding (stiction) regime that corresponds to the post-lockup phase, changes as revealed in our previous study. Consequently, change of the contact stiffness can affect the normal-mode dynamic behavior. If this hypothesis holds, condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> can also be monitored based on the change of the normal-mode dynamic behavior. In order to verify the hypothesis, in this study, accelerated lifetime tests (ALTs) were carried out on two paper-based wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> under different operations using an SAE# 2 test setup. The normal-mode vibration signal is measured every 200 duty cycles by using an accelerometer axially mounted on the bearing housing of the clutch. Three parameters that implicitly quantify the overall dynamic behavior, i. e., frequency centre (FC), root mean square frequency (RMSF), and root variance frequency (RVF), are extracted from the vibration signal measured in the post-lockup phase. The plots of these three parameters in function of the duty cycles exhibit clear trends which indicate {{the progress of the}} clutch degradation. These three parameters can therefore be seen as the important ones that may allow us to assess the condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> play a {{critical}} role in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions. It is unavoidable that they progressively degrade and eventually break down while the vehicles are under operational condition. To avoid unexpected failures, a proper condition monitoring tool extended with a lifetime prediction method should be implemented. In order to achieve this, appropriate parameters delivering any information about the failure modes and levels must be determined. This paper presents an experimental investigation on a set of statistical parameters generated from the zeroth- and first-order derivative of time domain pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, to determine the appropriate parameters, often called relevant features, for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> The torsional vibrations are measured by using two Ferraris sensors installed on both input and output shaft of the clutch. The determination of the relevant features is based on an evaluation of the historical trends of the parameters. Clearness and fluctuation level of the historical trends are considered as criteria for selecting relevant features from the generated statistical parameters. The trends of the parameters are extracted from lifetime data obtained from an accelerated lifetime test on a paper-based wet clutch, using a SAE# 2 test setup. This study reveals that the RMS value and Shannon entropy extracted from the first-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, and the kurtosis extracted from the zeroth-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, can be used as relevant features for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
