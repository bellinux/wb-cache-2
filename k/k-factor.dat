Although pipe junctions and fittings are at times considered 2 ̆ 2 minor losses 2 ̆ 2 {{in relation to other}} energy losses in a pipe network, there are cases where disregarding such losses in flow calculations will lead to errors. To facilitate these calculations, energy loss coefficients (<b>K-factors)</b> are commonly used to obtain energy losses for elbows, tees, crosses, valves, and other pipe fittings. When accurate <b>K-factors</b> are used, the flow rate and corresponding energy at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. <b>K-factors</b> are well defined for most pipe junctions and fittings; however, the literature documents no complete listings of <b>K-factors</b> for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine the <b>K-factors</b> {{for a wide range of}} flow combinations in a single pipe cross and the results provide information previously unavailable to compute energy losses associated with crosses. To obtain the loss coefficients, experimental data were collected in which the flow distribution in each of the four cross legs was varied to quantify the influence of velocity and flow distribution on head loss.

40|$|AbstractRecently Alon and Friedland {{have shown}} that graphs which are the union of {{complete}} regular bipartite graphs have {{the maximum number of}} 1 -factors over all graphs with the same degree sequence. We identify two families of graphs that have the maximum number of 1 -factors over all graphs with the same number of vertices and edges: the almost regular graphs which are unions of complete regular bipartite graphs, and complete graphs with a matching removed. The first family is determined using the Alon and Friedland bound. For the second family, we show that a graph transformation which is known to increase network reliability also increases the number of 1 -factors. In fact, more is true: this graph transformation increases the number of <b>k-factors</b> for all k≥ 1, and “in reverse” also shows that in general, threshold graphs have the fewest <b>k-factors.</b> We are then able to determine precisely which threshold graphs have the fewest 1 -factors.

Erosion coefficients (<b>K-factors)</b> of theuniversal soil loss equation (USLE) /revised USLE (RUSLE) model were assigned to 99 mappedUruguayan soil types at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale. This work developed a linear mixed model (LMM) with 79 soils with assigned <b>K-factors,</b> in which the following variables were considered: soiltaxonomy, chemical composition, and parent material. The developed LMM had an R 2 = 0. 86,in which the soil taxonomy (p< 0. 0001), parent material (p= 0. 0174), clay (p= 0. 0005) and sand(p= 0. 017) contents had significant statistical effects. The prediction capacity of this modelwas assessed with 10 soils not previously used in development of the LMM with assignedK-factors.
