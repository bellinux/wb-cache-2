5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) because it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to control (it {{can take over}} an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304Â°C.|$|E
50|$|Though {{cognitive}} interviews {{have been}} shown to yield many positive results, this technique is not without its limitations.

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> {{than it is}} in the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> in non-marine environments.|$|E

5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in ballast tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning ballast tanks <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for double hull ships.|$|E

5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|Trucks are vitally {{important}} to U.S. industry, however, measuring {{the impact of}} trucking on the economy <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> because trucking services are so intertwined with all sectors of the economy. According to the measurable share of the economy that trucking represents, the industry directly contributes about 5 percent to {{the gross domestic product}} annually. In addition, the industry plays a critical support role for other transportation modes and for other sectors of the economy such as the resource, manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade industries.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
