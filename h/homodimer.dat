5|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA <b>homodimer</b> is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS {{response is}} known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a <b>homodimer</b> with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA <b>homodimer,</b> which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{unfolding}} of duck gizzard tropomyosin dimers, αβ, αα, and ββ, {{and of a}} 1 : 1 mixture of αα and ββ <b>homodimers</b> was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both αα and ββ <b>homodimers</b> demonstrated a broad thermal transition with maxima at 37. 4 °C and 44. 6 °C, respectively. However, a sharp cooperative thermal transition at 41. 5 °C characteristic for αβ heterodimer appeared on the thermogram {{of the mixture of}} <b>homodimers.</b> The appearance of this transition was prevented by disulfide cross-linking of polypeptide chains in the <b>homodimers.</b> Thus, DSC studies clearly demonstrate formation of tropomyosin heterodimers during heating of the mixture of <b>homodimers</b> and in agreement with earlier published reports indicate thermally induced chain exchange between tropomyosin dimers...|$|R
40|$|In {{vascular}} endothelial cells, cytokines induce {{genes that}} {{are expressed in}} inflammatory lesions partly through the activation of transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB). Among {{the members of the}} NF-κB/rel protein family, <b>homodimers</b> of the RelA subunit of NF-κB can also function as strong transactivators when expressed in cells. However, the functional role of endogenous RelA <b>homodimers</b> has not been clearly elucidated. We investigated whether RelA <b>homodimers</b> are induced in cytokine-treated vascular endothelial cells. Gel mobility-shift and supershift assays revealed that a cytokine TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) activated both NF-κB 1 /RelA heterodimers and RelA <b>homodimers</b> that bound to a canonical κB sequence, IgκB (immunoglobulin κB), in SV 40 (simian virus 40) immortalized HMEC- 1 (human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line 1). In HMEC- 1 and HUVEC (human umbilical-vein endothelial cells), TNFα also induced RelA <b>homodimers</b> that bound to the sequence 65 - 2 κB, which specifically binds to RelA <b>homodimers</b> but not to NF-κB 1 /RelA heterodimers in vitro. Deoxycholic acid, a detergent that can dissociate the NF-κB–IκB complex (where IκB stands for inhibitory κB), induced the binding of the RelA <b>homodimers</b> to 65 - 2 κB from the cytosolic fraction of resting HMEC- 1. Furthermore, TNFα induced the transcriptional activity of a reporter gene that was driven by 65 - 2 κB in HMEC- 1. These results suggest that in addition to NF-κB 1 /RelA heterodimers, TNFα also induces RelA <b>homodimers</b> that are functionally active. Thus RelA <b>homodimers</b> may actively participate in cytokine regulation of gene expression in human vascular endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Previously we have {{proposed}} a role for Bcl- 3 in facilitating transactivation through kappa B sites by counteracting the inhibitory effects of bound, non-transactivating <b>homodimers</b> of the p 50 subunit of NF-kappa B. Such <b>homodimers</b> are abundant for example in nuclei of unstimulated primary T cells. Here we extend the model and provide new evidence which fulfills a number of predictions. (i) Bcl- 3 preferentially targets p 50 <b>homodimers</b> over NF-kappa B heterodimers since the <b>homodimers</b> are completely dissociated from kappa B sites at concentrations of Bcl- 3 which do not affect NF-kappa B. (ii) Select kappa B sites associate very strongly and stably with p 50 <b>homodimers,</b> completely preventing binding by NF-kappa B. Such kappa B sites are likely candidates for regulation by p 50 <b>homodimers</b> and Bcl- 3. (iii) Bcl- 3 and p 50 can be co-localized in the nucleus, a requirement for active removal of <b>homodimers</b> from their binding sites in vivo. (iv) The ankyrin repeat domain of Bcl- 3 is sufficient for the reversal of p 50 homodimer-mediated inhibition, correlating with the ability of this domain alone to inhibit p 50 binding to kappa B sites in vitro. Our data support the model that induction of nuclear Bcl- 3 may be required during cellular stimulation to actively remove stably bound p 50 <b>homodimers</b> from certain kappa B sites {{in order to allow}} transactivating NF-kappa B complexes to engage.

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress <b>homodimer</b> formation.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} insulin are {{initiated}} by its binding to a receptor {{present in the}} cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits.

The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.|$|E

40|$|The {{four members}} of the ErbB family of {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases are involved in a complex array of combinatorial interactions involving homo- and heterodimers. Since most cell types express more than one member of the ErbB family, it is difficult to distinguish the biological activities of different homo- and heterodimers. Here we describe a method for inducing homo- or heterodimerization of ErbB receptors by using synthetic ligands without interference from the endogenous receptors. ErbB receptor chimeras containing synthetic ligand binding domains (FK 506 -binding protein [FKBP] or FKBP-rapamycin-binding domain [FRB]) were homodimerized with the bivalent FKBP ligand AP 1510 and heterodimerized with the bifunctional FKBP-FRB ligand rapamycin. AP 1510 treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB 1 and ErbB 2 <b>homodimers</b> and recruitment of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins (Shc and Grb 2). In addition, ErbB 1 and ErbB 2 <b>homodimers</b> activated downstream signaling pathways leading to Erk 2 and Akt phosphor-ylation. However, only ErbB 1 <b>homodimers</b> were internalized upon AP 1510 stimulation, and only ErbB 1 <b>homodimers</b> were able to associate with and induce phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Cells expressing AP 1510 -induced ErbB 1 <b>homodimers</b> were able to associate with and induce phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Cells expressing AP 1510 -induced ErbB 1 <b>homodimers</b> were able to form foci; however, cells expressing ErbB 2 <b>homodimers</b> displayed a five- to sevenfold higher focus-forming ability.

40|$|It is a {{well-established}} fact that tetraspanin proteins, {{a large family}} of integral membrane proteins involved in cell motility, fusion and signalling, associate extensively {{with one another and}} with other transmembrane and membrane-proximal proteins. In this study, we present results strongly suggesting that tetraspanin <b>homodimers</b> are fundamental units within larger tetraspanin complexes. Evidence for constitutive CD 9 <b>homodimers</b> was obtained using several cell lines, utilizing the following four methods: (1) spontaneous cross-linking via intermolecular disulphide bonds, (2) use of a cysteine-reactive covalent cross-linking agent, (3) use of an amino-reactive covalent cross-linking agent, and (4) covalent cross-linking via direct intermolecular disulphide bridging between unpalmitoylated membrane-proximal cysteine residues. In the last case, incubation of cells with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2 -bromopalmitate exposed membrane-proximal cysteine residues, thus effectively promoting 'zero-length' cross-linking to stabilize <b>homodimers.</b> Similar to CD 9, other tetraspanins (CD 81 and CD 151) also showed a tendency to homodimerize. Tetraspanin <b>homodimers</b> were assembled from newly synthesized proteins in the Golgi, as evidenced by cycloheximide and Brefeldin A inhibition studies. Importantly, tetraspanin <b>homodimers</b> appeared on the cell surface and participated in typical 'tetraspanin web' interactions with other proteins. Whereas <b>homodimers</b> were the predominant cross-linked species, we also observed some higher-order complexes (trimers, tetramers or higher) and a much lower level of cross-linking between different tetraspanins (CD 81 -CD 9, CD 9 -CD 151, CD 81 -CD 151). In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that tetraspanin <b>homodimers,</b> formed in the Golgi and present at the cell surface, serve as building blocks for the assembly of larger, multicomponent tetraspanin protein complexes...|$|R

30|$|Alternatively, <b>homodimers</b> of CsPI {{may also}} be able to act to specify petals with AtAP 3. As shown, CsPI can form <b>homodimers</b> besides heterodimers.

For example, proteins transformed by Lilium longiflorum PI-like genes LMADS 8 and LMADS 9 can also form <b>homodimers</b> besides heterodimers (Chen et al. 2012). It’s worth noting that flowers of the A. thaliana overexpressed the Lilium longiflorum LMADS 8 / 9 (PI-like) also showed partially transformation of sepals to petaloid organs and <b>homodimers</b> of LMADS 8 / 9 were able to bind to the CArG 1 of AtAP 3 (Chen et al. 2012). Moreover, C-terminal deleted HoPI (PI-like) proteins from Hedyosmum orientale (Chloranthaceae) lost the petal identity function in A. thaliana as they failed to form <b>homodimers</b> (Liu et al. 2013).

Co-transfection and in vitro reconstitution experiments revealed that the complex of p 50 with its precursor p 105 (p 50 -p 105), which was shown to accumulate in the cytoplasm of the pro-B cell lines, is required for induction of DNA binding of p 50 <b>homodimers</b> by BCL- 3. However, we could see no in vivo or in vitro evidence of a BCL- 3 -induced increase in proteolytic processing. Instead, BCL- 3 -mediated reorganization of NFKB 1 subunits was demonstrated in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining clearly demonstrated that the transition from cytoplasmic p 50 -p 105 to nuclear p 50 <b>homodimers</b> was induced by BCL- 3 expression.

The binding protein ModA is in a closed conformation with substrate bound in a cleft between its two lobes and attached to the extracellular loops of ModB, wherein the substrate is sitting directly above the closed entrance of the transporter. The MalFGK2-E structure resembles the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis. It is in a closed conformation where it contains two ATP molecules, sandwiched between the Walker A and B motifs of one subunit and the LSGGQ motif of the other subunit.

The objective {{of this study is}} to understand the evolution of structural and functional features of such heterodimers. Using a non-redundant dataset of 70 such heterodimers of known 3 D structure and an independent dataset of 173 heterodimers from yeast, we note that the mean sequence identity between interacting homologous subunits is only 23 - 24 % suggesting that, generally, highly diverged paralogues assemble to form such a heterodimer. We also note that the functional roles of interacting subunits/domains are generally quite different. This suggests that, though the interacting subunits/domains are homologous, the high evolutionary divergence characterize their high functional divergence which contributes to a gross function for the heterodimer considered as a whole. The inverse relationship between sequence identity and RMSD of interacting homologues in heterodimers is not followed. We also addressed the question of formation of <b>homodimers</b> of the subunits of heterodimers by generating models of fictitious <b>homodimers</b> on the basis of the 3 D structures of the heterodimers. Interaction energies associated with these <b>homodimers</b> suggests that, in overwhelming majority of the cases, such <b>homodimers</b> are unlikely to be stable.
