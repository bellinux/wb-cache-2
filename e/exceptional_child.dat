40|$|AbstractSince {{parents of}} <b>exceptional</b> <b>children</b> {{are exposed to}} the variety of child raising {{stressors}} that impact their psychological functioning, determining factors associated with psychological health of these individuals is an important research endeavour. The aim of the current research was to investigate the relationship between image of God and mental health in parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children.</b> To accomplish the stated goal 168 parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children</b> were selected by means of proportional sampling procedure. The Image of God Inventory (IOG, Lawrence, 1997) and Symptom Checklist 90 -R (SCL- 90 R, Deragotis et al., 1973) were administered on them. Analysis of data revealed that the magnitude of mental health can be predicted from the quality of images of God in parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children.</b> Moreover, data revealed that parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children</b> who had positive image of God were higher in mental health than parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children</b> who had a negative image of God. Authors concluded that positive image of God were associated with mental health in parents of <b>exceptional</b> <b>children.</b> Theoretical implication and practical application of the finding are discussed in the original paper...|$|R

40|$|Mental {{illness is}} an {{all-inclusive}} diagnosis which includes {{many areas of}} abnormal behavior. One of those areas {{is the problem of}} the <b>exceptional</b> <b>child.</b> Probably the most difficult area of "exceptionality," to define and explain neatly, is that of the socially maladjusted and the emotionally disturbed child. A social and/or emotional problem, primarily one of degree, is usually defined as a moderate to marked reduction in to a child's behavioral freedom, which in turn reduces his ability to function effectively in learning or working with others. Because of its vagueness, the term "emotionally disturbed" is extremely hard to understand, and therefore, some prefer to use "maladaptation" or "maladjustment. " Because all three mean about the same thing, they will be used interchangeably throughout this paper. The <b>exceptional</b> <b>child</b> suffers from placement in a regular classroom environment; his ability to concentrate and learn is extremely limited. Therefore, either special schools, special classes within regular schools, or residential units, are beneficial for the child.
