40|$|Specification is {{difficult}}. It {{is often}} the case that the most difficult aspect of specifying is the structuring of the specification to begin with. Adopting an architectural approach can help to alleviate this structuring problem. We have investigated how the formal languages LOTOS and Z can be used to develop specification templates suitable for architecting specifications of distributed systems. The <b>immediate</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> is: where do the architectural concepts come from? We have focused primarily on the work of the current standardisation activity of Open Distributed Processing (ODP). The approach taken there is to provide an object-oriented set of concepts and to use these as the basis for developing a multi-viewpoint approach. A viewpoint may be regarded as an abstraction of the system focusing on some particular aspect, the intention being to help reduce the complexity of the system as a whole.

30|$|The <b>immediate</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> {{is how do}} we {{characterize}} our {{uncertainty about}} the effect of full-day kindergarten program attendance on reading proficiency? This {{is referred to as the}} “elicitation problem”, which has been discussed in detail in O’Hagan et al. (2006), and is beyond the scope of this paper. However, following the discussion given in Kaplan (2014), the general approach to specifying a prior distribution for the causal effect is to consider first what is reasonable to believe about the effect and to further consider the source of our belief. This issue has also been discussed by Leamer (1983) who orders priors on the basis of degree of confidence. Leamer’s hierarchy of confidence is as follow: truths (e.g. axioms) > facts (data) > opinions (e.g. expert judgement) > conventions (e.g. pre-set alpha levels). An interesting feature of this hierarchy, as noted by Leamer, concerns the inherent lack of “objectivity” in such choices as pre-set alpha levels, or any of a number of conventions used in frequentist statistics. Leamer (1983) goes on to argue that the problem should be to articulate exactly where a given investigation is located on this hierarchy. The strength of Bayesian inference lies precisely in its ability to incorporate existing knowledge into statistical specifications.|$|E

We envision that HDR capture and display hardware will soon reach the mass market and become mainstream in most fields, from entertainment to scientific visualization. This will necessarily lead to an extensive redesign of the imaging pipeline. However, {{a vast amount of}} legacy content is available, captured and stored using the traditional, low dynamic range (LDR) pipeline. The <b>immediate</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> is: will our current LDR digital material be properly visualized on an HDR display? The answer to this question involves the process known as reverse tone mapping (the expansion of luminance and contrast to match those of the HDR display) for which no definite solution exists. This paper studies the specific problem of reverse tone mapping for imperfect legacy still images, where some regions are under- or overexposed. First, we show the results of a psychophysical study compared with first-order image statistics, in an attempt to gain some understanding in what makes an image be perceived as incorrectly exposed; second, we propose a methodology to evaluate existing reverse tone mapping algorithms in the case of imperfect legacy content...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in 2 -dimensional systems with a honeycomb lattice and related Dirac-­type electronic bands has exceeded the prototype graphene [1]. Currently, 2 -­dimensional atomic [2, 3] and nanoscale [4 -­ 8] systems are extensively investigated {{in the search}} for materials with novel electronic properties that can be tailored by geometry. The <b>immediate</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> is how to fabricate 2 -­D semiconductors that have a honeycomb nanogeometry, and as a consequence of that, display a Dirac-­type band structure? Here, we show that atomically coherent honeycomb superlattices of rocksalt (PbSe, PbTe) and zincblende (CdSe, CdTe) semiconductors can be obtained by nanocrystal self-­assembly and facet-­to-­facet atomic bonding, and subsequent cation exchange. We present a extended structural analysis of atomically coherent 2 -­D honeycomb structures that were recently obtained with self-assembly and facet-­to-­facet bonding [9]. We show that this process may in principle lead to three different types of honeycomb structures, one with a graphene type-­, and two others with a silicene-­type structure. Using TEM, electron diffraction, STM and GISAXS it is convincingly shown that the structures are from the silicene-­type. In the second part of this work, we describe the electronic structure of graphene-­type and silicene type honeycomb semiconductors. We present the results of advanced electronic structure calculations using the sp 3 d 5 s* atomistic tight-­binding method 10. For simplicity, we focus on semiconductors with a simple and single conduction band for the native bulk semiconductor. When the 3 -­D geometry is changed into 2 -­D honeycomb, a conduction band structure transformation to two types of Dirac cones, one for S-­ and one for P-­orbitals, is observed. The width of the bands depends on the honeycomb period and the coupling between the nanocrystals. Furthermore, there is a dispersionless P-­orbital band, which also forms a landmark of the honeycomb structure. The effects of considerable intrinsic spin-­orbit coupling are briefly considered. For heavy-­element compounds such as CdTe, strong intrinsic spin-­‐orbit coupling opens a non-­trivial gap at the P-orbital Dirac point, leading to a quantum Spin Hall effect [10 -­ 12]. Our work shows that well known semiconductor crystals, known for centuries, can lead to systems with entirely new electronic properties, by the simple action of nanogeometry. It can be foreseen that such structures will {{play a key role in}} future opto-­electronic applications, provided that they can be fabricated in a straightforward way...|$|E
