25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the <b>grooved</b> <b>wheel,</b> made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock.

One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E
2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the <b>grooved</b> <b>wheel</b> bearing {{on the underside of}} the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|E
5000|$|A sheave (...) is {{a pulley}} with a <b>grooved</b> <b>wheel</b> for holding a belt, wire rope, or rope. The <b>grooved</b> <b>wheel</b> spins inside {{the frame of}} the sheave. This allows the wire or rope to move freely {{minimizing}} wear and abrasion on cable. Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or rope, lift loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a great advance in the {{grinding}} process by the development of dressing, lubri-refrigeration and other methods. Nevertheless, all of these advances were gained only for continuous cutting; in other words, the ground workpiece profile remains unchanged. Hence, it becomes necessary to study grinding process using intermittent cutting (grooved workpiece &# 8211; discontinuous cutting), as little or no knowledge and studies have been developed for this purpose, since there is nothing found in formal literature, except for <b>grooved</b> grinding <b>wheels.</b> During the grinding process, heat generated in the cutting zone is extremely high. Therefore, plenty of cutting fluids are essential to cool not only the workpiece but also the grinding wheel, improving the grinding process. In this paper, grinding trials were performed using a conventional aluminum oxide grinding wheel, testing samples made of AISI 4340 steel quenched and tempered with 2, 6, and 12 grooves. The cylindrical plunge grinding was performed by rotating the workpiece on the grinding wheel. This plunge movement was made at three different speeds. From the obtained results, it can be observed that roughness tended to increase for testing sample with the same number of grooves, as rotation speed increased. Roundness error also tended to increase as the speed rotation process got higher for testing the sample with the same number of <b>grooves.</b> Grinding <b>wheel</b> wear enhanced as rotation speed and number of grooves increased. Power consumed by the grinding machine was inversely proportional to the number of grooves. Subsuperficial microhardness had no significant change. Micrographs reveal an optimal machining operation as there was no significant damage on the machined surface...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} performance of grinding wheel {{in terms of its}} internal granular particles and their effect on the surface finish for both soft and hard metals subjected to both dry and wet conditions of use. The study considers the properties of materials of construction including hardness of the granular particles and their size and distributions that affects the grinding wheel efficiency in abrading of soft and hard metal surfaces. Furthermore, in order to improve grinding performance, the mechanism of clogging the cutting surface of the grinding wheel as a function of for example, the surface properties of granular particles and the chips formed during the grinding operation have been considered. Objective of this project is to study the overall sharpness of the grinding wheel in terms of its internal granular particles and their effect on the surface finish for both soft and hard metals at different conditions of use. The properties of materials of construction including hardness of the granular particles that affects the grinding wheel efficiency in abrading of soft and hard metal surfaces have been studied. During this project two novel grinding <b>wheels,</b> namely single <b>grooved</b> and crossed <b>grooved</b> <b>wheels,</b> have been developed and their performance has been compared with a selected commercial grinding wheel, the design of grinding wheels incorporated an innovative surface profile which {{has been shown to be}} capable of taking potentially large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generated high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. The voltage measured by oscilloscope during grinding of different workpiece materials including mild steel, brass and aluminium bars was related to the temperature generated between wheels and workpiece materials. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted with a knowledge of the specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding voltage recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding heat dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. 4 Cutting and contact conditions in the different grinding wheels vary dependent on their surface patterns. This thesis shows how temperature, contact stresses, material removal rates vary with the surface profile, size and orientation of the abrasive particles of the grinding wheel, affecting {{the performance of}} the grinding wheel during the grinding operations. Redesigning grinding <b>wheels</b> by making <b>grooves</b> on surface of wheel, material removal rate was increased and less voltage has been recorded. Also, time for redressing wheels was reduced. The wheel surface of crossed grooves shape showed a significant improvement in grinding of soft materials e. g. aluminium. Finally, the different stress distribution, including von_Mises, principal stresses and shear stresses, in the grinding wheels and the three workpiece bars during the grinding process were investigated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technique. The maximum von-Mises stress value of the brass bar was found to be 173. 2 MPa. Hence the strength of produced grinding wheel calculated as 207 MPa which was extensively higher than the maximum von-Mises stress value obtained from FEA profile, resulting 19. 5...|$|R
