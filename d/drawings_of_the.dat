5|$|Aristotle's {{writings}} on biology, {{the first in}} the history of science, are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, Progression of Animals, Parts of Animals, and On the Soul, as well as the lost <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Anatomies which accompanied the History.|$|E
5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like dog {{was brought}} from the Great St Bernard Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool to thousands of people. This publicised {{the existence of an}} Alpine Mastiff, but <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, Karanj {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship. As no <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damaged portions of the boat were available with the Bombay Dockyard or the Indian Navy, {{it was decided to}} use Kursura, which was already docked at Bombay, as the design template for the metal work, and Karanj was repaired within months, in time to join the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.|$|E
5|$|It was {{completed}} within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le Château des Roches, in Bièvres, Essonne. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo, his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod. Ingres later made <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches {{of their son}} Armand and daughter-in-law, Cécile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.|$|E
5|$|A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is {{the only}} {{reminder}} of the Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once continued on over the bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E

5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. <b>Drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E

5|$|In the {{classical}} {{presentation of a}} three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping circles, the central region (representing elements belonging to all three sets) takes {{the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle. The same three circles form one of the standard <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E
5|$|The {{priests of}} Q'uq'umatz {{were drawn from}} an {{important}} lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was {{likely to have been}} a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq. The temple of Q'uq'umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site show only vegetation where the temple once stood. The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region.|$|E
5|$|The ruins were {{described}} by Guatemalan historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in 1695. Miguel Rivera Maestre published some plans {{and views of}} the ruins in 1834 in his Atlas del Estado de Guatemala ("Atlas of the State of Guatemala"). American diplomat and writer John Lloyd Stephens described the ruins, which he called Patinamit, after he visited Iximche with English artist Frederick Catherwood and in 1840. Catherwood never published any <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site and Stephens reported that the locals had plundered the stone at the site {{for many years in}} order to use it for building materials in Tecpán. French architect Cesar Daly mapped Iximche in 1857.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{several species}} were {{classified}} as congeneric with the dodo, including the Rodrigues solitaire and the Réunion solitaire, as Didus solitarius and Raphus solitarius, respectively (Didus and Raphus being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time). An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, Didus nazarenus, in 1852. Based on solitaire remains, {{it is now a}} synonym of that species. Crude <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red rail of Mauritius were also misinterpreted as dodo species; Didus broeckii and Didus herberti.|$|E
5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first {{took place in}} 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images. Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after his 1968 shooting—which occurred the day before the Bobby Kennedy assassination— to be less significant than that done before it.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E

5|$|Conybeare's {{presentation}} {{followed the}} resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy {{of one of the}} fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning's <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.|$|E
