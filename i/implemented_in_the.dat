5|$|After much {{lobbying}} {{of local}} officials by Rickey himself, the Royals {{were allowed to}} host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus {{became the first black}} player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color line had been <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Black Isle's Torn was a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed for Windows by Black Isle Studios, announced on March 22, 2001 and cancelled in July of that year.

Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine, Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games, such as 3D graphics and real-time camera movement.|$|E

5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an {{additional}} level for the 2004 first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on October 27, 2005, through the Steam content delivery service as a free download to owners of the Microsoft Windows version of Half-Life 2. Lost Coast serves as a technology demonstration, specifically showcasing the high-dynamic-range rendering <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Source engine. The level was designed {{with a variety of}} appropriate environments to emphasize these effects. In addition, Lost Coast was the first video game developed by Valve to allow developers to explain various elements of design as the player progresses through the level.|$|E

5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mayoral election for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
5|$|Part of the National Policy was <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> budget {{presented}} in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs {{were designed to}} protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Persona 4 {{takes place}} in a fictional Japanese {{countryside}} and is indirectly related to earlier Persona games. The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year.

5|$|The Nazis {{implemented}} more anti-tobacco policies {{at the end}} of the 1930s and by {{the early}} years of World War II, the rate of tobacco usage declined. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht, the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. According to a survey conducted in 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|The {{assimilation}} was not {{as strongly}} <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by {{the law of the}} German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, the power structure was completely different, with a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to. Finally, Kexholm and Ingria were sparsely populated and not of great interest.|$|E

It passed its State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in the production line from the 101st I-200.
