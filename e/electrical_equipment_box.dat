40|$|Graduation date: 1998 An AC/AC {{converter}} {{has been}} designed and implemented {{for the purpose of}} providing a modular drive system with a Brushless Doubly-Fed Machine (BDFM.) This converter is to be used in laboratory testing and also as part of a demonstration system in the field. All hardware needed to start and run the BDFM is now consolidated into a single NEMA standard frame <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>box.</b> This allows easy transportation and setup of the drive system, and will enable the BDFM drive system to be directly compared with existing induction machine based drive systems. Converter subsystem overviews {{in the body of the}} text and comprehensive schematics in the appendices of this thesis describe all circuitry included in the drive system. Sufficient construction detail is given to allow for duplication of this converter by qualified technical personnel. While not tailored for mass production, this converter may provide a starting point for a commercially viable design...|$|E

In addition, the term may apply to the minimum distance to railway platforms (passenger or freight), buildings, <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>boxes,</b> railway signal <b>equipment,</b> third rails or to supports for overhead catenaries or overhead lines from the track. The width of a narrow cut can also affect the maximum loading gauge.|$|R

40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} {{the design and}} construction of a race team <b>equipment</b> <b>box.</b> This <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was located on the rear of a modified golf cart. The rear half of the golf cart was modified by creating framework around the rear so that the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> would rest on top {{and be able to}} detach from it. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was able to hold all necessary equipment that is needed in the pits. Each items location was placed ergonomically so they can be reached with ease in an efficient manner. Located {{on both sides of the}} <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> were tires holders. These tire holders swivel 360 degrees so the tires can be sanded. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> has one shelf in it so that there are two areas to store parts. Once the project was completed, a “fit check” was done to make sure the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> could hold all that it needed. It was found that the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> met all specifications put into place and exceeded expectations. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was able to hold over 500 lbs. of equipment and still function properly. It also had an area for a third tire to be held.
