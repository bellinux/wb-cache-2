40|$|Although Japanese {{physicians}} {{historically have}} not disclosed cancer diagnoses to patients, pressures upon physicians to disclose {{have increased in}} recent years. We questioned physicians practicing at a private medical hospital in rural Japan about their current approach to cancer disclosure. We compared their responses with responses of physicians in a 1991 study conducted in Japan, and two studies conducted in the United States, in 1961 and in 1977. Seventy-seven clinically active physicians with experience treating cancer patients responded (73 % response rate). Forty percent of respondents reported usually telling patients of a cancer <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>over</b> <b>three</b> {{times more than the}} 13 % who reported such a policy in Japan in 1991. Physicians were significantly more likely (PJapan cancer disclosure informed consent...|$|E

This clinical entity initially described in 1990, is elusive, with vague and misleading symptoms.

40|$|Abstract Background Brucellosis is an endemic {{infection}} in Georgia. We conducted {{a review of}} patient records with a suspected or confirmed <b>diagnosis</b> of brucellosis <b>over</b> <b>three</b> decades at the central referral hospital for brucellosis cases, the Institute of Parasitology and Tropical Medicine (IPTM) in Tbilisi. The purpose was to describe the demographic profile and clinical characteristics as well as diagnostic and treatment strategies in patients with brucellosis. Methods Data were abstracted from randomly selected patient records at the IPTM. In total, 300 records were reviewed from three time periods: 1970 - 73, 1988 - 89, and 2004 - 2008. Results The age distribution of patients shifted from a median age of 40 years in the first time period to 20 years in the third time period. Azeri ethnicity was an increasing proportion {{of the total number}} of cases. The frequency of relapsed infection was 14. 7 % (44 cases). A total of 50 patients received vaccine therapy, and although the vaccine produced immune responses, demonstrated by an increase in agglutination titers, it was not associated with improved outcome. Conclusion The demographics of brucellosis in Georgia fit a profile of persons that tend sheep. Osteoarticular complications were commonly detected, especially in children. The changing pattern of brucellosis in Georgia suggests clinicians should be updated about different trends in brucellosis in their country. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 University of Washington Abstract HIV Status Disclosure among Older African American Men Who Have Sex with Men and Women Steven C. Simpkins Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Sarah Shannon School of Nursing HIV {{has become}} a chronic illness rather than a {{terminal}} <b>diagnosis</b> <b>over</b> the past <b>three</b> decades. Increasing numbers of HIV infected adults are growing old while continuing to enjoy active sex lives. Older African American men who are HIV infected and {{have sex with men}} and women are an important group to focus on around prevention of HIV infections through disclosure because of their interactions with both genders. Existing theoretical models provide sparse guidance around how older African American (AA) {{men who have sex with}} men and women (MSMW) may experience the process of disclosing their HIV status; specifically, they offer little information about the cultural or community-based experiences that might mediate the disclosure experience for AA MSMW. This study used a directed content analysis approach based on an existing model and the experiences of nine AA MSMW over the age of fifty from a local HIV clinic. It is grounded in the Disclosure Processes Model of HIV status disclosure. Chapter 2 examines the current literature as it applies to HIV status disclosure for older adults, African Americans, and men who have sex solely with men as well as those who have sex with men and women. Chapter 3 explores four models of HIV-status disclosure that sequentially describe the theoretical processes of disclosure that lead up to the Disclosure Processes model. Finally, Chapter 4 presents the experiences of HIV status disclosure of the participants of an online focus group and draws conclusions about these experiences enhance the current theoretical model as it applies to this unique population...|$|R
