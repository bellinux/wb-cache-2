40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} legal systems (LSs) on <b>financial</b> <b>disclosures</b> by firms from different countries. The results indicate that firms from common law countries are associated with higher <b>financial</b> <b>disclosures</b> compared to firms from code law countries.

5|$|In 1992, Burger King and its franchises formed Restaurant Services Inc. (RSI), an {{independent}} purchasing cooperative, which covered 100 percent of BK {{stores in the}} United States. The creation of RSI {{was based on a}} proposal by then-CEO Barry Gibbons create an organization that would be autonomous from BK corporate operations, provide full <b>financial</b> <b>disclosure</b> to participants on pricing issues and revenues, and enjoy the participation of the entire chain to maximize the benefits of volume purchasing. The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner. Two weeks after the formation of the co-operative, Grand Met sold the physical assets of BKDS to Canadian-based buyout firm Onex Corporation and folded BKP into RSI.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater <b>financial</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a <b>financial</b> <b>disclosure,</b> and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House <b>financial</b> <b>disclosure</b> forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the attributes of ownership structure and corporate governance on <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> in Malaysian listed firms’ annual reports over two key periods, 2001 and 2006. Overall, the extent of <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> has significantly increased from 12. 2 per cent to 15. 0 per cent. The highest level of <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> is for the sub-categories of Profitability, Cash Flow and Share Market Measures, whereas there is less information reported for Capital Structure and Liquidity ratios. Further, the analysis shows that the institutional ownership negatively influences the <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> for 2001; and foreign ownership is positively associated with <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> in 2006. Interestingly, family ownership appears to have no significant influence on the disclosure in either period. Ownership concentration, on the other hand has a positive association with <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> in 2001; this is the opposite direction than hypothesised. In addition, the corporate governance attributes have also influenced the <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> in 2001. As for control variables, firm size and profitability are found to have a positive relationship with <b>financial</b> ratios <b>disclosure</b> for both years. These findings provide evidence that the attributes of ownership structure and the implementation of sound corporate governance reduce the information asymmetry between management and stakeholders and therefore, further enhance transparency...|$|R

Individual judges investigated most high-profile corruption cases, but prosecutions were not expected in a number of such cases that began in 2007.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to test the impact of <b>financial</b> {{statement}} <b>disclosure</b> on conservatism in Vietnamese financial statements. I use inter-earning announcement period returns and fiscal year returns to serve as economic news reflected in earnings during the <b>financial</b> statement <b>disclosure</b> period and prior to the <b>financial</b> statement <b>disclosure</b> period. I test conservatism in financial reporting of Vietnamese listed non-financial firms over the period of 2005 - 2015 using the two returns measures in succession. I find that conservatism principle is only ensured within the audited <b>financial</b> statement <b>disclosure</b> period. The findings have implications for our understanding of the role of auditors as well as rules and regulations of <b>financial</b> statement <b>disclosure</b> in improving the quality of accounting information. © 2016, Econjournals.
