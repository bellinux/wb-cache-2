40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the efficiency of}} bracing in 85 patients with anterolateral rotatory instability (ALRI). We were able to compare 18 patients using an antirotational brace with 67 using the AC brace (J. E. Hanger, Mon-treal, Canada). We found the AC brace to offer better overall stability, 71 % compared to 50 %. The physician caring for the athlete with a tear of the ACL has {{to decide whether to}} treat the patient surgically or nonsurgically. In recent years the pendulum has swung from a time when anterior cruciate tears were not thought to be disabling, ’ to {{a time when it was}} thought that surgical reconstruction was the best way to treat functional instabil-ity. ’ Literature is now proving that many patients with an anterior cruciate tear can function quite well without sur-gical repair. 2, 5 5 We reviewed 85 patients with ALRI 6 who had not under-gone any form of anterior cruciate repair. Our goal was to determine the efficacy of bracing to control the ALRI. It had been our experience and that of others that the current braces in use, particularly the antirotational brace, ’ were not adequately controlling the instability associated with an anterior cruciate tear. For this reason, a new brace was designed (Fig. 1). The AC brace relies on a polycentric joint with an <b>extension</b> <b>stop</b> and a pretibial mold to help decrease abnormal tibial rotation and subluxation as the knee ap-proaches extension. The tibial mold also helps prevent the brace from slipping, relying on principles of patellar tendon bearing prosthetics in below the knee amputees. It also provides a broad area upon which the tibial crest can abut as the <b>extension</b> <b>stop</b> comes into play. There is a posterior strap to help prevent the knee from backing out of the brace as it extends. * Address correspondence and reprint requests to L Coughlm, MDCM...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{register}} and report the hand function and occupational performance {{of patients with}} proximal interphalangeal joint-pyrocarbon arthroplasty, using both objective tests and subjective outcome instruments. METHODS: From 2004 to 2008, 53 joints in 43 patients were reconstructed with a proximal interphalangeal joint-pyrocarbon prosthesis. The patients underwent a rehabilitation program allowing early motion with an <b>extension</b> <b>stop</b> to limit hyperextension. Range of motion, grip strength, and pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) were recorded and the subjective outcome was evaluated using Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score. RESULTS: Seven patients were reoperated on (2 infections, 2 arthrodesis, 2 tenolysis, and 1 hyperextension). Pain (VAS) at rest improved from 3. 1 cm preoperatively to 0. 4 cm (p <. 001) and pain (VAS) at activity from 6. 2 to 2. 0 cm (p <. 001) at the latest follow-up (mean, 24 months; minimum, 12 months [+/- 2 weeks]). Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score improved from a median of 39 to 29 (p =. 026). The COPM subjective measurement of occupational performance, improved from a median of 4. 6 preoperatively to 5. 9 (p =. 013) at the latest follow-up, and the COPM, measurement of satisfaction improved from a median of 3. 8 to 5. 9 (p =. 002). Range of motion and grip strength were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: All patients reported decreased pain, and although we found no improvement in range of motion and grip strength, one third of patients reported a clinically significant improvement in occupational performance and satisfaction. A total of 13 % of the joints required a secondary surgical procedure. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{dynamically}} examine various offset angles on the N-K table to determine which offset produces a torque pattern corresponding most closely to the isokinetic torque curve of the knee flexor musculature when tested at 60 %. Subjects for the study were five college-age male volunteers (age= 21. 8 ± 1. 8 yrs, ht= 181. 9 ± 4. 3 cm, wt= 88. 4 ± 12. 6 kg). Mean peak isokinetic torque values for the five subjects were measured at 5 ° increments to represent the human knee flexor torque curve. These were converted to relative mean values by dividing each value by the maximum mean peak torque. Torque curves from four offset angles (90 °, 110 °, 135 °, and 160 °) for the N-K table were obtained by using the Kin Com in the passive mode at 20 °/s to push the exercise arm of the N-K table through a range of motion of 0 ° to 90 ° while recording torque and angular position. The four torque curves were converted to relative values in a similar manner as for the subjects. Qualitative analysis reveals that the 160 ° offset angle most closely corresponded to the representative knee flexor isokinetic torque curve, while the 90 ° offset angle corresponded least. Although these findings would seem to support reconsideration of common clinical practice relative to the use of the N-K table for knee flexor strength development, the 160 ° offset angle is awkward because it has a tendency to force the user into hyperextension at the beginning phase of motion. As such, practical compromises might include the use of the 110 ° or 135 ° offset angle in lieu of the traditionally employed 90 ° offset angle, or the development of an <b>extension</b> <b>stop</b> that would prevent hyperextension of the knee...|$|E

30|$|Kuzumaki et al. (2017) {{reported}} that a strong traction force applied to the tendon gel can form thick fibers. Considering these reports, {{it is thought that}} the thick fibers are more resistant to tension, and {{there is a possibility that}} the results in D 15 and D 20 would change if a strong force within the range that does not break the tendon gel is applied in D 15 and D 20. In D 10, <b>extension</b> <b>stopped</b> 12  h after the application of a traction force of 24.5 [*]×[*] 10 −[*] 4  N. In contrast, <b>extension</b> <b>stopped</b> within 5  min after the application of a traction force in D 15 and D 20. We assumed that <b>extension</b> <b>stops</b> when the tendon gel becomes resilient to a traction force. While it is generally considered that the physical stability of collagen fibers is more affected by intermolecular cross-links than by intramolecular cross-links, collagen fibers are more strongly bound together when more fibers are cross-linked than when collagen molecules are larger (Graham et al., 1984; Klein et al., 2001). Moreover, Kuhn (1987) {{reported that}} the cross-linking of collagen fibrils lends tensile strength to tendons, whereas Kwansa et al. (2014) indicated that the application of a traction force promotes cross-linking between the amino and carboxy I terminals of the collagen fibers, which structurally strengthen the collagen tissue. Furthermore, mechanical stress is essential for the maturity of collagen fibers (Urschel et al., 1988). Similarly, Kuzumaki et al. (2017) reported that when the cross-linking reaction progressed, collagen bundles were formed by a Schiff-base cross-linking reaction, and the bundle became thicker over time.|$|R

40|$|Sites of {{oxidative}} DNA {{damage in}} functioning mitochondria {{have been identified}} using a rhodium photooxidant as a probe. Here we show that a primer extension reaction {{can be used to}} monitor oxidative DNA damage directly in functioning mitochondria after photoreaction with a rhodium intercalator that penetrates the intact mitochondrial membrane. The complex [Rh(phi) _ 2 bpy]Cl_ 3 (phi = 9, 10 -phenanthrenequinonediimine) binds to DNA within the mitochondria and, upon irradiation, initiates DNA oxidation reactions. Significantly, piperidine treatment of the mitochondria leads to protein-dependent primer <b>extension</b> <b>stops</b> spaced every ∼ 20 base pairs. Hence, within the mitochondria, the DNA is well covered and packaged by proteins. Photolysis of the mitochondria containing [Rh(phi) _ 2 bpy]^(3 +) leads to oxidative DNA damage at positions 260 and 298; both are mutational hot spots associated with cancers. The latter position is the 5 ‘-nucleotide of conserved sequence block II and is critical to replication of the mitochondrial DNA. The oxidative damage is found to be DNA-mediated, utilizing a charge transport mechanism, as the Rh binding sites are spatially separated from the oxidation-prone regions. This long-range DNA-mediated oxidation occurs despite protein association. Indeed, the oxidation of the mitochondrial DNA leads not only to specific oxidative lesions, but also to a corresponding change in the protein-induced stops in the primer extension. Mitochondrial DNA damage promotes specific changes in protein−DNA contacts and is thus sensed by the mitochondrial protein machinery...|$|R

See also: [URL] [URL] Guercif {{basin of}} {{northern}} Morocco occupies a 50 x 60 km {{area where the}} transpressional Middle Atlas mountains terminate and abut the Rif thrust belt. Analysis of over 800 km of 2 -D (two-dimensional) seismic reflection profiles and eight exploratory wells, in combination with existing geological data, suggests a late Miocene episode of extension (4 %, or 1. 7 km, maximum) and a subsequent episode of contraction {{since the end of}} the Miocene. Most of the late Miocene deposition was concentrated in a narrow graben (herein referred to as the Guercif graben), which contrasts with the wider physiographic expression of the basin today. Geohistory analysis indicates that tectonic subsidence persisted until the Messinian, and sediment loading continued to drive subsidence even after <b>extension</b> <b>stopped.</b> Timing constraints demonstrate the contemporaneity of the Guercif graben and west-southwest-vergent thrust tectonics of the Rif thrust belt. Similar timing and proximity with the Rif, as well as the graben geometry, suggest that extension in the Guercif basin, in addition to other smaller extensional basins in the northern Middle Atlas region adjacent to the Rif, may represent the distal effects of a broad lateral shear zone bounding the thrust belt. The Neogene Guercif basin is superimposed on the Mesozoic Middle Atlas rift, which experienced basin inversion during the Cenozoic, and seismic reflection interpretations in the southern Guercif basin depict old Mesozoic rift faults reactivated as reverse faults. Unconformities illustrate that the uplift of the Middle Atlas appears to be primarily a late Cenozoic phenomenon. The Guercif basin offers a special opportunity for petroleum exploration within an aborted rift basin such as the Middle Atlas. Mesozoic source rocks in the Middle Atlas may have been sufficiently buried beneath Neogene basin sediments to reach maturity, and the late Cenozoic timing of contraction can produce suitable structural traps...|$|R
