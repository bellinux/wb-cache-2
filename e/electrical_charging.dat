25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An <b>electrical</b> <b>charging</b> ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{establishing}} {{correlation between}} the nature of <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> of morocan stevensite Jbel Rhassoul clay particles and ionic dyes adsorption phenomenon. The <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of the clay mineral particles were assessed by measuring zeta potential (z) using micro electrophoresis technique. Measurements were carried out onto aqueous clay dispersions by varying the pH in the range 2. 5 – 12 with additions of HCl or NaOH. On the whole, the <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of stevensite particles remain negative in the whole pH range. Nevertheless, depending on the pH values, two behaviours were observed. For pH ranging from 2 to around 8, the negative <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> remains constant (z = - 20 mV) and corresponds to permanent charges of basal surfaces formed of –O-Si-O- groups insensitive to pH variation. Beyond pH = 8, the <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> increases (z = - 35 mV) {{as a result of}} deprotonation of silanol edge groups. Ionic dyes adsorption experiments show that anionic orange G adsorption is negligible whereas that of cationic methylene blue is greater due to columbic interactions. In accordance with eletrokinetic measurements, the methylene blue adsorption capacity onto stevensite particles significantly increases beyond pH » 8 due to the increase of the whole <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> of stevensite particles evolved by silanol edge sites deprotonation...|$|R

Local architects have noted how the occupiers re-purposed the square from the roadway and adapted it to functional use; they created ad hoc architecture, such as barricades, supply infrastructure, recycling stations cinemas and libraries.

40|$|Background: Low density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) particles {{have shown}} to be heterogeneous structures with distinctive <b>electrical</b> <b>charges.</b> Alteration in the fatty acids content of the LDL particles is known to affect their structural features, <b>electrical</b> <b>charges,</b> and ultimately physiologic properties and, in this way, {{may play a role}} in the pathology of coronary artery disease (CAD). On the basis of evidences, in the present study, the relationship of fatty acids content of LDL particles and their <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> was assessed in patients with CAD in comparison with control subjects. Methods: In the current case- control study, from subjects who referred to the Mostafa Khomeini Hospital in Ilam during a time period from December 2013 to October 2014, 40 CAD patients and 40 control subjects were selected based on the clinical and angiographic parameters. The fatty acids content and <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of LDL particles were measured by using a gas chromatography system, equipped with a flame ionization detector GC-FID, Acme 6000 M (Young Lin Co., Korea) as well as a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), respectively. Results: In the present study, CAD patients and control subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of LDL particles in the patients group was significantly lower than those in the control subjects (P= 0. 0001). There was an inverse correlation between the <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of the LDL particles and the saturated fatty acids as well as linoleic acid contents of them in CAD patients group. However, we found a direct correlation between the unsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids and some of the polyunsaturated ones) content of the LDL particles and their <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts (P= 0. 02). Conclusion: Results of the present study demonstrated that the increased saturated fatty acids as well as the linoleic acid contents of the LDL particles are associated with decreased <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of these particles and this situation may engage in pathogenesis of CAD...|$|R

5000|$|... ===Proposed SES {{propagation}} mechanism=== An {{analysis of}} the propagation properties of SES in the Earth’s crust showed {{that it is impossible}} that signals with the amplitude reported by VAN could have been generated by small earthquakes and transmitted over the several hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station. [...] In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or <b>electrical</b> <b>charging</b> of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an {{analysis of the}} SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly from the real situation since Earth's crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically appreciably more conductive than the surrounding medium, VAN believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN. Susan Hough noted that this amounted to special pleading, making VAN's hypothesis un-falsifiable because it relies on unrepeatable circumstances.|$|E
