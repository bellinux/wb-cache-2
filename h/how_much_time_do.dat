60|$|Mr Plornish {{did not see}} his road to {{any comment}} on this fact, and made none. As there truly was no reason why he should have the least {{interest}} in it, Arthur Clennam {{went on to the}} present purport of his visit; namely, to make Plornish the instrument of effecting Tip's release, with as little detriment as possible to the self-reliance and self-helpfulness of the young man, supposing him to possess any remnant of those qualities: without doubt a very wide stretch of supposition. Plornish, having been made acquainted with the cause of action from the Defendant's own mouth, gave Arthur to understand that the Plaintiff was a 'Chaunter'--meaning, not a singer of anthems, but a seller of horses--and that he (Plornish) considered that ten shillings in the pound 'would settle handsome,' and that more would be a waste of money. The Principal and instrument soon drove off together to a stable-yard in High Holborn, where a remarkably fine grey gelding, worth, at the lowest figure, seventy-five guineas (not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to swallow for the improvement of his form), was to be parted with for a twenty-pound note, in consequence of his having run away last week with Mrs Captain Barbary of Cheltenham, who wasn't up to a horse of his courage, and who, in mere spite, insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum: or, in other words, on giving him away. Plornish, going up this yard alone and leaving his Principal outside, found a gentleman with tight drab legs, a rather old hat, a little hooked stick, and a blue neckerchief (Captain Maroon of Gloucestershire, a private friend of Captain Barbary); who happened to be there, in a friendly way, to mention these little circumstances concerning the remarkably fine grey gelding to any real judge of a horse and quick snapper-up of a good thing, who might look in at that address as per advertisement. This gentleman, happening also to be the Plaintiff in the Tip case, referred Mr Plornish to his solicitor, and declined to treat with Mr Plornish, or even to endure his presence in the yard, unless he appeared there with a twenty-pound note: in which case only, the gentleman would augur from appearances that he meant business, and might be induced to talk to him. On this hint, Mr Plornish retired to communicate with his Principal, and presently came back with the required credentials. Then said Captain Maroon, 'Now, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>do</b> you want to make the other twenty in? Now, I'll give you a month.' Then said Captain Maroon, when that wouldn't suit, 'Now, I'll tell what I'll do with you. You shall get me a good bill at four months, made payable at a banking-house, for the other twenty!' Then said Captain Maroon, when THAT wouldn't suit, 'Now, come; Here's the last I've got to say to you. You shall give me another ten down, and I'll run my pen clean through it.' Then said Captain Maroon when THAT wouldn't suit, 'Now, I'll tell you what it is, and this shuts it up; he has used me bad, but I'll let him off for another five down and a bottle of wine; and if you mean done, say done, and if you don't like it, leave it.' Finally said Captain Maroon, when THAT wouldn't suit either, 'Hand over, then!'--And in consideration of the first offer, gave a receipt in full and discharged the prisoner.|$|E

Assume that s and t are both over an integer {{alphabet}} [σ], where the first string contains n non-zero entries. We would wish to answer to the following basic question. Assuming that s and t differ in at most k positions, how many bits does player A need to send to player C so that he can recover s with certainty? Further, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> player A need to spend to compute the sent bits and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> player C need to recover the string s? This problem has a certain number of applications, for example in databases, where each of the two parties possesses a set of n key-value pairs, where keys are from the universe [u] and values are from [σ] and usually n≪ u. In this paper, we show a time and message-size optimal Las Vegas reduction from this problem to the problem of systematic error correction of k errors for strings of length Θ(n) over an alphabet of size 2 ^Θ(σ+ (u/n)). The additional running time incurred by the reduction is linear randomized for player A and linear deterministic for player B, but the correction works with certainty. When using the popular Reed-Solomon codes, the reduction gives a protocol that transmits O(k(u+σ)) bits and runs in time O(n·polylog(n) (u+σ)) for all values of k. The time is randomized for player A (encoding time) and deterministic for player C (decoding time). The space is optimal whenever k≤ (uσ) ^ 1 -Ω(1). Comment: 14 pages.

The author proposes four main research questions. Question no. 1 : <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> Saturday Night Live devote to political satire?

At the same time, the author tries to determine whether the show could through its political satire influence attitudes or even electoral behavior of its spectators.

We also investigate the underlying mechanism and demonstrate that (1) people have a lay belief that they spend more (less) time on more (less) pleasant events and (2) unpacking increases the intensity of predicted consumption experience. We further show that these changes in time predictions influence consumption decisions and address alternative explanations, including mood, mood regulation, and attention.

40|$|The {{delay time}} {{associated}} with a scattering process {{is one of the}} most important dynamical aspects in quantum mechanics. A common measure of this is the Wigner delay time based on the group velocity description of a wave-packet, which my easily indicate super-luminal or even negative times of interaction that are unacceptable. Many other measures such as dwell times have been proposed, but also suffer from serious deficiencies, particularly for evanescent waves. One important way of realising a timescale that is causally connected to the spatial region of interest has been to utilize the dynamical evolution of extra degrees of freedom called quantum clocks, such as the spin of an electron in an applied magnetic field or coherent decay or growth of light in an absorptive or amplifying medium placed within the region of interest. Here we provide a review of the several approaches developed to answer the basic question - <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> a quantum particle (or wave) spend in a specified region of space? While a unique answer still evades us, important progress has been made in understanding the timescales and obtaining positive definite times of interaction by noting that all such clocks are affected by spurious scattering concomitant with the very clock potentials, however, weak they be and by eliminating the spurious scattering.
