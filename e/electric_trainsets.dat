5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, <b>electric</b> <b>trainsets</b> are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
500|$|The Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP) will {{electrify}} {{the entire}} [...] right-of-way {{owned by the}} Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (PCJPB), which extends from the San Francisco terminus at 4th and King to a power substation south of Tamien Station. New electrical infrastructure includes installation of approximately [...] of 25kV 60Hz single-phase AC overhead contact lines and ten new power stations (two traction power stations, a switching station approximately halfway along the line, and seven paralleling stations). Land totaling [...] will be acquired from private property owners along the Peninsula Corridor in order to set up safety buffer zones between the overhead contact system and public property; PCJPB authorized eminent domain proceedings in July 2017 in case negotiations break down. Barriers will be installed where road and pedestrian bridges cross over tracks to prevent damage to the electrical wires. New <b>electric</b> <b>trainsets</b> will be purchased for use on the new electrified segment, while service from Tamien to Gilroy station, which is not planned to be electrified, {{will continue to be}} served with existing diesel locomotives.|$|E
