After completing a five-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, Voight became a teaching assistant there while pursuing his master's degree. He then studied at Cornell University for a year before transferring to Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in geology in 1965. Voight worked {{as a professor of}} geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005; he remains an emeritus professor there.

5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and <b>disaster</b> <b>prevention</b> work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E

Due to various production categories, the <b>disaster</b> <b>preventions</b> for high risk operations are variable, some are difficult and some are easy. Thus, it makes the <b>disaster</b> <b>preventions</b> difficult in the science park; it needs desperately the stationed factories {{to carry out a}} systematic, automatic and strict control method to indeed prevent disasters. It is also the highest standard for the plant operations to achieve a construction worry-free working site but it is still the target for the stationed factories on the science park to work on placing the work safety in the standard operation procedure. Based upon the administration circulation concept, this study proposed the administrative system for the high risk operations to be used on the science park, and this system is divided into four stages which include plan, execution, examination, and correction. Moreover, it also takes a science park as an example to exhibit the execution result of this system which could be referred to by other science parkin performing the administration of high risk operations...|$|R

We carried out a field survey using Digi-pulse, air-knocker hit, and a truck running vibrations in tunnel. A survey line with 96 receivers was located on the top of hill just above the tunnel. Obtained subsurface images are clear enough to identify subsurface structures. Our experimental results strongly support applicability of the seismic interferometry to subsurface imaging from the passive data of the noise by social activities. The interferometric imaging will be useful in site characterization for applications in civil engineering, environment, and <b>disaster</b> <b>preventions.</b> ...|$|R
