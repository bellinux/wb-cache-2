One of <b>his</b> <b>key</b> roles in that position was to promote Astraeus' services by increasing their number of videos, leading to the UK Civil Aviation Authority releasing a video featuring Dickinson on aircraft loading safety in June 2011.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by his mother, Hatfield's first {{experience}} with politics came {{at the age of}} 10, when he campaigned in his neighborhood for President Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. In the late 1930s Hatfield worked as a tour guide at the new Oregon State Capitol Building in Salem, using <b>his</b> <b>key</b> to enter the governor's office, where he sat in the governor's chair.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, he {{was elected}} to serve as the clerk of court for Hampshire County {{following}} the retirement of Gabriel Jones, who had been appointed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

Because of <b>his</b> <b>key</b> position as clerk, Wodrow performed {{a significant role in the}} conveying and settling of lands in Hampshire County.|$|E
50|$|The word {{may be used}} amongst {{friends in}} an affectionate way and {{is used as a}} vernacular noun to imply that one is very fond of {{something}} (I'm a bugger for Welsh cakes).

5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan did {{not seek}} to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music {{at the service of}} literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with <b>his</b> <b>key</b> instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough's {{weakness}} during Anne's reign {{lay in the}} English political scene. His {{determination to}} preserve {{the independence of the}} Queen's administration from control of party faction initially enjoyed full support, but once royal favour turned elsewhere, the Duke, like <b>his</b> <b>key</b> ally Godolphin, found himself isolated; first becoming little more than a servant of the Whigs, then a victim of the Tories.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Towton {{was fought}} during the English Wars of the Roses on 29 March 1461, {{near the village}} of Towton in Yorkshire. It brought about a change of monarchs in England, with the victor, the Yorkist Edward, Duke of Yorkwho became King Edward IV (1461–1483) having {{displaced}} the Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422–1461) as king, and thus drove the head of the Lancastrians and <b>his</b> <b>key</b> supporters out of the country.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Robert Morris MBE (19 January 1922 – 22 August 2015) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} 46 Test matches between 1946 and 1955. An opener, Morris is {{regarded}} as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. He is best known for <b>his</b> <b>key</b> role in Don Bradman's Invincibles side, which made an undefeated tour of England in 1948. He was the leading scorer in the Tests on the tour, with three centuries. His efforts in the Fourth Test at Headingley helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day. Morris was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given <b>his</b> <b>key</b> ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of <b>his</b> <b>key</b> repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E

5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish <b>his</b> <b>key</b> to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} {{adopted a}} defensive posture {{similar to that}} of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending <b>his</b> <b>key</b> castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.|$|E
5|$|Selke {{retired in}} 1964 and was succeeded by Sam Pollock. Often named the best general manager in NHL history, Pollock led the Canadiens to nine Stanley Cup championships in his 14 {{years at the}} helm of the team. One of <b>his</b> <b>key</b> tactics was trading aging stars to {{expansion}} teams for draft picks, which led to the team drafting future Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson and Ken Dryden. The Canadiens won consecutive titles in 1965 and 1966, and entered the 1967 Stanley Cup Final against Toronto as a heavy favourite. The City of Montreal was so confident in the Canadiens that they had already built a space for the Stanley Cup on the Expo 67 site, but the Canadiens fell to the Maple Leafs, in the last NHL finals of the Original Six era.|$|E

5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom. His department, the chancery, {{was responsible for the}} Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. <b>His</b> <b>key</b> responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E
5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and <b>his</b> <b>key</b> supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by James Ballantine (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of Dunfermline Abbey and the scheme for St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by Daniel Cottier (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin. <b>His</b> <b>key</b> works included the Baptism of Christ in Paisley Abbey (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist Christopher Dresser (1834–1904) {{was one of the}} first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{interviews}} helped improve Nixon's financial position—at {{one point}} in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank—as did the sale of <b>his</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo. In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao. Nixon had wanted to return to China, but chose to wait until after Ford's own visit in 1975. Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan. Ford won, but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election. The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan that}} Ostojić drew up {{called for the}} Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans. However, this {{essentially}} defensive strategy was rejected by Herzegovinian Chetnik commanders such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Bajo Stanišić, who wished to follow the Axis-led offensive strategy. This placed Ostojić {{in a very difficult}} position, with some of <b>his</b> <b>key</b> detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his, while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian air and artillery support, particularly around Jablanica. Ostojić subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans, launching an attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943. The attack was indecisive and Ostojić reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible, particularly Stanišić.|$|E
5|$|William Henry Meredith (30 July 1874– 19 April 1958) was a Welsh {{professional}} footballer. He {{was considered}} one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for Manchester City and Manchester United. He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and <b>his</b> <b>key</b> skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly recognisable.|$|E
