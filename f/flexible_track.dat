25|$|Before the First World War, {{mechanic}} Charles Marius Fouché {{cooperated with}} engineer Édouard Quellennec and the latter's son Jacques Quellennec to adapt existing caterpillar tractors {{to the conditions}} of Egyptian and French farming, among them the Holt Model 75. In this context in 1914 contacts were made with engineer Eugène Brillié of Schneider & Co. to adapt the Castéran <b>Flexible</b> <b>Track</b> Tractor. When that year war broke out, Jacques Quellennec was drafted as an infantry sergeant, witnessed most men of his unit being slaughtered during the First Battle of the Marne and was then severely wounded {{at the end of}} October. While recovering, he devised plans for an armoured tractor armed with a machine-gun and capable of destroying German machine-gun nests. Many in this period had comparable ideas but contrary to most, Quellennec had excellent contacts. Fouché had become a second lieutenant with the Grand Parc Automobile de Réserve of the Service Automobile, the Army branch responsible for motorisation, and Brillié was chief designer with one of France's main arms manufacturers. Early December, Quellennec met Fouché in Paris and both then went to Brillié to present drawings of a tracked armoured fighting vehicle. During a second visit Quellennec urged Brillié to bring over two Holt Model 75 tractors, at that time present in Tunisia, to France in order to perform the first trials. Brillié showed himself less than enthusiastic about the idea, objecting there would be not enough room on a tractor for both crew and armament. In February 1915, Quellennec was sent to an air force training base and tasked Fouché with trying to convince Brillié, without much apparent success.|$|E

40|$|Graph {{cuts have}} proven to be {{powerful}} tools in image segmentation. Previous graph cut research has proposed methods for cutting across large graphs constructed from multiple layered video frames, resulting in an object being tracked across multiple frames. However, this research focuses on cutting graphs constructed from a prerecorded video sequence. In live video scenarios, frames cannot be layered to construct 3 D volumes, since the contents of the subsequent frames are unknown. Instead, new graphs must be created and cut for each frame on demand. Resource limitations make this unfeasible on high-resolution videos. In addition, object tracking requires a method for incorporating the previous frame’s object position and shape into the current graph. We propose a method for tracking and segmenting objects in live video that utilizes regional graph cuts and object pixel probability maps. The regionalization of the cuts around the tracked object will increase the speed of the tracker, and the object pixel probability maps will enable more <b>flexible</b> <b>tracking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of low-cost and <b>flexible</b> <b>tracking</b> systems for hand and body movements is increasing. With this, more thorough investigations for more natural and efficient physical interaction styles are required which take particular limitations of such systems into account, {{such as the}} limited ability to track individual fingers. To contribute to this, we describe an investigation of basic hand gestures for the exploration of large information spaces. A set of four pan-and-zoom alternatives using two-handed gestural controls have been implemented and compared using Google Earth as an example. For this we conducted a small-scaled formative user study with nine participants to fundamentally assess users' acceptance and the qualification of these freehand gestures for pan-and-zoom operations. As a result, a simple forward and backward hand movement for zooming and a joystick metaphor for panning yielded in the best overall results. Especially the seamless integration of continuous pan and zoom was positively highlighted by participants. ...|$|R

50|$|Subsequently, Steve Jr. {{engineered}} the stapling of rail to fiber track, along with inventing the first practical rail joiner and pre-assembled turnouts and <b>flexible</b> <b>track.</b> All of these products, and more, helped to popularize model railroading and {{assisted in the}} creation of a mass-market hobby. The growing company quickly outgrew the garage and basement of the family home. Realizing they could actually make a living selling track and related products, the first factory was built in nearby Hillside, New Jersey, at 413 Florence Avenue in 1947. On September 30, 1949, the Atlas Tool Company was incorporated.|$|E
50|$|In July 2011, Network Rail in its London & South East Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) {{recommended}} {{adding a}} fifth track to the four-track stretch of line between Clapham Junction and Surbiton. This {{was found to}} be feasible within the existing land (rail corridor), and was seen as the most practicable way of providing more capacity on the route. It would permit up to eight additional trains to run in the peak hour, for a maximum of 32 trains in this stretch. The scheme would also entail more <b>flexible</b> <b>track</b> use, modifying one Windsor Line track to permit use by mainline trains. Options rejected in the RUS as not viable included double-deck trains, building a flyover at Woking, and introducing 12- or 16-car trains.|$|E

5000|$|The Dynamic Ocean Track System Plus (DOTS+) {{automation}} system {{is located in}} each of the three Oceanic Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), (Anchorage, Oakland, and New York) and in the David J. Hurley Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. The DOTS generates <b>flexible</b> oceanic <b>tracks</b> that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. <b>Flexible</b> <b>tracks</b> are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switch Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information Network Server (WARP/WINS) system. The weather data is then distributed to the ARTCCs via commercially provided Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone lines. DOTS+ supports separation reduction initiatives as stipulated in RNP-10 (Required Navigation Performance) for decreasing lateral separation from 100 nmi km to 50 nmi km.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} tanks of this period, but in {{contrast}} to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, when the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite side were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a <b>flexible</b> <b>track</b> and Vickers developed one with rubber sealing washers between the moving parts. This could be a drawback, as wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy. Together with the great suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor could be prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.|$|E

30|$|Results of {{the contact}} forces under {{different}} structure flexibilities are presented for {{two kinds of}} rail corrugation: a randomly corrugated track and several single-harmonic corrugated tracks. For the random corrugation, the Timoshenko beam track model shows obvious difference compared with a rigid track model. Force peaks on the three directions {{could be found in}} the discrete support <b>flexible</b> <b>track</b> at each sleeper bay position. In the frequency range below 800  Hz, the <b>flexible</b> <b>track</b> model shows lower contact forces than the rigid model, while for frequency higher than 1000  Hz, the contact forces of the <b>flexible</b> <b>track</b> model are slightly higher than for the rigid track model. The rotating flexibility of the wheelset produces a higher longitudinal force when compared with a non-rotating flexible wheelset, while the vertical and lateral forces show little difference between the two wheelset models. For the single-harmonic corrugation case, the numerical results show that the wheel–rail contact force amplitude is generally increasing with growing velocities and shows a peak when the frequency of excitation meets the resonance frequencies of the flexible structure. However, it must be highlighted that the effect of velocity is more remarkable.|$|E
