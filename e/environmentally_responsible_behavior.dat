For this purpose, a total of 184 respondents made up of Sabahan (locals), other Malaysian (domestic),and non-Malaysian(international) visitors who were screened to ensure they had at least one previous visit to the marine park, participated in the survey. Notably, this study conceptualized both place attachment and site-specific <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> constructs into three sub-dimensions respectively (place dependence, place identity, place social bonding; and, sustainable behavior, pro-environmental behavior, and environmentally friendly behavior). Results showed that place dependence and place identity {{have a significant impact on}} sustainable behavior. On the other hand, place social bonding has a significant impact on pro-environmental behavior. Additionally, place identity and place social bonding have a significant impact on environmentally friendly behavior. This study examined whether visitors to TARP who have a level of place attachment will display increased site-specific <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> in the theoretical perspective. The research model for this study was novel as the measurement used for site-specific <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> in the current study is a new attempt to link the relationship of place attachment with site-specific <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior.</b> From the managerial perspective, this research is beneficial to natural resource management agencies which manage and operate marine parks for example, Sabah Parks to promote sustainability of the marine parks.

To meet the dual roles, it is important for destination marketers and resources managers to provide quality experiences for tourists and to induce tourists’ <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> in such destinations. This study documents the importance of perceptions toward climate change and tourist experiences in determining tourists’ <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> while enjoying holidays at nature-based tourism destinations in Jeju Island, South Korea. Two hundred and eleven Korean and 204 Chinese tourists marked dominant tourist arrivals to the island, and responded to the survey questionnaire.

In a nature-based tourism context under the pressure of climate change and adverse environmental effects as consequences of tourism activities, resources managers and destination marketers need to develop environmental campaigns or informative tourist programs to formulate <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> as well as to increase tourist quality experiences among domestic and international tourists...|$|E

This review paper describes the Technologies for Proenvironmental Action Model (TPAM), a conceptual framework that explicates how different functions of Web 2. 0 and social media (i. e., informational, relational, and experiential) can generate and/or facilitate personal, social, and contextual pathways to <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors.</b> As derived from the TPAM, the likelihood of achieving practical goals of increasing proenvironmental behaviors is enhanced when technological functions are matched to the different pathways to proenvironmental action. For example, the relational function of technologies, as exemplified by Social Networking Sites (SNSs), should be particularly effective in communicating social norms supportive of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The TPAM is intended as a guide to develop novel approaches, research questions, and methodologies in leveraging Web 2. 0 and social media technologies to promote proenvironmental action.

In both countries, the importance of intrinsic (versus extrinsic) life goals was associated cross-sectionally with <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior,</b> even after controlling for possible effects of environmental worldviews and environmental identification. In longitudinal analyses, life goals prospectively predicted <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> over a two-year period, whereas, rather unexpectedly, environmental worldviews and environmental identification did not.

This study concentrates on finding factors that encourage <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> in service sector companies. Research on this area has until now been lacking. The methodological choices are quantitative survey research and a qualitative case study. The survey examined the effect that employees' environmental knowledge, attitudes, social pressure, and the company's environmental management system have on <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior.</b> 756 office workers' in four different companies answered the survey. The case study investigated the efficiency of electricity saving measures in a service company. The research results consist of three main findings.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed some light on {{understanding}} why companies adopt <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> and what impact this adoption has on their performance. This is an empirical study that focuses on the United Nations (UN) Global Compact (GC) initiative as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mechanism. A survey was conducted among GC participants, of which 29 responded. The survey relies on the anticipated and actual benefits noted by the participants in the GC. The results, while not conclusive, indicate that companies have more than one reason for adopting <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> and that ethical and economic reasons co-exist. In terms of performance, the impact of participation in the GC seems to be particularly high in securing network opportunities and improved corporate image. The results indicate that companies that have participated many years in the GC, have submitted the most projects and have attended the most GC meetings also regard their CSR involvement as having had a strong, positive influence on their market performance. GC participation does not result in significant cost advantages, but this does not seem to have been regarded as a goal anyway.

40|$|This article {{constitutes}} {{a search for}} a people-oriented approach to encouraging <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior.</b> It attempts to provide a source of motiva-tions, reduce the corrosive sense of helplessness, and generate solutions to envi-ronmental problems that do not undermine {{the quality of life of}} the people who are affected. The altruism-centered approach currently popular in the academic liter-ature, by contrast, is seen as contributing to helplessness and focusing on sacrifice rather than quality-of-life-enhancing solutions. An alternative, the Reasonable Person Model, offers an evolutionary/cognitive/motivational approach to under-standing human nature. Facilitating the adoption of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behavior</b> (ERB) is a major challenge for the behavioral sciences. As with any problem, how one approaches it and whether or not it can be solved depend to a large degree on how the problem is conceptualized (Bardwell, 1989; Posner, 1973). In the research literature a prominent approach to this difficult issue has cast the problem as essen-tially motivational, focusing on altruism as a crucial motive to study (De Young, this issue). The altruism-centered approach is seen as having several inadvertent consequences, including contributing to helplessness and stressing sacrifice rather than quality-of-life-enhancing solutions. The purpose of this article is to propose an alternative approach that avoids some of the limitations inherent in the altruism-centered approach. This alternative approach has three goals: to provide a durable source of motivation, to reduce the corrosive sense of helplessness, and to generate innovative solutions that people do *Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Stephen Kaplan, Professor...|$|E
