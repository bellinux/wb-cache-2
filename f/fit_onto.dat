5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

The seating capacity offered by DSB across the Great Belt on an ordinary Wednesday has risen from 11,060 seats to 37,490 seats. On Fridays the seating capacity exceeds 40,000 seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} windlass is {{made from}} an iron rod of circular section, about half an inch in diameter and two feet long, bent to make an L-shape with legs of slightly different length.

25|$|The wugongchuan (蜈蚣船), or {{centipede}} ship, is a Chinese oared vessel of the 16th century {{inspired by}} the Portuguese galley. The defining characteristic of the wugongchuan is its numerous oars on its sides, evoking {{the image of a}} centipede, giving it its name. The wugongchuan was part of a series of Chinese experimentation with European ship designs of the period, as they attempted to <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> their ships the new breech-loading swivel guns, also brought by the Portuguese. Until this time, oars in such numbers were rarely used in large Chinese crafts.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} an egg-shaped primary lies {{apparently}} {{in the fact that}} a MIRV warhead is limited by the diameter of the primary—if an egg-shaped primary can be made to work properly, then the MIRV warhead can be made considerably smaller yet still deliver a high-yield explosion—a W88 warhead manages to yield up to 475 kt with a physics package 68.9 in (1.75 m) long, with a maximum diameter of 21.8 in (0.55 m), and weighing probably less than 800lb (360kg). The smaller warhead allows more of them to <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> a single missile and improves basic flight properties such as speed and range.|$|E
25|$|The G.II {{carried a}} crew of three and a {{defensive}} armament of two 7.92mm (.312in) machine guns. The forward section of the fuselage was skinned in plywood, with the remainder covered in fabric. The fuselage and two very large nacelles were mounted on the lower wing. Each nacelle contained fuel and oil tanks beneath each {{of a pair of}} geared-output 160KW (220hp) Mercedes D.IV straight-eight engines, one per nacelle, driving pusher propellers. The undercarriage was unusual, being quadricycle in arrangement with a pair of wheels mounted at the front and rear of each engine nacelle. This feature was intended to remove the possibility of a nose-over on landing. In fact, the nacelles and undercarriage constituted fully self-contained, wheeled units intended to facilitate construction and maintenance. The entire aircraft was intended to be easily dismantled so that fuselage, engines, and wings would easily <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> three railway flatcars.|$|E

500|$|Dylan mixed {{the album}} in Los Angeles in early April, before he {{departed}} on the Australian leg of his 1966 world tour. Wilentz writes {{that it was}} at this point it became [...] "obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> a single LP", and they had [...] "produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured double album, {{the first of its kind}} in contemporary popular music". According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan's LPs in mono as The Original Mono Recordings in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.|$|E
500|$|A soundtrack {{featuring}} the film's music {{was released by}} Columbia Records in 1979 together with the film debut, {{and was one of}} Goldsmith's best-selling scores. Sony's Legacy Recordings released an expanded two-disc edition of the soundtrack on November 10, 1998. The album added an additional 21 minutes of music to supplement the original track list, and was resequenced to reflect the story line of the film. The first disc features as much of the score as can <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> a 78-minute disc, while the second disc contains [...] "Inside Star Trek", a spoken word documentary from the 1970s. In 2012, the score was released yet again via La-La Land Records in association with Sony Music. [...] This 3-CD set contains the complete score for the first time, plus unreleased alternate and unused cues, in addition to the remastered original 1979 album.|$|E

500|$|When Studio Ghibli {{agreed to}} produce the {{animated}} sequences of Ni no Kuni, they contacted Joe Hisaishi {{to work on the}} game music. Hisaishi, who previously worked with Studio Ghibli on films such as Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001), met with Level-5 producer and writer Akihiro Hino. After witnessing Hino's passion for the project, Hisaishi agreed to work on the soundtrack. Rei Kondoh created {{the other half of the}} score, and all in-game music was performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] "Kokoro no Kakera", the games' theme song, was written by Hisaishi; his daughter Mai Fujisawa performed the song in Japanese, while chorister Archie Buchanan performed the English version. The team found great difficulty in selecting a performer for the English version, though ultimately settled upon Buchanan due to his ability to convey the [...] "vulnerability and innocence" [...] of the games characters in a [...] "moving and powerful performance". For the orchestral music to <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> the Nintendo DS at a high quality, Ni no Kuni: Dominion of the Dark Djinn was shipped on a 4-gigabit game card.|$|E
500|$|Concerning tracks {{related to}} {{times of day}} and {{elements}} such as battle themes, Shimomura allowed the flow of gameplay to dictate the flow of her music, which required putting {{in a number of}} natural transition points within pieces so the break would be smooth. To help with this, a special software tool called MAGI (Music API for Gaming Interaction) was developed to manage the tempo and create sync points that allowed the music's flow to be interactive while keeping its [...] "epic" [...] sound and scope. When the game began development as Versus XIII it used the same sound environment as Final Fantasy XIII, but with the move to new hardware the sound team needed to design a new sound environment. To develop the sound software, the team partnered with CRI Middleware to integrate the company's CRI ADX 2 middleware into the game's native sound environment. The amount of sound data, which also included 300 tracks of standalone music and 150 tracks of environmental music, required for the game was so large that there were fears it would not <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> the game disc alongside the rest of the game data.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Revo, {{the leader of}} Japanese musical group Sound Horizon. Asano contacted Revo concerning a collaboration as he had listened to his 2004 album Chronicle 2nd. During his work, Revo {{was able to see}} the game's ROM, then discuss the game's vision and development goals with Asano. While the initially-agreed track number was between 20 and 30, the number of tracks almost doubled during production as Revo saw situations that needed their own music. Revo aimed for a nostalgic musical style, referencing the music and atmosphere of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and the SaGa series. During recording, tracks were given descriptive working titles, such as [...] "Scene of Normal Battle" [...] or [...] "Song of Asterisk Holder Warfare". Multiple battle songs were created for the game, each having a faster tempo depending on the escalating battle situation. Revo's recording sessions were closely linked with the creation of the game's sound source, so the music would <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> the 3DS' limited storage space without losing too much of its quality. Once the music was recorded, a sound environment was created so that it could be heard clearly through the 3DS system's speakers. While there were concerns about the 3DS cartridge's storage space limitations, these ultimately proved to be minimal.|$|E

500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E

500|$|In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing [...] "Old Mystics" [...] for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and will just be a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not <b>fit</b> <b>onto</b> Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: [...] "it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left a little confused by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming." ...|$|E
