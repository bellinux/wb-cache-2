5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite <b>dextrorphan</b> increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan (the {{stereoisomer}} of levomethorphan, a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite <b>dextrorphan</b> have no {{opioid analgesic}} effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists {{and are used}} in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{acting as}} a direct NMDA {{receptor}} antagonist itself, dextromethorphan acts as a prodrug of its much more potent metabolite <b>dextrorphan,</b> {{and this is the}} actual mediator of its dissociative effects. What role, if any, (+)-3-methoxymorphinan, dextromethorphan's other major metabolite, plays in its effects is not entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|As NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, <b>dextrorphan</b> and dextromethorphan {{inhibit the}} excitatory amino acid and neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. This can effectively slow, or even shut down certain neural pathways, preventing {{areas of the}} brain from communicating with each other. This leaves the user feeling dissociated or disconnected, experienced as brain fog or derealization.|$|E
25|$|NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists {{induce a}} state called dissociative anesthesia, marked by catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia. Ketamine is a favored anesthetic for emergency patients with unknown medical history {{and in the}} treatment of burn victims because it depresses breathing and circulation less than other anesthetics. <b>Dextrorphan,</b> a metabolite of dextromethorphan (one of the most commonly used cough suppressants in the world), is known to be an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|DXM is {{also used}} recreationally. When {{exceeding}} approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative anesthetic. Its mechanism of action is via multiple effects, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. DXM and its major metabolite, <b>dextrorphan,</b> also act as an NMDA receptor antagonist at high doses, which produces effects similar to, yet distinct from, the dissociative states created by other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine and phencyclidine.|$|E
25|$|The {{first pass}} through the hepatic portal vein results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of dextromethorphan called <b>dextrorphan</b> (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan's {{euphoric effects}} have {{sometimes}} {{been attributed to}} an increase in dopamine levels, since such an increase generally correlates with pleasurable responses to drug, as is observed with some clinical antidepressants, as well as some recreational drugs. However, the effects of <b>dextrorphan</b> and dextromethorphan, and other NMDA receptor antagonists, on dopamine levels is a disputed subject. Studies show that the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and PCP do raise dopamine levels, although other studies show that another NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine has no effect on dopamine levels. Some findings even suggest that dextromethorphan can actually counter the dopamine-increasing effect caused by morphine. Due to these conflicting results, the actual effect of dextromethorphan on dopamine levels remains undetermined.|$|E
2500|$|Dextromethorphan's hallucinogenic and dissociative {{effects can}} be {{attributed}} largely to <b>dextrorphan</b> (DXO), a metabolite produced when dextromethorphan is metabolized by the body.

2500|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, dextromethorphan acts centrally (meaning that it acts on the brain) {{as opposed}} to locally (on the respiratory tract). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite <b>dextrorphan</b> in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. The average dose necessary for effective antitussive therapy is between 10 and 45mg, depending on the individual.

2500|$|Over-the-counter {{preparations}} containing dextromethorphan {{have been}} used in manners inconsistent with their labeling, often as a recreational drug. At doses much higher than medically recommended, DXM and its major metabolite, <b>dextrorphan,</b> acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which produces dissociative hallucinogenic states somewhat similar to ketamine and phencyclidine. Along with other drugs such as ketamine or phencyclidine, also known as PCP, there is a street name for dextromethorphan-infused substances which is also known as [...] "Angel." [...] It may produce distortions of the visual field – feelings of dissociation, distorted bodily perception, excitement, and a loss of sense of time. Some users report stimulant-like euphoria, particularly in response to music. Dextromethorphan usually provides its recreational effects in a non-linear fashion, so that they are experienced in significantly varied stages. These stages are commonly referred to as [...] "plateaus". Teens tend to have a higher likelihood to use dextromethorphan related drugs as it is easier to access, and an easier way to cope with psychiatric disorders.|$|E

50|$|Dextrallorphan (DXA) is an opioid {{derivative}} chemical of the morphinan {{class that}} is used in scientific research. It acts as a σ1 receptor agonist and NMDA receptor antagonist.

50|$|Intentionally {{consuming}} {{more than}} the recommended dosage of Delsym may result in euphoria, lack of coordination, hallucinations, apathy, feelings of dissociation, and disorientation.

50|$|Many of the {{alkaloids}} {{and other}} derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; {{the best example}} is the smooth-muscle relaxant papaverine.

50|$|Dimemorfan (INN) (or dimemorphan) (brand names Astomin, Dastosirr, Tusben), or {{dimemorfan}} phosphate (JAN), {{also known}} as 3,17-dimethylmorphinan, is an antitussive (cough suppressant) of the morphinan family that is widely used in Japan and is also marketed in Spain and Italy.

Dimemorfan is an analogue of dextromethorphan (DXM) and its active metabolite <b>dextrorphan</b> (DXO), and similarly to them, acts as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 151 nM). However, unlike DXM and DXO, it does not act significantly as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and for this reason, lacks dissociative effects, thereby having reduced side effects and abuse potential in comparison. Similarly to DXM and DXO, dimemorfan has only relatively low affinity for the σ2 receptor (Ki = 4421 nM).|$|E
