5|$|Free-flights of Progress {{spacecraft}} typically lasted {{two days}} from launch to docking with Mir, however Progress M1-5 took {{three days to}} reach Mir in order to conserve fuel for the deorbit burn. If it had launched on 18 January it would have spent four days in <b>free</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|<b>Free</b> <b>flight</b> {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992 and 1993, The Hoover Company {{introduced}} a [...] "free flights" [...] offer whereby any customer spending over £100 would receive two <b>free</b> <b>flights</b> to New York City. Due to an overwhelming response, {{many people did}} not receive their tickets and were denied {{the opportunity to take}} their <b>free</b> <b>flights.</b> After hundreds of complaints to Watchdog, an investigation by reporter Simon Walton revealed that the company in charge of processing applications was trying to deny customers their <b>free</b> <b>flights</b> in an effort to stem the rising costs. This quickly became headline news and Hoover were forced to give all customers the flights, costing them an estimated £40 million and the jobs of all the board members.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, Hill was {{interview}}ed by Ultrasport. They offered her a <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> to New York for the interview {{and as part of}} the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a degree in biology in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the launch}} resumed on 22 January, and the launch {{occurred}} successfully at 04:28:42 GMT on 24 January. Following the launch, Progress M1-5 {{spent three days}} in <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> before docking with the rear port of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port had previously been occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mirs orbit, in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, burning up during re-entry at 02:58.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2001, the Sumos of VMGR-152 {{exceeded}} 230,000 mishap <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> hours. In July 2005, the Sumos exceeded 250,000 mishap-free flight hours.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} methods of {{piloting}} balloons: <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> or captive. <b>Free</b> <b>flight</b> {{meant that the}} balloon was able to travel in any direction or distance for as long or {{as far as the}} pilot was able to fly it. Captive flight meant that the balloon was retained by a tether or series of tethers manned by ground crews. <b>Free</b> <b>flight</b> required that the pilot ascend and return by his own control. Captive flight used ground crews to assist in altitude control and speedy return to the exact starting point. Tethers also allowed for the stringing of telegraph wires back to the ground. Information gathered from balloon observation was relayed to the ground by various means of signaling. From high altitudes the telegraph was almost always necessary. At closer altitudes a series of prepared flag signals, hand signals, or even a megaphone could be used to communicate with the ground. At night either the telegraph or lamps could be used. In the later battles of Lowe's tenure, all reports and communications were ordered to be made orally by ascending and descending with the balloon. This is notable in Lowe's Official Report II to the Secretary where his usual transcriptions of messages were lacking. <b>Free</b> <b>flight</b> would almost always require the aeronaut to return and make a report. This would be an obvious detriment to timely reporting.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the British {{division}} of Hoover announced the Hoover <b>free</b> <b>flights</b> promotion, {{the demand for}} which rose far beyond the company's expectations, resulting in major costs and public relations problems for the British division and Maytag, which eventually led to its sale to the Italian manufacturer Candy. In 1993, Sandy Jack became {{the first person in}} the United Kingdom to take Hoover to court over the Hoover <b>free</b> <b>flights</b> promotion. Upon the decision in Hoover v. Sandy Jack at Sheriff Court in Kirkcaldy, Fife, a precedent was set. Hoover Holiday Pressure Group furthered court action against Hoover at St. Helens in Merseyside.|$|R

25|$|Lowe {{considered}} the incident an argument against <b>free</b> <b>flight.</b> LaMountain {{insisted that the}} flight was highly successful despite the unfortunate incident. The showdown did nothing to settle the argument, but Lowe's position as Chief Aeronaut allowed him to prevail.|$|E
25|$|LaMountain and Lowe {{had long}} argued over <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> and captive flight. In Lowe's first {{instance}} of demonstration at Bull Run, {{he made a}} <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> which caught him hovering over Union encampments who could not properly identify him. As a civilian he wore no uniform nor insignias. With each descent came the threat of being fired on, and to make each descent Lowe needed to release gas. In one instance Lowe was forced to land behind enemy lines and await being rescued overnight. After this incident he remained tethered to the ground by which he could be reeled in at a moment's notice. Besides, {{his use of the}} telegraph from the balloon car required a wire be run along the tether.|$|E

25|$|A glider is a heavier-than-air {{aircraft}} that is supported in flight by the dynamic {{reaction of the}} air against its lifting surfaces, and whose <b>free</b> <b>flight</b> {{does not depend on}} an engine.

25|$|John Wise was {{an early}} pioneer of American {{ballooning}} born in 1808. Although he made great contributions to the then newborn science of aeronautics, he was more a showman than a scientist.
