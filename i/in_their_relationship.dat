5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader {{able to handle}} the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to give an insight of the {{construction}} of girls <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers in the Swedish magazine Julia. The magazine turns to girls of age nine to fourteen. The research questions were 1) What is the construction of the girls <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers about in Julia? 2) How are girls constructed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers? Three issues of the magazine from the winter of 2014 were selected as material for the study. Critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992, 2010) was the point of departure in the analysis. The main findings of the study were that the magazine focused on that girls should have a love relation that is heterosexual monogamous and that the magazine encourages the girls to make friends. The magazine also described how girls should be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers and what activities they could practise with their friends and lovers. The magazine’s construction of how girls should be could be discussed as if that leaves the readers, i. e. mainly girls, with a feeling that they do not have the opportunity to make several choices about <b>their</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
40|$|Examines how GP 2 ̆ 7 s {{can respond}} to men who use {{violence}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships,</b> and takes into account that male perpetrators are not a homogenous group, coming from all socioeconomic and cultural groups. Background Perpetrators of domestic violence are predominantly men, and victims/survivors are usually women and children. Men who use violence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> may present to general practice with relationship problems, mental health issues or substance abuse. Domestic violence has a significant {{negative impact on the}} health and wellbeing of the whole family. General practitioners (GPs) potentially play a pivotal role in identification, response and referral to men’s behavioural change services. Objective This article aims to describe how GPs can identify and respond to men who use violence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships.</b> It takes into account that male perpetrators are not a homogenous group, coming from all socioeconomic and cultural groups. Discussion GPs have a role in the identification, management and referral of men who use violence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships.</b> Great care needs to be taken when GPs are seeing the whole family, {{to ensure the safety of}} women and children...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{his first}} {{marriage}} he {{had a number of}} affairs with other women. He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b> Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children. Hergé was raised as a Catholic although was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the Tao Te Ching and Arnaud Desjardins' The Path to Wisdom, as well as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics and the work of Jean-Émile Charon.|$|E

5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing}} that she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit {{in the head with a}} glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E

40|$|Appealing to the Heart of a Social-Relationship: Relational {{models and}} persuasion 2 The Role of Relational Models in Pro-Social Message Processing and Persuasion Relational Model Theory (Fiske, 1991, 1992) proposes that {{interpersonal}} relationships {{are based on}} only four fundamental relational models that reside in human cognition: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing. The type of relational model persons use <b>in</b> <b>their</b> interpersonal <b>relationships</b> determine what type of behaviors persons enact <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships,</b> and how they interpret the behaviors of their partners.
