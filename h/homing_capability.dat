50|$|The Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedo, a.k.a. ASTOR, was a submarine-launched wire-guided nuclear torpedo {{designed}} by the United States Navy for use against high-speed, deep-diving, enemy submarines. The 19 in-diameter torpedo was fitted with a W34 nuclear warhead. The need to maintain direct control over the warhead meant that a wire connection had to be maintained between the torpedo and submarine until detonation. Wire guidance systems were piggybacked onto this cable, and the torpedo had no <b>homing</b> <b>capability.</b> The design was completed in 1960, and 600 torpedoes were built between 1963 and 1976, when ASTOR {{was replaced by the}} Mark 48 torpedo.|$|E
50|$|This {{electrically}} propelled, 19 in-diameter torpedo was 227 in {{long and}} weighed 2400 lb. The W34 nuclear warhead used in ASTOR had an explosive yield of 11 kilotons. The requirement for positive control of nuclear warheads meant that ASTOR {{could only be}} detonated by a deliberate signal from the firing submarine, which necessitated a wire link. Because of this, the torpedo was only fitted with wire guidance systems (transmitted over the same link), and had no <b>homing</b> <b>capability.</b> The torpedo had a range of 5 to 8 mi. By replacing the nuclear warhead and removing the wire guidance systems, the torpedo could be reconfigured for unguided launch against surface targets.|$|E

The level of cell kill produced by 111 In-DTPA-F 3 was highly variable (19 fold range in surviving fraction) depending on the malignant cell line, and was correlated with the localisation of cell-bound 111 In-DTPA-F 3 in the nucleus. The induction of Î³H 2 AX foci by 111 In-DTPA-F 3 was found to be determined by the volume of the nucleolus.

40|$|Donor-specific HLA {{antibody}} (DSA) -mediated graft {{injury is}} the major cause of kidney loss. Among DSA characteristics, graft homing has been suggested {{as an indicator of}} severe tissue damage. We analyzed the role of de novo DSA (dnDSA) graft homing on kidney transplantation outcome. Graft biopsy specimens and parallel sera from 48 nonsensitized pediatric kidney recipients were analyzed. Serum samples and eluates from graft biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of dnDSAs with flow bead technology. Intragraft dnDSAs (gDSAs) were never detected in the absence of serum dnDSAs (sDSAs), whereas in the presence of sDSAs, gDSAs were demonstrated in 72 % of biopsy specimens. A significantly higher <b>homing</b> <b>capability</b> was expressed by class II sDSAs endowed with high mean fluorescence intensity and C 3 d- and/or C 1 q-fixing properties. In patients with available sequential biopsy specimens, we detected gDSAs before the appearance of antibody-mediated rejection. In sDSA-positive patients, gDSA positivity did not allow stratification for antibody-mediated graft lesions and graft loss. However, a consistent detection of skewed unique DSA specificities was observed over time within the graft, likely responsible for the damage. Our results indicate that gDSAs could represent an instrumental tool to identify, among sDSAs, clinically relevant antibody specificities requiring monitoring and possibly guiding patient management...|$|E

Though B. me. I 1 does not intervene in any recognizable exon gene, the splicing ability of B. me. I 1 in Escherichia coli was confirmed by applying RT-PCR with RNA template transcribed by using a T 7 RNA polymerase-promoter expression system. The homing activity of B. me. I 1 was confirmed by using an intron-less allele fragment as a specific integration site which was cloned from Tn 5084, a TnMERI 1 -family mercury resistance transposon. The transcription and splicing of B. me. I 1 in the original host, the strain MBI, were also observed as its natural property. Primer-walking and 5 ' RACE analyses showed that the transcription start site and the putative promoter region of B. me. I 1 were located on the antisense strand of tnpR gene of TnMERI 1. Therefore, it is cleared that TnMERI 1 provides a specific integration site and facilities for transcription of B. me. I 1. From these results, it is considered that these genetic facilities given by the transposon TnMERI 1 confer splicing and <b>homing</b> <b>capability</b> on B. me.

40|$|Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a {{cancerous}} {{disease that}} {{is defined by}} the inability to produce functional and mature blood cells, as well as the uncontrolled proliferation due to failure to undergo apoptosis of abnormal cells. The most common therapy for Leukemia, chemotherapy, has proven only to be partially efficient since it does not target the leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that have a high self-renewal and repopulation capacity and result in remission of the disease. Therefore targeting LSCs will provide more efficient therapy. One way to achieve this would be to inhibit their <b>homing</b> <b>capability</b> to the bone marrow. It has recently been shown that CD 44, an adhesive molecule, plays a crucial role in cell trafficking and lodgement of both normal and leukemic stem cells. More importantly anti-CD 44 monoclonal antibodies, along with its ability to induce differentiation of leukemic blasts, it inhibits specifically the homing capacity of LSCs to their micro-environmental niches. However, these molecular mechanisms that underlie the inhibition of homing have yet to be determined. To address these questions we conducted in vitro adhesion and blot-rolling assays to analyze the adherence and rolling capacity of these LSCs before and after treatment with anti-CD 44 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Since glycosyltransferases {{play a crucial role in}} post translational carbohydrate decoration on adhesion molecules, we analyzed the expression (using quantitative PCR) of the different glycosyltransferases expressed in LSC's before and after CD 44 ligation (mAb treatment).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{have been studied}} for damaged liver repair; however, the {{conclusions}} drawn regarding their homing capacity to the injured liver are conflicting. Besides, the relative utility and synergistic effects of these two cell types on the injured liver remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MSCs, HSCs and the combination of both cells {{were obtained from the}} bone marrow of male mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein(EGFP) and injected into the female mice with or without liver fibrosis. The distribution of the stem cells, survival rates, liver function, hepatocyte regeneration, growth factors and cytokines of the recipient mice were analyzed. We found that the liver content of the EGFP-donor cells was significantly higher in the MSCs group than in the HSCs or MSCs+HSCs group. The survival rate for the MSCs group was significantly higher than that of the HSCs or MSCs+HSCs group; all surpassed the control group. After MSC-transplantation, the injured livers were maximally restored, with less collagen than the controls. The fibrotic areas had decreased to a lesser extent in the mice transplanted with HSCs or MSCs+HSCs. Compared with mice in the HSCs group, the mice that received MSCs had better improved liver function. MSCs exhibited more remarkable paracrine effects and immunomodulatory properties on hepatic stellate cells and native hepatocytes in the treatment of the liver pathology. Synergistic actions of MSCs and HSCs were most likely not observed because the stem cells in liver were detected mostly as single cells, and single MSCs are insufficient to provide a beneficial niche for HSCs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MSCs exhibited a greater <b>homing</b> <b>capability</b> for the injured liver and modulated fibrosis and inflammation more effectively than did HSCs.

40|$|Freshly {{isolated}} human hematopoietic {{stem and}} progenitor cells (HSPCs) {{are small and}} round cells which upon cultivation adopt a polarized morphology and redistribute certain cell surface antigens. To functionally dissect this polarization process, we addressed impacts of protein synthesis, HSPC trafficking, cytoskeleton organization or lipid raft integrity on the establishment and maintenance of the cell polarity of human HSPCs. Effects on the morphology, sub-cellular distribution of lipid raft-associated molecular polarization markers (Flotillin- 1, Flotillin- 2, ICAM- 3) and in vitro migration capabilities of treated cells were studied. We could distinguish two levels of cellular polarization, a molecular and a morphological level. Our data suggest that protein synthesis, lipid raft integrity and enzymatic activities of PI 3 K and aPKC are required to organize the molecular cell polarity. The morphological cell polarization process, however, also depends on actin polymerization and rho-GTPase activities.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} (HSC) self-renewal, {{proliferation}} and differentiation are regulated by signaling through protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) such as c-kit, Flt- 3 and Tie 2. PTKs work {{in concert with}} receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) to maintain cellular equilibrium. The functions of PTPs in counterbalancing PTK signaling in HSCs however remain incompletely understood. Our laboratory has demonstrated that a heparin binding growth factor, Pleiotrophin (PTN), promotes the expansion of murine long-term (LT) -HSCs via binding to a PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ). The addition of PTN to murine PTPRZ-/- c-Kit+Sca- 1 +Lineage- (KSL) cells caused no expansion of HSCs in culture, suggesting that PTPRZ mediates PTN effects on HSC growth. We subsequently screened {{for the expression of}} other receptor PTPs in murine HSCs. Among 21 different receptor PTPs, we found that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type S (PTPRS) was significantly overexpressed in mouse and human HSCs compared to more mature hematopoietic cells. Ptprs-/- mice displayed no difference in mature blood counts or phenotypic HSC frequency compared to Ptprs+/+ mice. However, competitive transplantation of bone marrow (BM) cells from Ptprs-/- mice resulted in more than 8 -fold increased multilineage hematopoietic repopulation in primary and secondary recipient mice compared to mice transplanted with BM cells from Ptprs+/+ mice. While Ptprs-/- mice displayed no differences in cell cycle status, HSC survival or <b>homing</b> <b>capability</b> compared to Ptprs+/+ mice, PTPRS-/- BM cells expressed significantly increased levels of activated Rac 1, a RhoGTPase which regulates HSC engraftment capacity, compared to PTPRS+/+ BM cells. PTPRS-/- BM cells displayed significantly increased transendothelial migration capacity and cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC), consistent with increased Rac 1 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of Rac 1 abrogated the increased transendothelial migration capacity of PTPRS-/- BM cells, suggesting that the augmented engraftment capacity of PTPRS-/- BM cells was mediated via Rac 1. Translationally, we demonstrated that negative selection of human cord blood Lin-CD 34 +CD 38 -CD 45 RA- cells for PTPRS expression yielded a 15 -fold enrichment for human long term HSCs compared to Lin-CD 34 +CD 38 -CD 45 RA- cells or Lin-CD 34 +CD 38 -CD 45 RA- PTPRS+ cells. These data suggest that PTPRS regulates HSC repopulating capacity via inhibition of Rac 1 and selection of human PTPRS - negative HSCs is a translatable strategy to significantly enrich human cord blood HSCs for transplantation.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a novel concept has emerged {{indicating}} that the actual role of natural killer (NK) cells {{is not confined to}} the destruction of virus-infected cells or tumors. Indeed, different NK subsets exist that display major functional differences in their cytolytic activity, cytokine production and <b>homing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In particular, CD 56 high CD 16 - NK cells that largely predominate in lymph nodes, have little cytolytic activity but release high levels of cytokines whereas CD 56 low CD 16 + NK cells that predominate in peripheral blood and inflamed tissues, display lower cytokine production, but potent cytotoxicity. The latter is characterized by granule polarization and exocytosis of various proteins including perforin and granzymes that mediate target cell killing. The recruitment of CD 56 low CD 16 + NK cells into inflamed peripheral tissues is orchestrated by various chemochines including the newly identified Chemerin. At these sites, NK cells, upon engagement of different triggering receptors become activated and upregulate their cytokine production and cytotoxicity after interaction with myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, during this interaction NK cells also mediate the ‘editing’ of DCs undergoing maturation.

Data {{revealed that the}} route of prime or the booster immunization differentially influenced the integrin expression profile on gut KdGag 197 - 205 -specific CD 8 + T cells. Specifically, elevated numbers of integrin αE and αD expressing gut KdGag 197 - 205 -specific CD 8 + T cells were detected following mucosal but not systemic priming. Also, αE/β 7 and αD/β 2 heterodimerization were more noticeable in an intranasal (i. n.) /i. n. vaccination setting compared to i. n. /intramuscular (i. m) or i. m. /i. m. vaccinations. Moreover, in all vaccine groups tested α 4 appeared to heterodimerize more closely with β 7 then β 1. Also MIP- 1 β, RANTES, CCR 5, perforin and integrin α 4 bio-markers were significantly elevated in i. n. /i. m. and i. m. /i. m. immunization groups compared to purely mucosal i. n. /i. n. delivery. Furthermore, when wild type (WT) BALB/c and IL- 13 knockout (KO) mice were immunized using i. n. /i. m. strategy, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β, RANTES, integrins α 4, β 1 and β 7 mRNA expression levels {{were found to be}} significantly different, in mucosal verses systemic KdGag 197 - 205 -specific CD 8 + T cells.

40|$|Coordinated {{lymphocyte}} adhesion {{and migration}} is {{a hallmark of}} the adaptive immune response in both physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying lymphocyte trafficking at the molecular level may provide novel targets for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. The controlled migratory pattern of lymphocytes, commonly referred to as homing, is critically dependent on specialized microvasculature and is facilitated by the expression of adhesion molecules and signaling chemokines. During steady state conditions, homing of immune cells occurs continuously in the lymph nodes due to the constitutive expression of homing molecules, whereas during an inflammatory condition, a reactive up regulation of these adhesion molecules is necessary for immune cell trafficking to take place. The dynamics of immune cell recruitment, demonstrated by intravital microscopy, showed that lymphocyte adhesion in the target tissue's microvascular bed is mostly restricted to the post-capillary and collecting venules, whereas arterioles and capillaries can not support this interaction. High shear stress exerted by fluid dynamics in the lumen of venules requires intravascular lymphocytes to anchor using receptor molecules that form mechanically stable bonds with counter receptors in the vascular wall (von Andrian & Mackay, 2000). These molecules {{play a key role in}} lymphocyte binding and facilitate the directed migration of lymphocytes by functioning as a tissue specific recognition molecule differentially expressed on the surface of lymph node ECs (von Andrian & Mackay, 2000). Specialized venular ECs found in lymph nodes and Peyer's Patches (PPs) called high endothelial venules (HEVs) constitutively express on their surface a specialized type of this homing molecule called addressins, allowing for the continuous recruitment of lymphocytes during steady state conditions. Elsewhere in the body, ECs must be activated by exposure to inflammatory mediators in order to allow transendothelial migration to the inflamed tissue. There is strong evidence to show the homing signature of a lymphocyte is dependent on the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors on the cell surface as well as their ligands expressed by the venular endothelium. Here, we hypothesize that the cytokine signaling receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp 130) is a functional requirement for eliciting an effective recruitment of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs during steady states. Glycoprotein 130 is a signaling subunit involved with the interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) family of cytokines. Previous studies done in the lab have shown that this glycoprotein is over expressed in the venular versus non-venular endothelial cells, indicating a potential role of gp 130 in lymphocyte homing during steady state conditions. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing short term homing assays using donor β-actin-GFP splenocytes, with recipient litter-mate controls and recipient conditional or inducible conditional knockout mouse models that lack gp 130 expression on ECs. By comparing the homing abilities of GFP+ splenocytes to various secondary lymphoid organs in wild type versus knockout mouse models, we were able to determine that gp 130 expression on the endothelial cell compartment does have a role in lymphocyte homing, demonstrated by impaired <b>homing</b> <b>capabilities</b> evident in only the knockout mice. Identifying the function of gp 130 expressed by venular ECs and its role in lymphocyte recruitment during steady state conditions may lead to a better understanding of the immune system and it's complexity during the dynamic maintenance of homeostatic health...|$|R

MSCs can differentiate into osteoblastic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages, although recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} MSCs are also able to differentiate into other lineages, including neuronal and cardiomyogenic lineages. Since their original isolation from the bone marrow, MSCs have been successfully harvested from many other tissues. Their ease of isolation and ex vivo expansion combined with their immunoprivileged nature has made these cells popular candidates for stem cell therapies. These cells have the potential to alter disease pathophysiology through many modalities including cytokine secretion, capacity to differentiate along various lineages, immune modulation and direct cell-cell interaction with diseased tissue. Here we first review basic features of MSC biology including MSC characteristics in culture, <b>homing</b> mechanisms, differentiation <b>capabilities</b> and immune modulation. We then highlight some in vivo and clinical evidence supporting the therapeutic roles of MSCs and their uses in orthopedic, autoimmune, and ischemic disorders...|$|R
