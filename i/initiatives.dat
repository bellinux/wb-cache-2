40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis discusses {{the evolution of}} individual <b>initiative</b> in fighter tactics of the Soviet Air Force. World War II forced pilots to break from restrictive tactics and to develop and use <b>initiative</b> in combat. By war's end, Soviet fighters' <b>initiative</b> greatly resembled western fighters'. However, since WWII technology and doctrine led {{to an increase in}} control measures and a decline in <b>initiative.</b> Despite this, veterans of combat have consistently spoken out for realistic training and the freedom for fighter <b>initiative.</b> As a result, emphasis on <b>initiative</b> rose in the late 1970 's. But current Soviet pilots do not come close to having the <b>initiative</b> of WWII fighters and the recent emphasis on <b>initiative</b> may be short-lived. Current techÂ­nology gives the Soviet Air Force the choice of developing or extinguishing <b>initiative</b> among their fighters. History suggests that without a threat to their survival the choice against <b>initiative</b> will be made. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a local {{government}} may refuse {{to place a}} local Proposition 218 <b>initiative</b> on the ballot even though the required number of signatures has been obtained and certified. Once a local <b>initiative</b> measure has qualified for the ballot, the responsible local entity or official generally has a mandatory duty to place the <b>initiative</b> on the ballot. [...] If the responsible local entity or official refuses to place the <b>initiative</b> on the ballot, this can force the <b>initiative</b> proponents to file a lawsuit to legally require the {{local government}} to place the <b>initiative</b> on the ballot. Even if such a lawsuit by the <b>initiative</b> proponents is successful, it often results in a delay in when the <b>initiative</b> measure eventually appears on the ballot which is often part of the strategy of a hostile local government. <b>Initiative</b> proponents generally need to incorporate this potential scenario in their timetable for pursuing a local <b>initiative</b> under Proposition 218.|$|R

50|$|A tie-in <b>initiative</b> {{associated}} with local government bad conduct events {{can also be}} incorporated into a Proposition 218 compensatory <b>initiative</b> (a compensatory tie-in hybrid <b>initiative).</b> As an example, suppose a local <b>initiative</b> under Proposition 218 is pursued to reduce or repeal a local government utility fee and the local government subsequently sues the <b>initiative</b> proponents to prevent the ballot <b>initiative</b> from proceeding or seeks to invalidate the <b>initiative.</b> As a potential legislative remedy, the <b>initiative</b> proponents could file a compensatory <b>initiative</b> providing for the reduction or repeal of a utility users tax imposed by the local government with a tie-in to local bad conduct events {{associated with}} the utility fee reduction or repeal <b>initiative</b> that was previously filed. The practical effect {{of this approach is}} that the local government could be facing a substantial loss of utility user tax revenues if it continues with its bad conduct in connection with the utility fee reduction or repeal <b>initiative.</b> If the local government were to subsequently act more responsibly in connection with the utility fee reduction or repeal <b>initiative</b> (such as dropping a lawsuit and allowing the measure to proceed to the ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained), the loss of utility user tax revenues would be minimal.|$|R
