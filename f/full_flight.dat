5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil {{airliner}} to include a full digital fly-by-wire flight control system.

5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> status on May 7, 1969.|$|E

5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Flower and the Rose is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Frank Wilson, {{the son of an}} inventor who has constructed a new airplane model. After failing to secure financing, his father suggests that he marry Rose, the daughter of his wealthy employer, to get the money they need. Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman, but he soon learns she does not love him. He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful. He returns to the aviation field and meets Rose again, after a successful flight she confesses to loving him. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park. One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in <b>full</b> <b>flight.</b> The film was released on November 25, 1910, but is now presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|This new sail {{was much}} larger than the others sighted earlier in the day, and the {{detached}} squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival, Hercule. By 17:45, L'Héritier was in <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> with the British force strung out behind him, the rest of Bridport's fleet far to the west. Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind, although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back. Hood, an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood, pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule. L'Héritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed, and sought instead to escape through the narrow and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein, a rocky passage between the Île de Sein and the Pointe du Raz: during the Expédition d'Irlande the French ship of the line Séduisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives.|$|E
50|$|Another {{organization}} actively exploring reusable crewed suborbital spaceplanes is XCOR Aerospace. XCOR's Lynx suborbital vehicle {{would take}} off {{under its own}} power horizontally from a runway. Upon takeoff, it would pitch up and climb to over 100 km. With the engines shut down, it would then glide back and land on the runway. The Lynx will be capable of flying four <b>full</b> <b>flights</b> per day.|$|R

5|$|When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD {{seats were}} filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 {{remained}} {{by the end}} of the session. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office. In any case, the VNQDD never had any power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met only once a year. In any case, the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into <b>full</b> <b>flight.</b> A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.|$|E
5|$|With the French in <b>full</b> <b>flight,</b> Bulteel {{determined}} {{to continue the}} ruse that his convoy consisted of warships. While he and Belliqueux pursued Concorde, he signalled for his largest East Indiamen to follow the other French ships {{to ensure that they}} did not return and counterattack the convoy while Belliqueux was engaged. Exeter, under Captain Henry Meriton, and Bombay Castle, under Captain John Hamilton, were to follow Médée while Coutts, under Captain Robert Torin, and Neptune, under Captain Nathaniel Spens, were to follow Franchise. All four vessels were over 1200 tons (bm) and carried 30cannon each, but none had more than 130crew aboard and could not compete in accuracy or rate of fire with the 315men aboard each of the French ships. Throughout the afternoon the chase continued, with Belliqueux steadily gaining on the French flagship while Franchise, accompanied by the American schooner, gained on her pursuers. At 17:20, Bulteel was within long range of Landolphe's ship, which returned fire when possible. During the exchange of gunfire neither side suffered damage or casualties, but the ship of the line was clearly gaining on the frigate and within ten minutes Landolphe surrendered rather than see his ship destroyed and his men killed in an unequal combat.|$|E
