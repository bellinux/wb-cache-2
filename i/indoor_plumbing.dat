5|$|By {{the time}} World War II was over, the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into disrepair. They had been {{neglected}} throughout the Great Depression and wartime. In 1959, the City of Minneapolis presented {{a plan for}} the Seward neighborhood, which listed the houses on Milwaukee Avenue in 'deteriorated' condition, meaning they had no <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> or were severely battered.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
50|$|The Community Centre Hall {{was built}} over the period of 1883-1889. Gas lights were {{installed}} in 1923 and were replaced in 1931 when the hall was wired for electricity {{at a cost of}} $137.50. The wall behind the stage was painted by local artist Garnet Hazard in 1948 and has become an iconic fixture of the hall. It took almost 15 years for the residents of Walters Falls to convince the hall board that <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbed</b> washrooms were necessary so they finally succumbed and had them constructed in 1975.|$|R
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by <b>plumbed</b> <b>indoor</b> toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|R
5000|$|Beijing's {{inner city}} wall was built during the Ming Dynasty in 1419. The Ming city walls stood for nearly 550 years {{until the early}} 1960s {{when most of the}} gates and walls were torn down to build the Beijing Subway, which runs {{underneath}} where the walls stood. The subway's inner loop line turned into the Inner City at Chongwenmen to stop at the Beijing Railway Station, and did not need to run beneath a section of the wall at the southeast corner of the Inner City. Of the 40 km of the original wall, only this 1.5 km section was spared. Inside this section of the wall (north of the wall) are railway yards of Beijing Station. Outside the wall (south of the wall) stood residential homes and small businesses. In the late 1990s, the city government decided convert the remnants of the wall into a park and relocate the small businesses and homes between the foot of the southern city wall and Chongwenmen East Avenue. The relocated businesses and residents received compensation and tax exemptions. [...] Construction began in November 2001. The homes, which lacked <b>indoor</b> heating, <b>plumbing</b> and running water, were razed but large trees that stood in the courtyards were preserved. To preserve the historical integrity of the fortifications, the authorities solicited donations of Ming era bricks from city residents to use in the restoration. [...] About of one-fifth of 2,000,000 bricks used in the restoration are from the Ming-era.|$|R
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> so they relied on a fireplace for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E
5|$|Day {{was born}} to glass factory worker Ellis Day and his wife Hattie Leet in Alexandria, Virginia, a city seven miles from Washington, D.C, on October 30, 1916. His family, which {{included}} five other siblings, moved the following year to Mount Winans, a predominantly black community in a poor area of Southwest Baltimore, in a residence situated on Pierpont Street that lacked electricity and <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing.</b> At a young age, Day became enamored with baseball, often playing local sandlot games or taking the long walk from his neighborhood to Maryland Ball Park where he watched the Baltimore Black Sox.|$|E
2500|$|The company built {{a company}} town, Pullman, Illinois on , [...] south of Chicago in 1880. Pullman {{contracted}} Solon Spenser Beman and Nathan F. Barrett {{to design and}} landscape the entire company town respectively. Both Beman and Barrett were experts in their respective fields. Beman interned under the famous architect Richard Upjohn and Barrett landscaped areas in Staten Island and Tuxedo, New York, as well as Long Branch, New Jersey. The community was designed by Solon Spencer Beman and landscaped by Nathan Barrett. According to George Pullman's governing conception, it was not within the city limits of Chicago but in the adjoining town of Hyde Park. On April 24, 1880, groundwork began on the company town. Throughout {{the construction of the}} company town Pullman strove to minimize costs and maximize construction efficiency. Whenever and wherever possible Pullman adopted techniques of mass production. The first departments and shops constructed were ones such as painting, iron, and woodworking, which could be used in the continuing construction of the company town. By January 1, 1881, the company town was ready for its first resident to move in. A foreman from the Pullman Companyâ€™s Detroit shop, Lee Benson, moved his wife, child, and sister into the company town. On the exterior, the buildings of the company town were made of red brick with limestone trim. On the interior, the buildings had high ceilings and large windows. The walls of the interior of the buildings were also purposefully painted in light colors to provide the semblance of a cheerful environment. By the time construction was finished on the company town it was composed of a library, theater, hotel, church, market, sewage farm, park, and residential buildings. The bar in the Florence Hotel was the only place where alcohol could be served and consumed in the company town. In the residential section of the town, there was 150 acres dedicated to tenements, flats and single-family homes that rented from $0.50 to $0.75 a month. The residences featured modern conveniences such as gas, water, <b>indoor</b> sewage <b>plumbing</b> and regular garbage removal. By 1884, the town included more than 1,400 tenements and flats, and by July of the following year, its population was over 8,600.|$|R
40|$|Do-it-yourself (DIY) is the {{practice}} of household members undertaking home improvement or maintenance on their own, instead of hiring professional help. While DIY is a substantial and steadily growing cultural and economic phenomenon in several developed countries, in India, it is still in a stage of infancy. The objective {{of this research is}} to understand whether DIY can be introduced and developed in India as a significant consumer activity based on an understanding of the DIY markets in developed countries (like USA, UK & France) and the business models in place to service them. The concept of DIY started sometime in middle of the 20 th century in the USA and it eventually spread to UK and rest of Europe in the later part of the century. Currently, in most developed countries DIY constitutes {{a significant portion of the}} Home Improvement and repair Market and there are specialized organized retail chains to cater to the DIY demand. In India and most developing countries, DIY is not an established practice and does not contribute at all to the Home Improvement and repair Market. Organized retail in most developing countries is very small and most of the Home Improvement Market is serviced through local decorative and hardware distribution outlets. Brazil is an exceptional case due to its large organized retail structure for servicing the home improvement market. Organized retail to service the Home Improvement and repair Market in China has started in a big way and is witnessing exponential growth year on year. Similar phenomenon has started in India as well. However, both in China and India, there is no specific demand for DIY products and the same clearly needs to be created. Existing research literature on DIY, focuses mainly, on the determination of variables that influence the decision to take up a DIY or a home improvement project. Apart from this, a large number of business reports and studies profiling specific DIY markets are available over the internet. Work has also been done to trace and record the history of DIY and its impact on culture and society. While there has been some research work carried out that deals with the development of strategy for DIY markets in developed countries, no such work has been done in the context of developing countries. The purpose of this research is to do just that but the scope is limited to household painting and carpentry. The pilot study (focussed group discussions) and the questionnaire survey reveal that, in India, there is a clear bias against DIY mainly on account of perceived lack of time and knowledge. But it is possible to define a demographic profile of people that will show the highest inclination towards DIY. The survey reveals that this profile varies depending on the type of the DIY activity (Electrical, <b>Plumbing,</b> <b>Indoor</b> Painting, Outdoor Painting, carpentry and Gardening). The final part of the research involves the formulation of a holistic marketing strategy, based on the research findings and the understanding of prevalent business models to service DIY in developed countries, to create and service demand for DIY products related to household painting and carpentry in India...|$|R
5|$|Patton {{was born}} in Fallsburg, Kentucky on May 26, 1937, in a {{retrofitted}} silo with no <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> electricity, or telephone. He was the only son of the three children born to Ward and Irene Patton. The family moved often because Ward Patton, a teacher, was assigned to a different school every year. When {{he was hired by}} a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky. He was an honor student, a member of the drama club, a football and baseball player, and class president during his senior year. In 1955, he graduated with the third-highest grade point average in his class of 73.|$|E
25|$|People wealthy {{enough to}} enjoy 19th century flush toilets often had the {{political}} power {{to allow them to}} drain into public sewers; and the practice became the norm as <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> became more common, based on large-scale supply networks such as the Croton Aqueduct in New York.|$|E
25|$|Pico House was {{a luxury}} hotel built in 1870 by PÃ­o Pico, a {{successful}} businessman {{who was the}} last Mexican Governor of Alta California. With <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> gas-lit chandeliers, a grand double staircase, lace curtains and a French restaurant, the Italianate three-story, 33-room hotel was the most elegant hotel in Southern California. It had a total of nearly eighty rooms. The Pico House is currently listed as a California Historical Landmark (No. 159).|$|E
25|$|The Roman Empire had <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> {{meaning a}} system of aqueducts and pipes that {{terminated}} in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use. Rome and other nations used lead pipes; while commonly {{thought to be the}} cause of lead poisoning in the Roman Empire, the combination of running water which did not stay in contact with the pipe for long and the deposition of precipitation scale actually mitigated the risk from lead pipes.|$|E
25|$|Housing in Port of Spain {{ranges from}} luxurious {{waterfront}} apartments to board houses lacking <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> and motor vehicular access. Continued pressure for expansion of commercial development in Woodbrook and uptown POS (Port of Spain proper) {{has led to}} a rapid rate of decline in the city's population over the past 4 decades. The private development scheme at Damien street Woodbrook recently provided 350 luxury-apartments, but those are unaffordable to most, even though they were originally intended for the general population.|$|E
25|$|Josephine lived {{her early}} life at 212 Targee Street (known by some St. Louis {{residents}} as Johnson Street) in the Mill Creek Valley neighborhood of St. Louis, a racially mixed low-income neighborhood near Union Station, consisting mainly of rooming houses, brothels and apartments with no <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing.</b> Josephine was always poorly dressed and hungry as a child, and developed street smarts {{playing in the}} railroad yards of Union Station. She had little formal education, and attended Lincoln Elementary School only through the fifth grade.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{wiring and}} <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> {{have been added}} to many mosques in Mali.

While the Great Mosque has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, the citizens of DjennÃ© have resisted modernization in favor of the building's historical integrity. Many historical preservationists have praised the community's preservation effort, and interest in this aspect of the building grew in the 1990s.|$|E

Jewel and her father sometimes earned a living by singing in bars and taverns. It was from these experiences she learned to yodel, which she does in many of her songs. Her father was a Mormon but they stopped attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shortly before she turned eight.|$|E
25|$|All {{group members}} were {{expected}} to work in common for the settlement. The women did domestic chores, while the men worked the farm and did some prospecting for gold, {{on a small scale}} and without much success. Water was scarce, but they installed a windmill-driven water pump and concrete cisterns for irrigating their fields. Members constructed the buildings themselves. There was no electricity or <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> consistent with their belief in material simplicity. They also made their own furniture and household goods by hand, supplemented by Ogden's occasional shopping trips to Monticello. Despite this spartan existence, the colony continually added new members, the population growing to around 100 at its height in 19345.|$|E
25|$|The Kamnas {{had four}} children, though one {{died in an}} {{accident}} at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to the barn, and around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> to the farmhouse, {{and in the process}} enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, rye grass, vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for sorting and packing the seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manningâ€“Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth of Virginia, {{initially}} led by {{efforts of}} Harry Flood Byrd, used the Great Depression {{and access to}} jobs and modern amenities such as <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> and public schools to help justify the controversial dislodging of the mountain residents. It {{is true that the}} development of the Park and the Skyline Drive created badly needed jobs for many Virginians during the Great Depression. Nearly 90% of the inhabitants of the land taken by the government worked the land for a living. Many worked in the apple orchards in the valley and in areas near the eastern slopes. The work to create the National Park and the Skyline Drive began following a terrible drought in 1930 that destroyed the crops of many families in the area who farmed in the mountainous terrain, as well as many of the apple orchards where they worked picking crops. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that they were displaced, often against their will, and even for the very few who managed to stay, their communities were lost.|$|E
25|$|Shipped by {{railroad}} boxcar, {{and then}} usually trucked {{to a home}} site, the average Sears Modern Home kit had approximately 25 tons of materials, with over 30,000 parts. Plumbing, electrical fixtures and heating systems {{were not included in}} the base price of the house but could be included, at an additional cost, with the house order. The Modern Homes features of central heating, <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing,</b> and electrical wiring were the first steps for many families to modern HVAC systems, kitchens, and bathrooms. During the Modern Homes program, large quantities of asphalt shingles became available. Asphalt shingles were cheap to manufacture and ship, and easy and inexpensive to install. A later feature was the use of drywall instead of the plaster and lath wall-building techniques which required skilled carpenters and plasterers. Drywall offered the advantages of low price, ease of installation, and added fire protection. Local building requirements sometimes dictated that certain elements of the house construction be done professionally and varied to meet requirements of each area of the country. For example, requirements for the depth of the foundation varied by climate and terrain and whether the house was being financed by Sears.|$|E
500|$|After an initial, {{disastrous}} {{experiment with}} prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, {{this time with}} [...] "every modern convenience", including <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken {{on the issue of}} racial discrimination.|$|E

500|$|In 1906, the {{dilapidated}} {{building was}} purchased by the San Diego Electric Railway Company, owned by prominent San Diego citizen John D. Spreckels (who also owned the Union). In his vision, the house would anchor a number of tourist attractions connected via his railway which would realize his twin goals of developing San Diego into a popular locale and generate revenue for his company. To this end, he hired architect Hazel Wood Waterman to renovate the house to a condition more closely matching descriptions in the novel. The original cupola and balcony was removed because there was none mentioned in the novel, and several doors and windows were moved. Waterman was exacting in her specifications: She wanted the building to look aged as well as have the [...] "charm {{of the work of}} half-skilled Indian hands", although modern conveniences such as electricity and <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> were included. Upon its completion in 1910, it was marketed as a Ramona-related tourist attraction, and remained popular as such for years to come, drawing 1,632 visitors on one day in 1940.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Greek {{civilization of}} Crete, {{known as the}} Minoan civilization, was the first civilization to use {{underground}} clay pipes for sanitation and water supply. [...] Their capital, Knossos, had a well-organized water system for bringing in clean water, taking out waste water and storm sewage canals for overflow when there was heavy rain. It {{was also one of}} the first uses of a flush toilet, dating back to 18th century BC. The Minoan civilization had stone sewers that were periodically flushed with clean water. In addition to sophisticated water and sewer systems they devised elaborate heating systems. The Ancient Greeks of Athens and Asia Minor also used an <b>indoor</b> <b>plumbing</b> system, used for pressurized showers.
