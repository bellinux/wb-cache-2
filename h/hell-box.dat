Fass' hobby was woodworking, so he created miniature wooden printing presses for his <b>Hell-Box</b> printing endeavors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930 Fass used his miniature, 14-inch-high presses to create booklets, bookplates, Christmas cards, and ephemera. He inked the letters with his fingertip.|$|E

[...] "Fass was essentially a private printer, working alone at his own pace. What he did was done for his own pleasure. But his work, small in size and issued in minuscule editions, was exquisite and executed with impeccable taste. He was a genius at the arrangement of type, ornaments, and wood engravings. Every piece he produced was a small gem, for Fass had the time, skill, and materials to print everything by hand patiently and perfectly," [...] according to collector Aveve Cohen.Despite Fass' modesty about his YMCA printing projects, his friends were determined to showcase Fass' exceptional printing work {{to the rest of}} New York. Friends of John Fass created several exhibits in New York during this era. John Archer organized an exhibition of <b>Hell-Box</b> Press and Hammer Creek Press imprints in 1953 for the New York Public Library. In 1962 Herman Cohen helped create an exhibition of Fass' work at New York's Grolier Club, the oldest American society of bibliophiles and book collectors. This was followed by an exhibition at the Cooper Union.|$|E
