40|$|This paper {{presents}} the effective fragmentation and flyrock control strategies {{that could be}} applied at quarries to improve the productivity and safety. Fragmentation measurement and modelling {{as well as a}} comprehensive drill and blast audit are essential for improving the fragmentation. <b>Face</b> <b>profiling</b> and bore tracking are good tools to manage the ―as-designed‖ and ―as-drilled‖ conditions to get reasonable fragmentation from face burden zone and minimise the flyrock risk. In general, a large scatter in fragmentation data was observed at sites and the causes should be analysed by a detailed root-cause analysis technique. Two case studies were presented in this paper showing some of the effective fragmentation strategies. Finally, a flyrock model was shown to determine the safe blast exclusion zone for the mining equipment and personnel. Some key guidelines were suggested to minimise the occurrence of the flyrock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. CCTV {{systems are}} broadly {{deployed}} in the present world. To ensure in-time reaction for intelligent surveillance, it is a fundamental task for real-world applications to determine the gender of people of interest. However, normal video algorithms for gender profiling (usually <b>face</b> <b>profiling)</b> have three drawbacks. First, the profiling result is always uncertain. Second, for a time-lasting gender profiling algorithm, the result is not stable. The degree of certainty usually varies, sometimes even {{to the extent that}} a male is classified as a female, and vice versa. Third, for a robust profiling result in cases were a person’s face is not visible, other features, such as body shape, are required. These algorithms may provide different recognition results- at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an eviden-tial approach that makes use of profiling results from multiple algorithms over a period of time.

These algorithms may provide different recognition results - at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidential approach that makes use of profiling results from multiple algorithms over a period of time, in particular, Denoeux’s cautious rule is applied for fusing mass functions through time lines. Experiments show that this approach does provide better results than single profiling results and classic fusion results. Furthermore, it is found that if severe mis-classification has occurred {{at the beginning of the}} time line, the combination can yield undesirable results. To remedy this weakness, we further propose three extensions to the evidential approach proposed above incorporating notions of time-window, time-attenuation, and time-discounting, respectively. These extensions also applies Denoeux’s rule along with time lines and take the DS approach as a special case. Experiments show that these three extensions do provide better results than their predecessor when mis-classifications occur...|$|E
40|$|<b>Face</b> <b>profile</b> is an {{important}} aspect of face recognition and it provides a complementary structure of the face that is seen in the non-frontal view. In the past, several methods have been proposed to recognize <b>face</b> <b>profiles</b> in still images. However, <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images that are captured at a distance by surveillance cameras usually are video sequences that have a low resolution. It is difficult to extract accurate <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> directly from a low-resolution video frame, which does not have many pixels on the <b>face</b> <b>profile.</b> The emphasis {{of this paper is to}} introduce a practical approach for human recognition by using high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images constructed from the low-resolution videos. We use both the spatial and temporal information present in a number of adjacent low-resolution frames of a video sequence to construct high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images. As the quality of high-resolution images relies on the correctness of image alignment between consecutive frames, an elastic registration algorithm is used for <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> image alignment. A match statistic is designed to detect and discard poorly aligned images which may degrade the quality of the high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> image. After obtaining high-resolution <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> images, we use a dynamic time warping method for <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> recognition. A number of dynamic video sequences are tested to demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our method. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> of the tool into the end section. In addition, the <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the <b>face</b> <b>profile,</b> the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is concerned with developing {{a greater understanding of}} piston ring lubrication and consists of both experimental and theoretical components. It begins with a review of piston ring and ring pack lubrication studies, describing how the understanding of the operation of piston rings has progressed since the late 19 th Century. A well-established method of analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication of a single piston ring, utilizing coordinate data to describe the ring <b>face</b> <b>profile,</b> is then presented. Calculation of mixed/boundary friction, when the lubricant film thickness falls below a pre-determined level, is included. The predictions of this program are then compared to results obtained by other workers to validate its operation. This analysis is then developed to investigate the influence of the circumferential variation in piston ring <b>face</b> <b>profile</b> on the lateral motion of the piston ring centre. The complex relationship between variation in ring <b>face</b> <b>profile,</b> angular ring gap position and bore shape is then examined. These features are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the calculation of ring centre locus, oil transport and lubricant film thicknesses. The model is then applied to predict the influence of the distorted bore shape of a cylinder from an experimental engine apparatus. Following this, the development, testing, calibration and performance of a capacitance based measurement system capable of recording piston ring <b>face</b> <b>profiles</b> on a single pass, is described. This system was used with twenty-one transducers, of novel design, to allow the axial and circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness to be monitored on an engine liner. This liner was fitted in an engine apparatus which had the additional facility of being able to measure the instantaneous friction between the piston assembly and cylinder liner using a "floating liner" technique. Experimental measurements of instantaneous friction force and the circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness are then compared to theoretical predictions for a range of operating conditions. The comparisons reveal a reasonable level of agreement between measurements with consistent overall trends. The effect of varying bore distortion is also examined theoretically. It is shown that an increase in the severity of bore distortion does not necessarily result in an increase in net oil transport...|$|R

This trend was fueled by two principles, namely: (1) an enriched variety of features when combined with classifiers having different statistical properties produce more accurate and more robust results. (2) Psychological findings show that humans equally rely on both local and global visual information [36]. Vandeborre et al. [37] fused local and global invariant descriptors of 3 D face data {{in the form of}} 1 D histograms of local surface curvatures, the distance between mesh triangles, and volumes of the tetrahedrons formed by the mesh triangles of the 3 D face Data.

METHODS: 21 patients (7 males and 14 females, mean age of 20. 6 years) were included in this study. Their dento-maxillofacial deformities following the repair of cleft lip and palate have been corrected in our hospital since 1996. Of them, 17 patients received pre- and postoperative orthodontic treatments. 21 cases underwent the following surgical procedures: Le Fort I osteotomy in 7 cases, multisegmental Le Fort I osteotomy in 5 cases, Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) in 4 cases, Le Fort I osteotomy and mandibular body osteotomy in 2 cases, BSSRO and genioplasty in 2 cases, BSSRO in 1 case. Rigid internal fixation was used in all patients. After multisegmental Le Fort I osteotomy, the rigid fixed palatine splint was used for 6 approximately 8 weeks. RESULTS: Osteotomy segments healed well in all cases without severe complications. 14 patients were followed-up {{for an average of}} 25. 6 months.
