40|$|Herring (Clupea harengus and C. pallasii) have an {{important}} socio-economic role worldwide and consist of diverse populations. These populations are distributed throughout both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Herring is a capital breeder with determinate fecundity. Fecundity can easily be determined due to the clear, group-synchronous oocyte developmental growth, where all the eggs of an individual are shed at once (total spawner). For methodological reasons, therefore, this pelagic fish species is an ideal candidate to identify factors affecting reproductive investment, both within and among the rich variety of <b>herring</b> <b>populations.</b> Another reason is {{that each of the}} Atlantic <b>herring</b> <b>populations</b> display a typical spawning time, spawning location, fecundity, and egg size. Several reproductive investment studies have been conducted with herring, but a common problem observed in previous studies was the lack of standardized methodologies. The main scope of this thesis was to elucidate the differences in life history traits, focusing mainly on reproductive investment between different oceanic and local Atlantic <b>herring</b> <b>populations,</b> using a consistent methodology. Overall, the main findings were that reproductive investment in <b>herring</b> <b>populations</b> differed particularly between spawning seasons and spatial location. Spring spawners produce large eggs in small numbers, and autumn and summer spawners produce a large number of small eggs. Fecundity, within spawning season, is size-dependent. However, within spring spawners the egg size was similar in both oceanic and local <b>herring</b> <b>populations.</b> Morphologically, three local herring (Lindås herring, Costal Skagerrak herring, and Landvik herring) were similar to the oceanic Northeast Atlantic <b>herring</b> <b>populations.</b> Special attention was given to the Norwegian spring-spawning herring (NSSH), where changes in the life history traits (body growth, body condition, reproductive investment, and trade-offs between fecundity and egg size) over the last 20 years were correlated with biotic and abiotic factors. Over this period, temperature has increased, zooplankton biomass has decreased, particularly from 2003 to 2009, and the sum of biomass of three pelagic stocks (herring, mackerel, and blue whiting) has increased. Therefore, these parameters were considered when analyzing the changes in life history traits. NSSH exhibited substantial physiological plasticity. This herring changed most of their life history traits to cope with dynamic biotic and abiotic changes in the Norwegian Sea. Body growth was the key trait affected, and this impacted other life history traits. Although, body growth decreased, NSSH maintained high body condition and invested more in reproduction. However, the egg production varied over the years. Interannual variation in NSSH fecundity was demonstrated to be driven by past and current food intake. Two processes were responsible for down-regulating fecundity: apoptosis during the oogenesis, and atresia during the vitellogenic stage. Therefore, two groups of females were established: females with high fecundity (“Good-seasons females”) and females with low fecundity (“Poor- and goodseasons females”). Furthermore, trade-offs between fecundity and egg size was identified. Oocytes grew faster and more in years with low fecundity compared to oocytes produced in years with high fecundity. The findings of this thesis clarify recent processes with NSSH, but also showed a broader perspective of how <b>herring</b> <b>populations</b> differ or resemble each other. Furthermore, the findings offer new insights into future application in the other herring reproductive studies, by providing more accurate information in total egg production. </p...|$|R

Through the analysis of 85 archaeological herring bones, this study attempted to reconstruct the genetic diversity and population structure of ancient <b>herring</b> <b>populations</b> using three different marker systems (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), microsatellites and SNPs). A high success rate (91 %) of DNA recovery was obtained from the extremely small herring bone samples (often < 10 mg). The ancient herring mtDNA revealed high haplotype diversity comparable to modern populations, although population discrimination was not possible due to the limited power of the mtDNA marker. Ancient microsatellite diversity was also similar to modern samples, but the data quality was compromised by large allele drop-out and stuttering. In contrast, SNPs were found to have low error rates with no evidence for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and simulations indicated high power to detect genetic differentiation if loci under selection are used. This study demonstrates that SNPs may be the most effective and feasible approach to survey genetic population structure in ancient remains, and further efforts should be made to screen for high differentiation markers. This study provides the much needed foundation for wider scale studies on temporal genetic variation in herring, with important implications for herring fisheries management, Aboriginal title rights and herring conservation...|$|R

At the 2013 [...] "Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference", oceanographer David Hollander presented data that showed as much as one-third of the oil released during the spill may still be in the gulf. Researchers described a phenomenon called [...] "dirty blizzard": oil caused deep ocean sediments to clumped together, falling to the ocean floor at ten times the normal rate in an [...] "underwater rain of oily particles". The result could have long-term effects on both humans and marine life. Commercially fished species feed on sediment creatures, meaning oil could remain in the food chain for generations. Concern was expressed for commercially fished species such as tilefish which burrow in the sediment and feed on sediment dwelling creatures. [...] In 2013 researchers found that a tiny amoeba-like creatures, foraminifera, that live in sediment and form the bottom of the gulf food chain, have died off in the areas that were affected by the underwater plumes that stretched out miles beyond the spill site. The foraminifera have returned in some areas but in other areas they have burrowed into the sediments, stirring them up all over again.
