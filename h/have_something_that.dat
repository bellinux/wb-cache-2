One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E

Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, but it’s just not her". Talking about his collaboration with Shakira, El Cata revealed that she told him [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> makes me move". Cata responded by telling Shakira that [...] "it was the percussion" [...] and [...] "Those sounds that you want, I have them in my studio.", {{which led to a}} recording session between the two.

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Joanna Johnston created 60 {{different versions}} of Ray's leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered {{from the beginning of}} the journey to the end. [...] "He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts," [...] explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: [...] "I wanted her to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face," [...] Johnston notes. [...] "That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times." [...] Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, [...] "They're more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface," [...] Johnston says.|$|E
500|$|Singer James Brown guest {{stars as}} himself. Brown makes an {{appearance}} at the [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival, during which he sings his 1965 song [...] "I Got You (I Feel Good)". After a bandstand collapses, he proclaims [...] "Hey, wait a minute, hold on here! This bandstand wasn't double-bolted!" [...] He described the experience as [...] "good, clean, and humorous. And we need more of that around." [...] According to Mirkin, the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them. They knew Brown would not be [...] "the greatest actor in the world" [...] but still [...] "gave him these incredibly hilarious, stiff lines that killed." [...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> just sounds perfectly wrong {{and it makes it}} funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of how}} the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E
500|$|The artwork for {{the cover}} and liner note booklet of Axe to Fall was {{designed}} and created by Jacob Bannon. The booklet features a different piece of artwork for each song on the album. Bannon tried to create images that [...] "encapsulated some of the emotion of each song" [...] in contrast to more literal imagery, such as avoiding an axe literally falling for the song [...] "Axe to Fall." [...] He also experimented with a technique where a single image would be repeated within a frame, but the copies would be distressed or slightly different. This {{could be seen in}} the cover art where a single image of a woman's profile was broken down within the repetition, and some of the copies showed the woman's teeth through her cheek. Bannon stated that {{for the cover}} art, he [...] "just wanted to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> felt timeless and sort of embodied the whole emotional gamut of the record, something that was explosive and powerful but also something that felt poetic and soft at the same time. It could look violent and beautiful at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> really works and {{we should be able to}} help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E
500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can <b>have,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as {{the lives of the people}} on the receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E

A fair exchange protocol would guarantee that, even if one of them maliciously deviates from the protocol, either both of them get the desired content, or neither of them do. It is known that no two-party protocol can guarantee fairness in general; therefore the presence of a trusted arbiter is necessary. In optimistic fair exchange, the arbiter only gets involved in case of faults, but needs to be trusted. To reduce the trust put in the arbiter, it is natural to consider employing multiple arbiters.

Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships.
