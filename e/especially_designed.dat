5|$|This {{series of}} {{successful}} British infantry and mounted operations {{resulted in the}} complete defeat of the 16,000 to 18,000 strong German, Austrian and Ottoman force, about half of whom were killed or wounded, and nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns, nine machine guns, a complete camel-pack machine gun company, 2,300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition, two complete field hospitals with all instruments, fittings and drugs, while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed. All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany, and the camel-pack machine gun company's equipment had been <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> for desert warfare. Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of rustless steel. Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9,000, while a German estimate put the loss at {{one third of the}} force (5,500 to 6,000), which seems low considering the number of prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Early Autodyne {{receivers}} {{typically used}} IFs of only 150nbsp&kHz or so, {{as it was}} difficult to maintain reliable oscillation if higher frequencies were used. As a consequence, most Autodyne receivers needed quite elaborate antenna tuning networks, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference. Later superhets used tubes <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> for oscillator/mixer use, which were able to work reliably with much higher IFs, reducing the problem of image interference and so allowing simpler and cheaper aerial tuning circuitry.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} ball game called batey. Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team {{and used a}} solid rubber ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well. The Classic Taíno played in the village's center plaza or on <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> rectangular ball courts called batey. Games on the batey {{are believed to have}} been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms' boundaries. Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game.|$|E

25|$|There were secret {{staircases}} {{and hidden}} spaces which {{were used to}} overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> to muffle {{the cries of the}} victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down. In a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, enlisted {{ranks in}} the Rhodesian Army wore a somber khaki drill. The Battle of Sinoia and the {{outbreak}} of the Rhodesian Bush War prompted security forces to devise a more appropriate uniform <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> for the region. This incorporated a three colour, high contrast, disruptive fabric with green and brown strokes on a sandy background. Early shortages of textile and equipment were overcome with South African and Portuguese technical assistance, and a home industry for the new battledress developed. The pattern was supposedly designed by Di Cameron of David Whitehead Textiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites and features landing gear <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> for training use. A ballistic parachute is standard equipment along with traditional and cheaper round-dial style flight instruments, rather than a glass cockpit. The design goals include economy of purchase and operation and its initial price of US$85,000 was intended to address moves by Pipistrel's competition in raising prices on their aircraft. In particular the Alpha's price was initially set well below the then-current US$149,000 price announced for the comparable Cessna 162, although by 2014 Pipistrel had raised the price to US$103,000. The fuel consumption is projected to be 2.5 US gallons per hour (9.5 litres per hour).|$|E

25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a microscope slide that is <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E

The film department has a wide variety of equipment and is currently developing green screening rooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the typhus vaccine involved several stages. First, the lice larvae had to be bred and then fed on human blood. Once they matured, they {{were removed from the}} feeders, held down in a clamp machine <b>especially</b> <b>designed</b> by Weigl, and anally injected with the strain of the typhus bacteria. At that point the infected louse had to be fed human blood for about five more days. This stage of the production process carried the greatest risk to the human feeder of contracting the disease. Weigl and his staff tried to prevent the danger by heavily vaccinating the feeders before hand. Once the louse was sufficiently infected, it was removed from the human feeder, killed in a solution of phenol, and then dissected. The contents of the louse abdomen (its feces) was removed and then ground up into a paste. The paste was then made into the typhus vaccine.|$|E
