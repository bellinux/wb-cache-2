5000|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> appears to have been low, approximately 5-10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crash-worthiness of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat. For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> have been developed by various manufacturers to protect their occupants from whiplash. Below are definitions of different types of <b>head</b> <b>restraints.</b> [...] <b>Head</b> <b>restraint</b> — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant’s head in relation to the torso {{in order to reduce the}} risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> must allow a backset motion of less than 60 mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact. Integrated <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> or fixed <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — refers to a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing”. [...] Adjustable <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — refers to a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. [...] Active <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — refers to a device designed to automatically improve <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position and/or geometry during an impact”. [...] Automatically adjusting <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — refers to a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> that automatically adjusts the position of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> when the seat position is adjusted. [...] A major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> where one can sufficiently protect one's head lower the chances of neck injury by up to 43% during a rear-end collision. In contrast to a properly adjusted <b>head</b> <b>restraint,</b> research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seat-back systems. [...] In most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes. Due to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.|$|R

40|$|Although <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> became {{mandatory}} {{in several countries}} during the 1960 s and 1970 s, the number of neck injuries is still rising, which indicates that current <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> are not giving sufficient protection. Despite numerous epidemiological and parameter studies, there are no methods to estimate in advance the potential neck injury risk reduction {{as a result of}} a better positioned <b>head</b> <b>restraint.</b> The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> on the long-term AIS I neck injury risk for real-life crash conditions. Madymo simulations of rear-end crashes were performed. The BioRID II seated in three car models was exposed to 20 recorded crash pulses with the potential to cause neck injuries. For each crash pulse, 132 <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> positions were analysed in terms of NICmax value and long-term AIS I neck injury risk. It was found that the optimal <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position for almost all crashes was that with zero backset and the top of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> at the same level as the top of the head. In general, the NICmax and the injury risk were primarily influenced by the backset and only to a small extent by the head-to-head-restraint height; the neck injury risk was reduced by 0. 1 for every 2. 5 cm decrease of the backset. The results of this study show that it is possible during the development phase to estimate the potential protection for redesigned or active <b>head</b> <b>restraints...</b>|$|R

For the volunteer simulations, initial seating posture and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position were found to strongly influence the model response. More leaning forward (increasing of horizontal distance <b>head</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint)</b> results in larger T 1 and head motions.
