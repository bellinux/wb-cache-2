2500|$|The {{first big}} {{scientific}} debate about Marx's economic theory, {{starting in the}} 1890s, was the so-called [...] "breakdown controversy", in which the tendency toward falling profitability played an important role.

He aimed to show with <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>figures</b> that Marx's analysis of the tendencies of capitalism {{had turned out to be}} partly wrong.

2500|$|In the United States {{the term}} is largely defined by the {{practices}} of the Medicare system and other health insurance providers, which make hospice care available, either in an inpatient facility or at the patient's home, to patients with a terminal prognosis who are medically certified at hospice onset to have {{less than six months}} to live. [...] According to the NHPCO [...] 2012 report on <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>figures</b> of Hospice care, 66.4% received care in their place of residence and 26.1% in a Hospice inpatient facility. [...] In the late 1970s the U.S. government began to view hospice care as a humane care option for the terminally ill. In 1982 Congress initiated the creation of the Medicare Hospice Benefit which became permanent in 1986. In 1993, President Clinton installed hospice as a guaranteed benefit and an accepted component of health care provisions. [...] Outside the United States, the term hospice tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care (although so-called [...] "hospice at home" [...] services may also be available). Outside the United States such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting, but they may also be available for patients with other specific palliative care needs. Hospice care also involves assistance for patients’ families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home. Although the movement has met with some resistance, hospice has rapidly expanded through the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Hodgson was not shy of publicity, and {{in another}} notable stunt, rode a bicycle down a street so steep that it had stairs, an event written up in the local paper. Despite his reputation, he {{eventually}} found {{that he could not}} earn a living running his personal training business, which was seasonal in nature, and shut it down. He began instead writing articles such as [...] "Physical Culture versus Recreative Exercises" [...] (published in 1903). One of these articles, [...] "Health from Scientific Exercise", featured photographs of Hodgson himself demonstrating his exercises. The market for such articles seemed to be limited, however; so, inspired by authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Arthur Conan Doyle, Hodgson turned his attention to fiction, publishing his first short story, [...] "The Goddess of Death", in 1904, followed shortly by [...] "A Tropical Horror" [...] (1905). He also contributed to an article in The Grand Magazine, taking the [...] "No" [...] side in a debate on the topic [...] "Is the Mercantile Navy Worth Joining?" [...] In this piece, Hodgson laid out in detail his negative experiences at sea, including <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>figures</b> about salaries. This led to a second article in The Nautical Magazine, an exposé on the subject of apprenticeships; at the time, families often were forced to pay to have boys accepted as apprentices.
