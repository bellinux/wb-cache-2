5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} with full camera control in most areas {{and the ability to}} use a first-person perspective for looking around a location, with the players able to use a widescreen mode, provided that their console is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a television set that has widescreen capabilities. The game's story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck {{in some sort of}} limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|As a {{precursor}} to the North American release, Gold and Silver were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 American International Toy Fair in New York City. To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five Chrysler PT Cruisers to resemble the new Pokémon Lugia and had them driven around the U.S.A. The vehicles had fins and tails attached to them and were painted with logos and images of the Pokémon franchise. In addition, they were equipped with a television set <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> game consoles which allowed spectators to play Pokémon Puzzle League, Hey You, Pikachu!, and Pokémon Gold and Silver. The television series Pokémon GS, based on the games, was announced {{to be a part}} of the fall lineup on Kids' WB. The show would feature the same protagonist Ash Ketchum in a new region with different Pokémon species from the games. The Americanized names of the 100 new Pokémon were kept confidential by Nintendo, with the company releasing names periodically. The domain names 'pokemongold.com' and 'pokemonsilver.com' were registered for this very purpose, and such names released included Chikorita, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Togepi, Hoothoot, and Marill.|$|E

25|$|Wang's {{first attempt}} at a word {{processor}} was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971, but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching.|$|E

25|$|Savage {{was known}} for his {{advertising}} skills and soon capitalized on Dan Patch's growing fame. Rather than charging an exhibition fee, Savage received a proportion of the gate receipts for crowds that grew to between 40 and 50 thousand. In most of his exhibition races, Dan Patch started behind galloping horses who were <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a sulky, which gave Dan Patch a target to beat and also acted as a wind breaker. The pace makers would eventually swing wide, leaving Dan Patch alone against the clock.|$|E
25|$|Compact Disc + Graphics is {{a special}} audio compact disc that {{contains}} graphics data {{in addition to the}} audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for karaoke performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.|$|E

25|$|The {{transplantation}} process starts {{after the}} donor lungs are inspected {{and the decision}} to transplant has been made. An incision is then made from under the patient's armpit, around to the sternum, and then back towards the other armpit; {{this is known as}} a clamshell incision. In the case of a sequential transplant the recipients lung with the poorest lung functions is collapsed, the blood vessels tied off, and cut at the corresponding bronchi. The new lung is then placed and the blood vessels reattached. To make sure the lung is satisfactory before transplanting the other a bronchoscopy is performed. When the surgeons are satisfied with the performance of the new lung, surgery on the second lung will proceed. In 10% to 20% of double-lung transplants the patient is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a heart-lung machine which pumps blood for the body and supplies fresh oxygen.|$|E

C6-C9 all contain a common MACPF domain. This region is homologous to cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria.|$|R
500|$|The {{brain in}} a vat {{argument}} {{has also been}} subject to criticism. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—prior to her [...] "envatment" [...] by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., [...] "tree" [...] and [...] "grass") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment. In another scenario, a brain in a vat may be <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a supercomputer that randomly generates perceptual experiences. In this case, one's words and thoughts would not refer to anything, and would therefore be devoid of content. Semantics would no longer exist and the argument would be meaningless.|$|E
500|$|Thompson led his platoon in {{an attack}} against the nearby bridge {{spanning}} the Maas River, which was defended by German forces supplemented by two 20mm flak guns, one on the close {{side of the bridge}} and one across the river. The platoon opened fire on the German forces, killing four. Two trucks of German soldiers arrived on the scene, but they [...] "showed no desire to fight... ran away". Thompson's platoon destroyed [...] "electrical equipment and cables that they expected were <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> demolitions", and their bazooka operator destroyed the nearer flak gun, permitting the establishment of a roadblock on the bridge while waiting {{for the remainder of the}} 82nd Airborne. After the battle at the Maas bridge, Thompson also participated in the Battle of the Bulge, where he was given a field commission, and during the Allied occupation of Berlin, where he served as an aide to General James M. Gavin.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair's {{first home}} {{computer}} was the MK14, which {{was launched in}} kit form in June 1978. It {{was a long way}} from being a mass-market product. Its very name – MK standing for [...] "Microcomputer Kit" [...] – was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists. It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard. Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10–15,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.|$|E
