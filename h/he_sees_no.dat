5|$|D0g {{retrieves}} Gordon {{out from}} under some junk outside the Citadel, and Gordon reunites with Alyx, who is relieved to see him. Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could {{be large enough to}} level the whole of City 17, and the only way for them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> other option.|$|E
500|$|Lucas confesses {{that people}} were disappointingly upset about the CGI Jabba's appearance, {{complaining}} that the character [...] "looked fake". Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is ultimately portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, {{it will always be}} [...] "fake" [...] since the character is ultimately not real. He says <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer.|$|E
500|$|Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar praised Trevor {{for being}} the first {{character}} in the series that [...] "makes sense". He stated that, upon their first playthrough of a Grand Theft Auto game, most players [...] "carjacked some poor schlub, then started doing 90mph on the sidewalk, mowing over civilians", as opposed to playing peacefully. [...] "Trevor's existence isn't a commentary on any group of people–he's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing GTA games for the past decade," [...] he said. Sullivan concluded that Trevor {{is one of the}} few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence. Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films. Calvin Khan of IGN compared Trevor to Heath Ledger's Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in Grand Theft Auto V not trying to fake his persona, stating [...] "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy." [...] He also felt that Trevor's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it's just too much fun not to. Khan concluded saying that it's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> harm in messing it up some more, hence the reason for Trevor's actions.|$|E

[...] She described Dunn as [...] "a good man. He's not a racist. He's very loving." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Pierce Penniless is told by Pierce himself, {{who is a}} scholar, author and poet. [...] He begins his story by bewailing his own lack of good fortune, saying [...] " ... have I more wit than all these (thought I to myself)? Am I better born, am I better brought up, yea, and better favoured, and yet am I a beggar?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> {{solution}} and finds that wickedness prevails. [...] "Divines and dying men may talk of hell," [...] he says, [...] "but in my heart her several torments dwell." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{he visited}} Iowa in 2009, there was {{speculation}} that Barbour might {{run for the}} Republican nomination for U.S. President in 2012. An advisor of Barbour stated, [...] "When he surveys what most Republicans {{consider to be a}} weak field, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> reason he couldn't easily beat them. He's a better strategist and fundraiser than any other candidate currently considering running—and just as good on television and in debates." [...] While considering a potential run, Barbour stated forthrightly in February 2011, [...] "I'm a lobbyist", and said that his K Street past prepared him for the job.|$|E

When Mr. De Pinna looks out the window, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> one other than a man walking away. Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr. De Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr. De Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started {{of him as a}} discus thrower. [...] Mr. De Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. [...] She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr. De Pinna leaves to put on his costume.|$|E

2500|$|Hacking called Stein's book an [...] "encyclopedic study", [...] "an {{authoritative}} {{history of}} twentieth century scientific approaches to sexual orientations", and [...] "a rich body of analysis, distinctions and arguments." [...] Hacking credited Stein {{with being the}} first philosopher to expose the confusions involved in asking whether homosexuality is a natural kind. However, he criticized Stein for defining natural kinds through reference {{to the work of}} the philosopher Hilary Putnam, while adopting only a single theme from Putnam's theory that does properly convey Putnam's view. Hacking also found some of Stein's claims about natural kinds confusing, and questioned the idea of the natural kind was useful for Stein’s purposes, Stein's use of his ideas, as well as his uses of the terms [...] "essentialism" [...] and [...] "constructionism". Stein replied to Nussbaum and Hacking, writing that while they both claimed that he believes that the question of whether sexual orientations are natural human kinds is relevant to ethical and legal issues, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>no</b> such connection.|$|E
