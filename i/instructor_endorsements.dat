It was originally created for flying small single-engine planes for personal enjoyment; the newer Sport Pilot certificate overlaps this need and {{is easier to}} get, but the recreational certificate allows access to larger single-engine aircraft, and <b>instructor</b> <b>endorsements</b> are available to {{recreational pilot}}s that are not applicable to sport pilots, such as flying at night or cross-country.

These are often interpreted to mean [...] "have an <b>instructor's</b> <b>endorsement</b> for having been properly trained in that specific class B space". However, it {{does not apply to}} student pilots seeking sport or recreational certificates. Some class B airports (within class B airspaces) prohibit student pilots from taking off and landing there.|$|R

A yearly Flight Instructor Recertification Course (FIRC) will also suffice.|$|R
