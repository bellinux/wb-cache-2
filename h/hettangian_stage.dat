5|$|It {{was long}} assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the {{lowermost}} (earliest) {{part of the}} Jurassic (the <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stage)</b> or at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, approximately 200 million years ago. Therefore, it was regarded as the earliest sauropod known, until {{the discovery of the}} even older Late Triassic Isanosaurus was announced in 2000. Adam Yates (2004) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought, dating to the uppermost (latest) part of the Lower Jurassic during the Toarcian stage, approximately 175–183 million years ago. – thus, it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus. Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas, it would roughly be a contemporary to Karoo lavas from other localities, as the entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years.|$|E
5|$|Quarries of {{the local}} blue lias stone were worked from {{as early as the}} 12th century {{to the end of the}} 19th century. It is a {{geological}} formation in southern England, part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geologic timescale, thus fully including the <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stage.</b> It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone. The Blue Lias contains many fossils, especially ammonites. Fossils discovered in the lias include many ichthyosaurs, one of which has been adopted as the badge of Street. There is a display of Street fossils in the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHydrogeochemical {{processes}} {{associated with}} the potential seasonal storage of 90 °C hot water in a Lower Jurassic aquifer (Lower Sinemurian/ <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stages)</b> {{in the city of}} Berlin, Germany, are characterized and evaluated to determine possible sources of mineral precipitation resulting in aquifer damage (clogging). Laboratory leaching tests with material from the sandstone aquifer and the pelitic hanging aquiclude obtained from the wellbore “Am Reichstag 2 / 98 ” were conducted over a period of 28 days under anoxic conditions. A hydrogeochemical batch reaction simulation of the leaching test was set up with the commercial software PHREEQC and matched to the experimental results. Laboratory experiments show a strong pH decrease and sulfur mobilization as well as precipitation of reddish-brown iron hydroxides. This is most likely the consequence of pyrite oxidation. PHREEQC simulations can reproduce acidification and hematite precipitation if a minor diffusion of oxygen into the system is assumed...|$|R

25|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the actual base of the <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stage,</b> and so of the Jurassic system itself.

2500|$|From the {{earliest}} Jurassic, the <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stage,</b> a rich radiation of plesiosaurs is known, {{implying that the}} group must already have diversified in the Late Triassic; of this diversification, however, only a few very basal forms have been discovered. The subsequent evolution of the plesiosaurs is very contentious. The various cladistic analyses have not resulted in a consensus about {{the relationships between the}} main plesiosaurian subgroups. Traditionally, plesiosaurs have been divided into the long-necked Plesiosauroidea and the short-necked Pliosauroidea. However, modern research suggests that some generally long-necked groups might have had short-necked members. To avoid confusion between the phylogeny, the evolutionary relationships, and the morphology, the way the animal is built, long-necked forms are therefore called [...] "plesiosauromorph" [...] and short-necked forms are called [...] "pliosauromorph", without the [...] "plesiosauromorph" [...] species necessarily being more closely related to each other than to the [...] "pliosauromorph" [...] forms.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} mass extinctions {{took place at the}} Triassic-Jurassic Boundary. It {{affected}} both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and caused the disappearance of many animal taxa, mostly marine ones. Its influence on floral changes has been widely discussed, with arguments offered for the sudden mass extinction of plants over vast areas, or, alternatively, for slow, less extensive changes. The aim {{of this study was to}} statistically verify changes in terrestrial plant composition during the TJB in Europe, and to examine the type and extent of these changes. Data from Polish localities, an interesting new addition to the floristic data from the TJB, were compared with those from other selected localities in Europe. The database contains 311 macroflora taxa from 106 localities (16 Polish) in 13 countries, grouped into 29 regions; and 571 microflora taxa from 105 localities (29 Polish) in 11 countries, grouped into 37 regions. The analysed data cover the period from the Anisian to the Toarcian stages. Range-based metrics for diversity dynamics were calculated to show trends in floral changes during the studied time interval, the focus being on the TJB. Due to strong disproportions in the number of localities and occurrences, the Rhaetian and the <b>Hettangian</b> <b>stages</b> were overrepresented. The warm and humid climate of those stages promoted plant diversity and led to the formation of numerous broad floodplains conducive to the preservation of remains (e. g. in coal). The patterns established by the raw data analyses were also assessed by applying a sampling standardisation procedure. Our results, based on accurate data from Poland and the rest of Europe, confirm and visualize a scenario in which there were no significant changes in terrestrial plant composition at the TJB. Hierarchical clustering suggests that local habitat conditions are the key factor in the grouping of localities with similar floristic composition, and that differences between floras are not associated with the time dimension (stages) ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws.
