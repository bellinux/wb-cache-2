40|$|This is {{the first}} {{reported}} detailed electrophysiological study of diaphragmatic myoclonus. An 86 year old woman had rapid, intermittent epigastric pulsations. Neurological examination and imaging studies {{of the brain and}} spinal cord were normal. Needle EMG showed rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles at 4 to 5 Hz. These contractions were often associated with suppression of normal breathing and were capable of maintaining adequate ventilation. Both diaphragms were involved but showed considerable variability in their relative latencies. Automated interference pattern analysis suggested a change in recruitment order, with selective activation of large phrenic motoneurons. The supraspinal mechanisms mediating diaphragmatic myoclonus are different from that of voluntary and involuntary rhythmic breathing, and seem to be unrelated to palatal myoclonus.

Due to poor absorber performance, increasing solution temperatures and mass flow rates did not result in a proportional desorber vapor generation enhancement, leading to a reduction in desorber quality difference...|$|E

An apparent disadvantage {{of this approach}} is that the programmer is bound to both the expressivity and performance characteristics of the base language.

In addition, compared to an explicitly heterogeneous approach, it promotes reuse of <b>generator</b> <b>source</b> code and systematic exploration of the performance characteristics of the target languages.

40|$|Abstract. An {{efficient}} renewable {{green energy}} system consisting a hydrogen PEM-fuel cell as an energy sources is simulated and studied in this paper. The proposed green scheme has four separate key components. The {{first is the}} green power generation source. The second is the interfacing DC-DC converter used to connect green power generator fuel cell to the load bus. The third is a common DC interface-bus where the generated energy is collected in a DC form. The fourth comprises all interfacing error driven controllers and novel modulated green plug power filter (GPPF) used to reduce ripple variations and stabilize the common DC-Bus voltage. In this paper, the novel multi-loop error driven dynamic controller scheme is implemented for speed control of the PMDC motor. This multi-loop controller comprises three basic loops, the main supplementary dynamic momentum loop to ensure fast dynamic and minimum current and torque ripple content. The proposed fuel cell generation scheme provides efficient and optimum dynamic operation to enhance system performance and secure energy supply. The proposed integrated hybrid system with all subsystems has been simulated using the Matlab Simulink/Sim-Power software environment and validated for voltage stabilization, efficient utilizations and enhanced power quality under different operating conditions, sudden load excursions, despite the non-linear volt-ampere characteristic of the fuel cell DC <b>generator</b> <b>source</b> [...] Key word...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} tomographic imaging capabilities for fissile object identification. The tomographic capabilities add object {{spatial and}} material properties information {{that result in}} a more detailed item signature (template) and provide more information for physical attributes analyses. One method of examining fissile objects in sealed containers is through a radiation signature acquired by shining a 252 Cf or DT <b>generator</b> <b>source</b> through the container and measuring the resulting radiation at detectors on the other side. This measurement gives a gamma and/or neutron radiation transmission profile of the object, mixed with the radiation produced by the induced fissions in any fissile materials. Whereas the method above measures the fissile object at a single position, tomography images the interior of an item by making transmission measurements from all angles around the object. The advantage is more geometric and materials property information. The tomographic image provides {{more information about the}} geometry of the object, which should lead to better interpretation of the radiation signature. Interrogating with both gamma rays and neutrons of varying energies allows the system to construct separate tomographic views of the object’s approximate gamma and neutron interaction properties (cross sections). The combination of geometric and materials property information will result in better template matching and attributes analysis. The paper presents Monte Carlo simulations illustrating this technique...|$|E
