40|$|Noncoplanar {{compressible}} reconnection {{theory is}} combined here with simple scaling arguments for ablation and radiative cooling to predict average properties of hot and cool flare loops {{as a function}} of the coronal vector magnetic field. For a coronal field strength of 100 G, the temperature of the hot flare loops decreases from 1. 2 x 10 to the 7 th K to 4. 0 x 10 to the 6 th K as the component of the coronal magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the loops increases from 0 percent to 86 percent of the total field. When the perpendicular component exceeds 86 percent of the total field or when the altitude of the reconnection site exceeds 10 to the 6 th km, flare loops no longer occur. Shock-enhanced radiative cooling triggers the formation of cool H-alpha flare loops with predicted densities of roughly 10 to the 13 th/cu cm, and a small gap of roughly 1000 km is predicted to exist between the footpoints of the cool flare loops and the inner <b>edges</b> of the <b>flare</b> ribbons...|$|R

40|$|We have {{calculated}} the Hα and Ca ii 8542 ˚A line profiles based on four different atmospheric models, including {{the effects of}} nonthermal electron beams with various energy fluxes. These two lines have different responses to thermal and nonthermal effects, {{and can be used}} to diagnose the thermal and nonthermal heating processes. We apply our method to an X-class flare that occurred on 2001 October 19. We are able to identify quantitatively the heating effects during the flare eruption. We find that the nonthermal effects at the outer <b>edge</b> of the <b>flare</b> ribbon are more notable than that at the inner edge, while the temperature at the inner edge seems higher. On the other hand, the results show that nonthermal effects increase rapidly in the rise phase and decrease quickly in the decay phase, but the atmospheric temperature can still keep relatively high for some time after getting to its maximum. For the two kernels that we analyze, the maximum energy fluxes of the electron beams are ∼ 10 10 and 10 11 ergs cm − 2 s − 1, respectively. However, the atmospheric temperatures are not so high, i. e., lower than or slightly higher than that of the weak flare model F 1 at the two kernels.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the origin and even the very {{existence}} of a high degree of linear polarization of some chromospheric spectral lines observed in solar flares. The standard explanation of these measurements is in terms of the impact polarization caused by non-thermal proton and/or electron beams. In this work, we study the possible role of resonance line polarization due to radiation anisotropy in the inhomogeneous medium of the flare ribbons. We consider a simple two-dimensional model of the flaring chromosphere and we solve self-consistently the non-LTE problem taking into account the role of resonant scattering polarization and of the Hanle effect. Our calculations show that the horizontal plasma inhomogeneities at the boundary of the flare ribbons can lead to a significant radiation anisotropy in the line formation region and, consequently, to a fractional linear polarization of the emergent radiation of the order of several percent. Neglecting the effects of impact polarization, our model can provide a clue for resolving some of the common observational findings, namely: (1) why a high degree of polarization appears mainly at the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flare</b> ribbons; (2) why polarization can also be observed during the gradual phase of a flare; (3) why polarization is mostly radial or tangential. We conclude that the radiation transfer in the realistic multi-dimensional models of solar flares needs to be considered as an essential ingredient for understanding the observed spectral line polarization.

We present high-time-resolution spectrophotometry of the eclipsing nova-like variables SW Sex and DW UMa, two of the founding members of the SW Sex class.
