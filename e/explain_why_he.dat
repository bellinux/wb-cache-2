5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which could <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E

5|$|All NIU Huskie {{sporting}} events, {{home and}} away, through Sunday were canceled. Most students left campus for the weekend. A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire. Investigators were expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E
5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> deserted the army, with Kevin {{telling him that}} he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, {{but it does}} not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|E
5|$|Captain America {{was put on}} hold {{during the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim {{comprehensive}} agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company's development. On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E

25|$|In September 2008, Vaz faced {{pressure}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> failed to declare an interest when he intervened {{in an official}} investigation into the business dealings of a close friend, solicitor Shahrokh Mireskandari, who has {{played a role in}} several racial discrimination cases against the Metropolitan Police, and who was representing Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his racial discrimination case against Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Ian Blair.|$|E
25|$|Biographers {{differ on}} what {{was the basis for}} this arrangement. Little Leopold was ill in his infancy, and perhaps needed to be kept in Salzburg for this reason, but this does not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was still kept there after his recovery. Another {{possibility}} attributes the arrangement to Marianne's delicate health or her {{need to take care of}} her stepchildren. Biographer Maynard Solomon attributes the arrangement to Leopold's wish to revive his skills in training a musical genius, as he had done with Wolfgang. He also suggests that giving up her son was indicative of Marianne's total subordination to her father's wishes.|$|E

25|$|He {{was one of}} the 12 sons of Cennétig mac Lorcáin (d. 951), king of Dál gCais {{and king}} of Tuadmumu (Thomond), modern County Clare, then a sub-kingdom in the north of Munster. Cennétig was {{described}} as rígdamna Caisil, meaning that he was either heir or candidate ("king material") to the kingship of Cashel or Munster, although this might be a later interpolation. Brian's mother was Bé Binn inion Urchadh, daughter of Urchadh mac Murchadh (d. 945), king of Maigh Seóla in west Connacht. That they belonged to the Uí Briúin Seóla may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> received the name Brian, which was rare among the Dál gCais.|$|E
25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> decided to do so. It would {{not seem to have}} been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Fr. Giovanni Zucca from Murialdo, who {{was then}} the {{chaplain}} at Murialdo when Dominic was five years old, notes in a statement to John Bosco that he came to notice Dominic due to his regular church attendance with his mother, and his habit of kneeling down outside the church to pray (even in the mud or snow) if he happened to come to Church before it had been unlocked in the morning. The chaplain also notes that Savio made good progress at the village school not merely due to his cleverness, but also by working hard. He would not join the other boys in doing something that he believed to be morally wrong and would <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> thought a particular deed was wrong. At the age of five, he learned to serve Mass, and would try to participate at Mass every day as well as go regularly to Confession. Having been permitted to make his First Communion at an early age, he had much reverence for the Eucharist.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer {{has a right to}} have the IRS <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury to the taxpayer, as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E
25|$|William Mycroft (1 February 1841 – 19 June 1894) was an English cricketer {{who played}} first class cricket for Derbyshire and MCC between 1873 and 1886. He was a left-arm fast bowler {{with a great}} deal of spin and a {{dangerous}} yorker that was often believed to be unfair – which may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was not considered for the earliest Test Matches despite being in his prime. He took 863 first class wickets at an average of 12.09 with 87 five-wicket innings and 28 ten-wicket matches in his career. His first ten-wicket match in 1875 against Nottinghamshire became the first of six in only nine games that season. He holds the Derbyshire record for most wickets in a single match, with figures of 17–103 against Hampshire at the Antelope Ground, Southampton in July 1876. This is one of only two times a player has taken seventeen wickets in a match and finished on the losing side – the other, by Walter Mead in 1895 was also against Hampshire. Mycroft had no pretensions as a right-handed tail end batsman: he scored only 791 first class runs at an average of 5.34 and prior to Alf Hall and Father Marriott remained the last significant cricketer who took more wickets than he scored runs.|$|E
25|$|On another {{modeling}} shoot, Erica has {{an accident}} and suffers injuries to her back. With the help of Dr. Jonathan Kinder, she becomes addicted to the medication she takes for her injury. Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica has no idea what Jonathan did or why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was wronged by Kinder) corner Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand on the women and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|E
