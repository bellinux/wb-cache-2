Continuing education is usually conducted through the funds of companies, institutions, the Employment Fund, other funds, or personal funds of pupils. Requirements for vocational training programmes are set out by the General Requirements and Standards for Vocational Training of the Ministry of Education and Science. Vocational training programmes are developed by vocational training providers in cooperation with employers.|$|E

30|$|Numerous past studies {{dealing with}} the {{transition}} into <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> in Germany have shown that young people with migration backgrounds have significantly poorer chances of ending up in in-company <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> than those without migration backgrounds. The present article investigates whether possible deviations in career interests could explain the different chances of transition. Given that occupational preferences are still {{to a large extent}} influenced by a person’s gender, distinctions are made in the analyses between male and female migrants and men and women without migration backgrounds. The underlying data is based on the representative surveys of reported training place applicants which were conducted in 2010 and 2012 by the Federal Institute for <b>Vocational</b> Education and <b>Training</b> (BIBB) in cooperation with the Federal Employment Agency (BA) (BA/BIBB Surveys of Applicants 2010 and 2012). With regard to deviations in career interests, the results show that young people with migration backgrounds are significantly more interested in service occupations than young people without migration backgrounds. This applies to men and women equally. However, the analyses show that migrants have poorer chances of transition into in-company <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> even if the differences in career interests are taken into account. On the other hand, the different chances of transition of men and women can be attributed clearly to the deviations in career interests – both for migrants and non-migrants.|$|R

50|$|Up to {{the early}} 1990s, however, {{mobility}} in VET - and in particular in initial VET and for young workers - was very limited and certainly not a realistic proposition except for a very small minority {{of the total population}} engaged in VET. Mobility took a quantum leap upwards on the agenda of European and national VET-policies more or less precisely a decade ago, notably with the introduction of the enlarged Petra programme (Petra II) in 1992. That year, 8500 placements were grant-aided through the programme, {{and by the end of}} the programme period in 1995, the total number approached 35 000 for the then 12 EU Member States. A significant development at national level was the establishment by the Danish government in 1992 of the PIU programme, which gave people in <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> not just the opportunity but the right to undertake all or part of their mandatory work placements in another EU or EFTA country. Funding was provided by Danish employers through the Employers’ reimbursement scheme for apprentices and trainees (AER). This was the first of several national programmes for placements abroad that have since been set up in various countries.|$|E
50|$|Quantifiable {{information}} on spontaneous mobility is virtually non-existent, {{even though we}} have anecdotal evidence of its existence as a factor. We might have got an indication of sorts from the German Sprungbrett programme; a national-level mobility programme which started in 2003, which gave grants to individuals within initial VET undertaking placement periods in other European countries. Unfortunately this programme was discontinued at the end of 2003 due to budget cuts.Measuring the factors such as the numbers of applications received may give us a rough estimate of this activity in at least one Member State, but only in <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training,</b> where spontaneous mobility is likely to be low for reasons of age. Almost equally impossible to assess are the activities that are undertaken as pilot projects within programmes that on the surface {{have nothing to do with}} the issue of placements abroad.An example of this is the Eurojoker project, which was financed out of funds from the EU Konver II initiative. In this project (duration March 1999 - May 2000) young unemployed persons from the Brandenburg region in Germany were sent on one year placements in other European countries with a view to increasing their employability. Locating such projects mainly relies on the unofficial network of the person collecting the data, or happens by chance. It follows that any estimate of the numbers and amounts involved will doubtless be inaccurate. The scarcity of data is equally pronounced for the qualitative aspects of the phenomenon. Given the scope of activities, it is strange to note that studies on the qualitative aspects of placements abroad as a didactic tool in the context of VET are sparse.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} impact of recent {{attempts}} to reform Russia's system of <b>Initial</b> <b>Vocational</b> Education and <b>Training</b> (IVET). Having become dislocated from industry {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, <b>Vocational</b> <b>Training</b> Colleges (Profuchilishche, or PU) 1 recently became the subject of decentralizing reforms intended to make them more responsive to local labour market demand. Drawing on research conducted in the Ul'yanovsk region of Russia in 2004, the paper argues that in some respects the system has become more flexible. However, the reform process as a whole, particularly in its emphasis on `social partnership', is too dependant on change taking place spontaneously. Qualitative change is further hindered by continuing efforts to engender an excessively close fit between labour market supply and demand, a tendency that owes its rationale to Soviet-era planning, and which ignores the way many graduates of PU approach their transitions into work...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{comparative}} research has uncovered considerable cross-country differences in occupational gender segregation. There is, however, {{a lack of}} research on the role of educational systems in the creation of gender segregation and gendered school-to-work transitions. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the role of vocational education and the strength of the education–employment linkage in the transmission of horizontal gender segregation from education into the labour market. Transition system literature points to a stronger linkage between education and employment in countries where <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> dominates the educational offers, and to a weaker linkage in countries with a stronger focus on general education. Moreover, research on gender segregation in education shows that segregation is especially pronounced in educational systems with a strong <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> sector on the upper secondary level. Based on these insights, we hypothesize that gender segregation in education and its transmission to employment is more pronounced the more distinct a country’s <b>initial</b> <b>vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> system is. To test our assumption, we compare individual school-to-work transitions in Switzerland and Bulgaria, with the vocational principle being more prevalent in the structuring of Swiss educational offers. We use data from the Swiss Youth Panel Survey TREE (N[*]=[*] 3215) and the Bulgarian School Leaver Survey BSLS (N[*]=[*] 885). Following recent developments in multi-group segregation research, entropy-based measurements are calculated to study the school-to-work linkages and the transmission of gender segregation in the two select countries. The empirical results confirm a more pronounced educational gender segregation in Switzerland, which is transferred more strongly into the labour market due to the tighter linkage in that country between education and employment compared to Bulgaria.|$|R

The initiative explores and evaluates the benefits of tangible user interfaces (TUIs) to help carpenter apprentices learn their trade. TUIs are special kinds of computer interfaces that allow the user to control the computer through the manipulation of physical objects (Ishii and Ullmer [15]). The rationale behind using TUIs in the context of VET is that they are allow apprentices to continue to learn in a similar way as they currently do, that is with concrete learning material and hands-on activities (e.g. Manches and O’ Malley [20]; Do-Lenh et al. [6]).|$|R
