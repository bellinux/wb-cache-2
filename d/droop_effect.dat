30|$|By {{modulating}} the indium {{composition in}} the quantum barriers of InGaN-based LEDs, {{the influence of}} electron distribution, electron overflow and Auger recombination on the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> have been investigated. Experimental results as well as numerical simulations reveal that the electron distribution is the key factor to influence both the peak efficiency and <b>droop</b> <b>effect.</b> The {{results show that the}} high electron concentration in the individual quantum well can stimulate the Auger recombination and lead to the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> instead of the total effective electron concentration, which is more related to the external quantum efficiency. If we modulate the indium composition in the quantum barriers of the InGaN-based LEDs, a uniform electron distribution can be achieved, which can not only enhance the EQE but also avoid the Auger recombination and improve the <b>droop</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
30|$|As for LED I, {{because of}} GaN barrier layer, the {{electron}} {{concentration in the}} individual quantum wells of MQWs is larger, and the Auger recombination dominate at the high current density, therefore, it has the biggest <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> for these three LEDs. While for LED III, because of the serious electron overflow, both the electron concentration in the individual quantum well {{as well as the}} total effective carrier concentration in the MQWs are the smallest, so the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> can be improved, but the EQE will be influenced. For LED II, electron concentration in the individual quantum well becomes more uniform which will minimize the Auger recombination and improve <b>droop</b> <b>effect.</b> In addition, the less carrier confinement will also allow the MQWs tolerant more total effective carrier concentration and lead to a higher EQE.|$|E

But for these applications, LEDs need to be operated at a current density below 10 A/cm 2 because of <b>droop</b> <b>effect,</b> which is still a key problem obstructing the development of high-power lighting-emitting diodes. Till now, lots of mechanisms have already been suggested to explain the “efficiency droop”, such as polarization effect [1, 2], electron leakage out of the active region [3, 4], carrier delocalization [5], carrier injection efficiency [6], Auger recombination [7] and defects [5]. But the physical mechanisms of the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> aren’t entirely clear and there is still a debate between them. In this study, we try to understand the relationship between these suggested mechanisms behind the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> and our findings will pave a way to further increase the EQE of LEDs at high current density.|$|E

30|$|From above, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} with the indium {{composition}} increasing in the quantum barriers, the bandgap discontinuity will be decreased, which will increase the carrier transport between quantum wells and tolerant more carrier concentrations, therefore the peak efficiency shift to high current. With the current density increasing, if the electron concentration in the single quantum well is high, the Auger recombination would be resulted, which would lead to the <b>droop</b> <b>effect,</b> so in this case, it indicates that electron distribution may be one of key factors, which may both influence the peak efficiency and droop effects. With appropriate indium composition in the quantum barriers, the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> of GaN-based LEDs can also be improved, and the reason may be due to more uniformed electron distribution and high effective electron concentration.|$|E

40|$|Background: Expression {{of double}} strand RNA (dsRNA) {{designed}} against important insect genes in transgenic {{plants have been}} shown to give protection against pests through RNA interference (RNAi), thus opening the way {{for a new generation of}} insect-resistant crops. We have earlier compared the efficacy of dsRNAs/siRNAs, against a number of target genes, for interference in growth of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) upon oral feeding. The v-ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) coding gene was identified as a crucial target. We now report the effectiveness of transgenic tobacco plants expressing siRNA to silence v-ATPaseA gene expression for the control of whitefly infestation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Transgenic tobacco lines were developed for the expression of long dsRNA precursor to make siRNA and knock down the v-ATPaseA mRNA in whitefly. Molecular analysis and insecticidal properties of the transgenic plants established the formation of siRNA targeting the whitefly v-ATPaseA, in the leaves. The transcript level of v-ATPaseA in whiteflies was reduced up to 62 % after feeding on the transgenic plants. Heavy infestation of whiteflies on the control plants caused significant loss of sugar content which led to the drooping of leaves.

30|$|In summary, by {{changing}} the indium composition in the barriers of InGaN/GaN MQWs, we investigated {{the influence of the}} carrier distribution as well as the corresponding electron overflow and Auger recombination on the efficiency droop. The InGaN quantum barriers with 7  % indium can improve the efficiency droop but decrease the EQE due to the serious electron overflow; the InGaN quantum barriers with 3  % indium can provide a uniform electron distribution, which can not only improve the EQE, but decrease the <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> compared with the conventional LEDs using the GaN QWs. The results show that the correlation between the electron overflow, electron distribution and Auger recombination. Electron overflow seems mainly influence the peak efficiency, while Auger recombination is the main factor which will determine the efficiency droop and electron distribution will both take an effect on the EQE and efficiency droop. Using appropriate indium composition in the InGaN barriers can not only improve the electron distribution, but increase the EQE with little <b>droop</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

This becomes even more crucial for the interior regions, which have no access to sea routes and have inadequate road and rail connectivity. In India there is uniform distribution of airports throughout the country but only a few of them are currently used because of poor infrastructure availability at these airports. Any aircraft operating from these airports, having minimal infrastructure, need to have efficient high-lift systems for short takeoff and landing ability as one of the key requirements. The purpose of this paper is look at the performance of a new high-lift airfoil configuration for application to a general transport aircraft. Design/methodology/approach – The present study deals with two-dimensional analyses of a high-lift system for general transport aircraft. The JUMBO 2 D, a multi-block structured viscous code has been used to make preliminary analysis of the proposed high-lift system. The configuration consists of three elements, namely, the main airfoil with nose droop, a vane and a flap.

40|$|In this study, {{with the}} NH 3 preflow, an AlN {{monolayer}} was initially formed {{on the surface}} of a sapphire substrate by the decomposition of the NH 3 source and Al 2 O 3 substrate.

At an injection current of 350 and 1500 mA, the light output powers of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with NH 3 preflow was increased by 2. 7 % and 12. 5 %, respectively. As the ambient temperature increased, the light output intensity decreased compared with room temperature, which could be attributed to the thermal-induced band-gap energy lowering and more thermally excited injection carriers escaping from the quantum wells without recombination. It also can be seen obviously that the hot/cold factors of LEDs with NH 3 preflow at different injection currents were better than those of the conventional LEDs.

30|$|The EQEs of LED I, LED II and LED III {{normalized}} to the LED I {{have also}} been calculated, {{as shown by the}} line curves in the Fig.  5. With the current density increasing, the normalized EQEs of LED II and LED III increase and saturate at fixed values of 1.07 and 0.41, respectively, which are just approximately equal to the square of the n ratios of LED II and LED III versus LED I, as calculated in the Fig.  4, indicating that the total effective electron concentration is the key factor, which can also effectively present the EQE of LEDs. As for LED II, it has the highest total effective electron concentration, which means the highest EQE. But at the same time, because of the less electron concentration accumulated in the individual quantum well, this will avoid the Auger recombination and minimize the droop effects at the high current density injection. For LED I, the total effective electron concentration is less than LED II, but because of that the electrons are mostly restricted in the first quantum well close to the n-type GaN layer, which can lead to a stronger Auger recombination and result in the <b>droop</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|Efficiency <b>droop</b> <b>effect</b> under high {{injection}} in GaN-based {{light emitting}} diodes (LEDs) strongly depends on wavelength, which is still not well understood. In this paper, through differential carrier lifetime measurements on commercialized near-UV, blue, and green LEDs, their different efficiency droop behaviors are attributed to different carrier lifetimes, which are prolonged as wavelength increases. This relationship between carrier lifetime and indium composition of InGaN quantum well is believed owing to the polarization-induced quantum confinement Stark effect. Long carrier lifetime not only increases the probability of carrier leakage, but also results in high carrier concentration in quantum well. In other words, under the same current density, the carrier concentration in active region in near-UV LED is the lowest while that in green one is the highest. If considering the efficiency droop depending on carrier concentration, the behaviors of LEDs with different wavelengths do not show any abnormality. The reason why the efficiency droop becomes more serious under lower temperature can be also explained by this model as well. Based on this result, the possible solutions to conquer efficiency droop are discussed. It seems that decreasing the carrier lifetime is a fundamental approach to solve the problem...|$|E

Due to the large inter-junction resistance of CNT film caused by mixture of metallic and semiconducting properties, the sheet resistance of CNT film is 200 to 1, 000 Ω/sq [9], which is relatively high compared with that of the ITO film.
