40|$|A {{functional}} lesion in corticotrophin (ACTH) -independent Cushing’s {{syndrome is}} difficult to distinguish from lesions of bilateral adrenal masses. Methods for distinguishing these lesions include adrenal venous sampling and 131 I- 6 β-iodomethyl- 19 -norcholesterol (131 I-NP- 59) scintigraphy. We present {{a case of a}} 29 -year-old Han Chinese female patient with a history of hypercholesterolaemia and polycystic ovary syndrome. She presented with a 6 month history of an 8 kg body weight gain and <b>gradual</b> <b>rounding</b> of the face. Serial examinations revealed loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol, elevated urinary free-cortisol level and undetectable ACTH level (< 5 pg/mL). No suppression was observed in both the low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Adrenal computed tomography revealed bilateral adrenal masses. Adrenal venous sampling was performed, and the right-to-left lateralisation ratio was 14. 29. The finding from adrenal scintigraphy with NP- 59 was consistent with right adrenal adenoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, and the pathology report showed adrenocortical adenoma. Her postoperative cortisol level was 3. 2 μg/dL, and her Cushingoid appearance improved. In sum, both adrenal venous sampling and 131 I-NP- 59 scintigraphy are good diagnostic methods for Cushing’s syndrome presenting with bilateral adrenal masses...|$|E

40|$|Campus Placements as we {{know today}} is a process {{involving}} interview of college students by recruiting companies utilizing institutional resources towards candidate job selection. The same campus placements which are being traditionally conducted {{by the arrival of}} HR Team to campus, their pre-placement talk about company and job description with the <b>gradual</b> interview <b>rounds</b> is slowly beginning to shift its perspectives towards a more greener stature. Especially now with the application of modern technology in hiring practices like E-Recruiting or On-line Recruitment, the entire campus recruitment process is also poised to leap towards a rapid change. Therefore, this research paper aims to construct an ideal strategy towards implementing campus placement process in parallel lines of E-Recruiting as well but with a more environment-friendly approach. This on-line campus placement process termed as 'Green Placements' will thrive as a conceptual model focused on to reduce resource wastages, save water, time, space, electricity by preserving the surrounding environment clean and green whilst the placement activity is being conducted at the college...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the parameterisation, implementation and eval-uation of floating-point adders and multipliers for FPGAs. We {{have developed a}} method, based on the Handel-C language, for producing technology-independent pipelined designs that allow compile-time parameterisation of design precision and range, and optional inclusion of features such as overflow protection, <b>gradual</b> underflow and <b>rounding</b> modes of the IEEE floating-point format. The resulting designs, when implemented in a Xilinx XCV 1000 device, achieve 28 MFLOPs with IEEE single precision floating-point numbers. These designs are used in an optimised implemen-tation for computing Two-Dimensional Fast Hartley Transform. Preliminary results suggest that our implementation is faster than many programmable DSP processors and supercomputers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{idiopathic}} external root resorption {{is a rare}} {{pathological condition}} usually detected as an incidental radiographic finding. External root resorption of permanent teeth is a multifactorial process related to several local and systemic factors. If an etiological factor cannot be identified for root resorption, the term "idiopathic" is applied. This report presents a case of multiple idiopathic apical root resorption. The condition {{was found in a}} young female patient seeking orthodontic treatment due to malocclusion. This kind of resorption starts apically and progresses coronally, causing a <b>gradual</b> shortening and <b>rounding</b> of the remaining root. Patients with this condition are not the ideal candidates for orthodontic treatment; however, the aim of this report is to describe an unusual case of idiopathic root resorption involving the entire dentition, and to present the orthodontic treatment of this patient. It describes the progress and completion of orthodontic therapy with satisfactory end results...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Spirillum lunatum {{has been}} shown to possess a life cycle in which there is an {{alternation}} between a vegetative and a microcyst stage. Microcyst formation may occur from the spiral vegetative cell by: (1) fusion of two entwined organisms to form one or more microcysts; (2) the production of a protuberance at some point along the organism into which the entire organism is gradually absorbed; (3) the <b>gradual</b> shortening and <b>rounding</b> of the organism to form an oval to spherical body. Microcyst formation begins, in a typical broth culture, at c. 24 hr. after inoculation and the majority of the organisms are in the microcyst stage after a 4 -day incubation period. When microcysts from an old culture are inoculated into fresh media, they germinate to form the spiral vegetative organism. Germination occurs by either unipolar or bipolar emergence of the germ tube. During a taxonomic study of the genus SpiriZZurn Ehrenberg (Williams, 1952), it was found that three species of the marine spirilla and two of the freshwater species exhibited morphological changes during the growth of the cultures. Young cultures, which consisted entirely of spiral organisms...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interlude}} entitled, Country Cunning and Unofficial Life, {{features an}} open letter from Cameron to Everett Richardson. The letter outlines Cameron's view of the fishermen's strike as a [...] "peasant's revolt." [...] It describes what Cameron sees as peasant characteristics including {{a code of ethics}} based on loyalty to one's own people and suspicion toward outsiders such as police, company managers and government bureaucrats. The letter points to self-sufficiency as another characteristic with peasants growing as much of their own food as they can, raising livestock, doing a little fishing and woodcutting supplemented by some [...] "outside labour" [...] such as delivering mail, working on the roads or driving the school bus. [...] "You built your own house," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "with lumber milled from the land you'd inherited from your grandfather. You went to church and respected the priest but you didn't take it all too seriously." [...] Cameron adds, however, that by 1970, the peasant way of life was disappearing with the advent of television, paved roads, consolidated schools, automatic oil furnaces, electric appliances and nine-to-five jobs all of which represented [...] "the <b>gradual</b> reduction of <b>rounded</b> human beings into workers and consumers." [...] Cameron argues that in 19th century England, exploited industrial workers fought for political reform and joined unions: ...|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen had {{not caught}} sight of Deronda in her passage, and while she was seated acquitting herself in chat with Sir Hugo, she glanced round her with careful ease, bowing a {{recognition}} here and there, and fearful lest an anxious-looking exploration in search of Deronda might be observed by her husband, and afterward rebuked as something [...] "damnably vulgar." [...] But all traveling, even that of a slow <b>gradual</b> glance <b>round</b> a room, brings a liability to undesired encounters, and amongst the eyes that met Gwendolen's, forcing her into a slight bow, were those of the [...] "amateur too fond of Meyerbeer," [...] Mr. Lush, whom Sir Hugo continued to find useful as a half-caste among gentlemen. He was standing near her husband, who, however, turned a shoulder toward him, and was being understood to listen to Lord Pentreath. How was it that at this moment, for the first time, there darted through Gwendolen, like a disagreeable sensation, {{the idea that this}} man knew all about her husband's life? He had been banished from her sight, according to her will, and she had been satisfied; he had sunk entirely into the background of her thoughts, screened away from her by the agitating figures that kept up an inward drama in which Lush had no place. Here suddenly he reappeared at her husband's elbow, and there sprang up in her, like an instantaneously fabricated memory in a dream, the sense of his being connected with the secrets that made her wretched. She was conscious of effort in turning her head away from him, trying to continue her wandering survey as if she had seen nothing of more consequence than the picture on the wall, till she discovered Deronda. But he was not looking toward her, and she withdrew her eyes from him, without having got any recognition, consoling herself with the assurance that he must have seen her come in. In fact, he was not standing far from the door with Hans Meyrick, whom he had been careful to bring into Lady Mallinger's list. They were both a little more anxious than was comfortable lest Mirah should not be heard to advantage. Deronda even felt himself on the brink of betraying emotion, Mirah's presence now being linked with crowding images of what had gone before and was to come after--all centering in the brother he was soon to reveal to her; and he had escaped as soon as he could from the side of Lady Pentreath, who had said in her violoncello voice-- ...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis {{occurs during}} {{embryogenesis}} {{and is a}} down-regulated process in the healthy adult that is almost exclusively linked to pathological conditions such as tumor growth, wound healing, and inflammation. Physiological angiogenic processes in the adult are restricted to the female reproductive system where they occur cyclically during the ovarian and uterine cycle as well as during pregnancy. By systematically analyzing the phenotypic changes of endothelial cells during bovine corpus luteum (CL) formation and regression, we have established a physiological model of blood vessel growth and regression. Quantitation of vessel density, percentage of vessels with lumen, and ratio of Bandeiraea simplicifolia-I to von Willebrand Factor-positive endothelial cells were established as parameters of angiogenesis. Sprouting endothelial cells invade the growing CL and continue to grow throughout the first third of the ovarian cycle. Thereafter the mature CL {{is characterized by a}} dense network of vessels with gradually decreasing vessel density. During luteolysis and for several weeks thereafter (regressing and residual CL) all newly formed vessels regress, which is accompanied by <b>gradual</b> foreshortening and <b>rounding</b> of endothelial cells and subsequent detachment. Based on histochemical detection of nucleosomal fragmentation products physiological blood vessel regression in the cyclic CL does not appear to involve endothelial cell apoptosis. Lectin histochemical analysis revealed a distinct alteration of endothelial cell glycoconjugate expression during ovarian angiogenesis comparable with the distinct pattern of hyperglycosylation of cultured migrating endothelial cells (up-regulation of binding sites for Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, wheat germ agglutinin, neuraminidase-treated peanut agglutinin, and Ricinus communis agglutinin-I on sprouting ECs). Northern blot analysis of glycosyltransferases during the different stages of angiogenesis revealed an up-regulation of beta-galactoside alpha 2, 6 -sialyltransferase and alpha 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase mRNA expression during the angiogenic stages of CL formation. These data establish the ovarian angiogenesis model as a suitable experimental system to study the functional and phenotypic properties of endothelial cells in sprouting and regressing blood vessels and provide additional evidence for the importance of endothelial cell surface glycoconjugates during angiogenesis...|$|R
