40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of gels containing the monoterpene borneol in induced oral mucositis using an animal model. Gels were prepared with borneol at 1. 2 % and 2. 4 % (w/w). Oral mucositis was induced by administration of three doses of 5 -fluorouracil (30 mg/kg, i. p.) and injury with acetic acid (50 %, v/v) soaked in filter paper applied to right cheek mucosa for 60 s. Four subgroups comprising 12 animals each were formed. Six animals from each group were sacrificed at days seven and fourteen after oral mucositis induction. Mucous samples were processed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s Trichrome. The semiquantitative evaluation involved observation of inflammatory parameters. ImageJ® software was used in the quantitative evaluation. For statistical analyses, Two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-test (p < 0. 05), were employed. Borneol 2. 4 % gel proved effective in the treatment of oral mucositis with statistically significant differences between groups for angiogenesis control, inflammatory cell count reduction and percentage neoformed collagen increase. The confirmation of anti-inflammatory and healing action of borneol in oral mucositis in rats renders it a good marker for predicting this activity <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> rich in this substance...|$|E

The VirD 2 protein, which is produced in Agrobacterium and is covalently attached to T-DNA, did not, under our assay conditions, ligate T-DNA to a model target sequence in vitro. We tested whether plant extracts could ligate T-DNA to target oligonucleotides in our test system. The in vitro ligation-integration reaction did indeed take place in the presence of plant extracts.

The high dose required and low density of these extracts make necessary a daily intake of several capsules, hindering adherence to the medication. The purpose of this work was to develop a suitable dosage form for the administration of Maytenus ilicifolia using effervescent granules. A 23 factorial design was used to study the physical characteristics of the granules (particle size distribution, repose angle, Carr index, scanning electron microscopy and disintegration time).
