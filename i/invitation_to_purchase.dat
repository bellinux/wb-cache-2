In August 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth Weaver announced the launch of Operation Avalanche, an operation to gather evidence against users of the Landslide gateway and payment system. The seized database records included 35,000 US subscribers, some of whom were targeted with <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> child pornography by mail. The Chicago Tribune reported that the government also continued to run the Reedys' Landslide website for a time as part of the sting.

5000|$|During {{the first}} semi-final, Ant & Dec {{announced}} that votes could be cast using the Britain's Got Talent mobile app. Votes {{had to be}} purchased in groups of three (costing £1.49) which then {{could be used to}} vote for any act when they appear on your device. If all three votes were not used in one show, they could be carried forward to the next. Once all three votes have been used, the voter would need to buy three more if they wish to place further votes. However, due to technical difficulties during the first semi-final, voting using the app was halted and, as a result, was not used {{for the rest of the}} series. ITV were reprimanded by Ofcom after thousands of viewers were unable to vote using this method. Due to this technical fault, over half of votes did not go through. While Ofcom acknowledged voting via smartphones was a new concept, it said it believed ITV was responsible for ensuring everything went smoothly: [...] "We were therefore concerned that the application was unable to handle demand when voting opened. [...] "This meant that a significant proportion of viewers who had responded to the programme's <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> voting credits via the app were unable to use them and that therefore viewers were effectively misled - albeit unintentionally. We expect licensees to take all steps and efforts that are reasonably practicable to ensure the integrity and robustness of the systems they use. However, we accept that technical problems can arise - particularly during live transmissions.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

5000|$|An <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat {{is not an}} offer, but an {{indication}} of a person's willingness to negotiate a contract. It's a pre-offer communication. In Harvey v. Facey, {{an indication}} by the owner of property {{that he or she}} might be interested in selling at a certain price, for example, has been regarded as an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat. Similarly in Gibson v Manchester City Council the words [...] "may be prepared to sell" [...] were held to be a notification of price and therefore not a distinct offer, though in another case concerning the same change of policy (Manchester City Council underwent a change of political control and stopped the sale of council houses to their tenants) Storer v. Manchester City Council, the court held that an agreement was completed by the tenant's signing and returning the agreement <b>to</b> <b>purchase,</b> as the language of the agreement had been sufficiently explicit and the signature on behalf of the council a mere formality to be completed. Statements of invitation are only intended to solicit offers from people and are not intended to result in any immediate binding obligation. The courts have tended to take a consistent approach to the identification of <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> treat, as compared with offer and acceptance, in common transactions. The display of goods for sale, whether in a shop window or on the shelves of a self-service store, is ordinarily treated as an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat and not an offer.|$|R

Later, in 1999, Houston wrote, [...] "It's hard to believe how naïve and presumptuous we were ... Four American college kids ... inviting the best British climbers on a major climb in the Himalayas". Houston was being self-effacing - the Americans were accomplished mountaineers and formed a very cohesive team.|$|R

50|$|True offers may be {{accepted}} {{to form a}} contract, whereas representations such as <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> treat may not. However, although an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat cannot {{be accepted}} {{it should not be}} ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For example, where an offer is made in response <b>to</b> an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the Boots case (described below) the offer is made by an action without any negotiations—such as presenting goods to a cashier—the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat.|$|R

50|$|Theo van Gogh had {{forwarded}} Octave Maus's <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> Gauguin when Gauguin {{was already}} in Arles. Around the same time Gauguin received news that a collector named Depuis had agreed <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> Breton Girls in a Ring (provided the artist made a minor modification), that two other of his canvasses had definitely sold, and — perhaps most significantly for Gauguin — that Edgar Degas intended to buy one of his paintings. Gauguin wrote to his friend Emile Schuffenecker with the good news of his invitation from Les XX. Shortly afterwards he received another invitation from Edouard Dujardin of La Revue Indépendante to exhibit in their rooms. Gauguin quickly rejected this <b>invitation</b> due <b>to</b> a review that {{had appeared in the}} Revue almost a year earlier; it had been written by Félix Fénéon, and the artist had been described as grièche.|$|R

In Alberta (Education) v Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), the Court further clarified this exemption from copyright law in the context of education, finding that a teacher may photocopy a brief excerpt from a textbook in circumstances where it would be impractical <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> a text book for each student.|$|R
