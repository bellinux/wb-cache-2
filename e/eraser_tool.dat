5000|$|<b>Eraser</b> <b>tool</b> allows {{objects to}} be erased or {{manipulated}} intuitively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eraser</b> <b>tool</b> erases content {{based on}} the active layer. If the user is on the text layer, then any text across which the tool is dragged will be erased. The eraser will convert the pixels to transparent, unless the {{background}} layer is selected. The size and style of the eraser can be selected in the options bar. This tool is unique in that it can {{take the form of}} the paintbrush and pencil tools. In addition to the straight <b>eraser</b> <b>tool,</b> there are two more available options - background eraser and magic eraser. The background eraser deletes any part of the image that is on the edge of an object. This tool is often used to extract objects from the background. The magic <b>eraser</b> <b>tool</b> deletes based on similar colored pixels. It is very similar to the magic wand tool. This tool is ideal for deleting areas with the same color or tone that contrasts {{with the rest of the}} image.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{only one}} <b>eraser</b> <b>tool</b> and {{paintings}} cannot be saved into memory or printed on a printer. Only 16 colors {{can be used on}} canvases that feature the film's characters; the full 256-color spectrum is reserved for the blank canvas. While the blank canvas allows for total creativity for older children, the [...] "character canvases" [...] are good for teaching hand-to-eye coordination with very young children. During the interactive adventure, the Queen of Hearts divides a magic globe into three different colored miniature globes. As a result, all the color in Wonderland turns into monochrome and Alice must find the globes in order to restore color to Wonderland.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most popular}} {{graphics}} editing and composition tools, Tux Paint includes a paintbrush, an <b>eraser,</b> and <b>tools</b> to draw lines, polygonal shapes and text. Tux Paint provides multiple levels of undo and redo, allowing accidental or unwanted changes {{to be removed}} while editing a picture.|$|R
5000|$|New tools {{included}} new brushes (and a new brush file format), grayscale and RGB transparency,"Bucket fill" [...] {{patterns and}} a pattern selection dialog, integrated paint modes, border, feather and color selectors, {{a pencil and}} <b>eraser</b> paint <b>tool,</b> gamma adjustments and a limited layer move tool.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} tools {{that can be}} used for editing images in GIMP. The more common tools include a paint brush, pencil, airbrush, <b>eraser</b> and ink <b>tools</b> used to create new or blended pixels. The Bucket Fill tool can be used to fill a {{selection}} with a color or pattern. The Blend tool can be used to fill a selection with a color gradient. These color transitions can be applied to large regions or smaller custom path selections.|$|R
5000|$|It {{includes}} a simple brush-based freehand drawing tool, an <b>eraser</b> <b>tool,</b> a select tool, a freehand spray can tool which applies several pixels onto an area {{instead of just}} one, a fill tool, a [...] "bomb" [...] tool that clears the page, a line tool, a curve tool, square, circle/oval, and rounded square tools, text tool, a color picker/eyedropper, and a zoom in/zoom out tool. Zooming in will go up to 1600%, while zooming out will only go up to 25%. There are adjustable stroke sizes which pertain to the brush, eraser, and spray can tools. Stroke size 1 has a width of 1 pixel, and stroke size 10 has a width of 19 pixels. The text tool allows users to select from their computer's font menu. Also, colors can be selected from a palette.|$|E
50|$|Windows Defender (Beta 2) was {{released}} on February 13, 2006. It featured the program's new name and a significant user interface redesign. The core engine was rewritten in C++, unlike the original GIANT-developed one, which was written in Visual Basic. This improved the application's performance. Also, since beta 2, the program works as a Windows service, unlike earlier releases, which enables the application to protect the computer even when a user is not logged on. Beta 2 also requires Windows Genuine Advantage validation. However, Windows Defender (Beta 2) did not contain some of the tools found in Microsoft AntiSpyware (Beta 1); Microsoft removed the System Inoculation, Secure Shredder and System Explorer tools found in MSAS (Beta 1) {{as well as the}} Tracks <b>Eraser</b> <b>tool,</b> which allowed users to easily delete many different types of temporary files related to Internet Explorer 6, including HTTP cookies, web cache, and Windows Media Player playback history. Microsoft later released German and Japanese versions of Windows Defender (Beta 2).|$|E

50|$|Mail art {{has adopted}} and {{appropriated}} several of graphic forms already {{associated with the}} postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by Dada and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into <b>erasers</b> with linocut <b>tools</b> to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing {{the identity of the}} sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes {{an important part of the}} mail art experience.|$|R
50|$|Fatpaint has {{full support}} for Pen Tablets and users can pick pen, brush, airbrush, paint bucket, clone painting, <b>eraser</b> and smudging <b>tools.</b> Fatpaint offers 8 {{palettes}} for painting, plus 13 palettes when clone painting. Fatpaint {{allows users to}} import or create their own brushes and thousands of free clipart drawings and brush sets that have dynamic brushes, effects and blend modes. Paintings can be combined in different layers and objects. Similarly, paintings can be cropped, resized, skewed, bent, distorted and rotated in 2D and 3D. Moreover, the graphics can be displayed on custom printed products which users can buy or sell for personal or business uses.|$|R
50|$|Pixen {{features}} an interface {{similar to that}} of Adobe Photoshop. While common tools such as the pencil, <b>eraser</b> and fill <b>tool</b> are included, Pixen also uses a unique left/right tool system. This system enables the user to assign a different tool to the left and right mouse buttons. This can be used effectively when drawing and erasing. Pixen also {{features an}} extensive color palette system and, like many other bitmap-based editors, supports editing images by layers; users can organize parts of an image, name them and hide them. Anti-aliasing is not possible to achieve in Pixen due to its focus on pixel art creation.|$|R
40|$|D shape {{acquisition}} {{has become}} a major tool for creating digital 3 D surface data in a variety of application fields. Despite the steady increase in accuracy, most available scanning techniques cause severe scanning artifacts such as noise, outliers, holes, or ghost geometry. To apply sophisticated modeling operations on these data sets, substantial post-processing is usually required. In this paper, we address a variety of scanning artifacts that are created by common optical scanners and provide a comprehensive set of user-guided tools to process corrupted data sets. These include an <b>eraser</b> <b>tool,</b> low-pass filters for noise removal, a set of outlier detection methods, and various up-sampling and hole-filling tools. These techniques can be applied early in the content creation pipeline...|$|E
30|$|The {{choice of}} the method {{allowing}} to select the ray cast length {{is certainly one of}} the most important in our context, where duration should be reduced as much as possible. We originally decided to let the user click and draw the frontier, as it is the case in most of standard software. However, we quickly notice that the user often has to redo his drawing when he loses his mental focus, even if almost all the drawing is perfect. Obviously, an <b>eraser</b> <b>tool</b> could allow to correct the mistaken area, but this action also takes time. The first big advantage of our approach is that it allows correcting extremely quickly the area where a mistake occurs only. The second advantage comes from the idea of using a keyboard control to validate the ray length instead of using the mouse left button. Indeed, it removes the hand tremor when the user clicks on the mouse and maintains pushed the left button. We observed that all users needed two to three less time to validate the diaphragm frontier with our interface.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for aneurysm volume quantification on three-dimensional angiograms, which focuses on solving three common technical problems: the variability {{associated with the use}} of manual thresholds, the irregular morphology of some aneurysms, and the imprecision of the limits between the parent artery and the aneurysm sac. The method consists of combining an algorithm for automatic threshold determination with a spherical <b>eraser</b> <b>tool</b> that allows the user to separate the image of the aneurysm from the parent artery. The accuracy of volumetry after automatic thresholding was verified with an in vitro experiment in which 57 measurements were performed using four artificial aneurysms of known volume. The reliability of the method was compared to that obtained with the technique of ellipsoid approximation in a clinical setting of 15 real angiograms and 150 measurements performed by five different users. The mean error in the measurement of the artificial aneurysms was 7. 23 %. The reliability of the new approach was significantly higher than that of the ellipsoid approximation. Limits of agreement between two measurements were determined with Bland-Altman plots and ranged from − 14 to 13 % for complex and from − 10. 8 to 11. 03 % for simple-shaped sacs. The reproducibility was lower (> 20 % of variation) for small aneurysms (< 70 mm 3) and for those presenting a very wide neck (dome-to-neck ratio < 1). The method is potentially useful in the clinical practice, since it provides relatively precise, reproducible, volume quantification. A safety coiling volume can be established in order to perform sufficient but not excessive filling of the aneurysm pouch...|$|E
40|$|Part 6 : FORENSIC TOOLSInternational audienceThe {{validation}} of forensic tools {{is an important}} requirement in digital forensics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has defined standards for many digital forensic tools. However, a standard {{has not yet been}} specified for secure wiping tools. This chapter defines secure wiping functionality criteria for NTFS specific to Windows 7 and magnetic hard drives. The criteria were created based on the remnants of user actions – file creation, modification and deletion – in $MFT records, the $LogFile and the hard disk. Of particular relevance {{is the fact that the}} $LogFile, which holds considerable forensic artifacts of user actions, is not wiped properly by many tools. The use of the proposed functionality criteria is demonstrated in an evaluation of the <b>Eraser</b> secure wiping <b>tool...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{models of}} SMART Board include a pen tray {{on the front}} of the {{interactive}} whiteboard that holds two to four plastic pen tools and SOMETIMES an <b>eraser.</b> The pen <b>tools</b> have neither electronic components nor ink - the technology is in the pen tray. When a pen tool is removed from its slot in the tray, a sensor recognizes its absence. In older models this was an optical sensor but newer, self-contained flat-panel models use a magnetic sensor which also works to keep the pen attached to the board when not in use. The Smart Board software processes the next contact with the interactive whiteboard surface as a pen action from the pen tool that resides in the corresponding slot. Older models of the Smart Board interactive whiteboard features slots for black, blue, red and green pen tools, although a control panel can be used to change the color of the digital ink or change the pen tools to colored highlighters.|$|R
40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{describes a}} draft {{version of a}} tool that has been developed within ERASER Work Package 3 (Road authorities pilot) to help European road authorities make decisions to improve the safety and ‘self-explainingness’ of their roads. For this tool, the concept of self-explaining roads (SER) has been taken forward in relation to speed: {{the design of a}} road can provide explicit cues to road users about what the speed limit might be, and may also implicitly and intuitively evoke a sense of appropriate speed. It is suggested that various characteristics of a road may act as accelerators or decelerators, giving road users the impression of a faster or slower road; a self-explaining road will have characteristics that are in line with the speed limit on the road and the speed limit will therefore be credible. The aim of the tool is not just to make roads and their speed limits more credible or self explaining, but also to ensure that speed limits are safe. The tool is grounded in the ‘safe system’ approach. In Sweden and the Netherlands, where the safe system approach has already been embraced, ‘safe’ speeds have been defined in order to improve the ‘system’ such that crashes are survivable. The tool that has been developed requires that road characteristic data are entered and, on this basis, the tool calculates what would be a ‘safe speed’ (i. e. survivable) and assesses whether the speed limit is credible. This deliverable describes the variables {{that could be used in}} a tool for self-explanatory and safe roads, and details the basis upon which a safe speed and credible speed assessment can be made. For this project, the <b>ERASER</b> <b>tool</b> has been developed to be used on rural roads, since these roads have been the focus of the ERA-Net programme. Care was also taken to develop a tool that did not require intensive data collection (in recognition that not all road authorities are ready for GIS-based tools that require significant data). As such the data required is relatively light and this version works on a road-by-road basis rather than across a whole network. In order to gain feedback on the direction of the development of the tool, a functionality and usability check was undertaken to better understand how the tool might be used by road authorities, what functionality should be included and whether the tool was useable. The functionality and usability check found that most authorities were content with the basis and style of the tool. Suggestions were made for changes, however, most of these suggestions were in the direction of more detail and more fine-tuning, which might be taken into account in a next version of the tool. The road authority representatives did not always agree in their comments: some road authorities plead for more detail in order to be more precise, others were more in favour of less detailed options. This may highlight the need for future work to be tailored to the needs of specific road authorities and in accordance with data availability. It may be feasible in the future to progress two different tools — one that has relatively light data requirements, and one that requires more detail, but can provide more accurate outputs. Based on the comments of the road authorities, the <b>ERASER</b> <b>tool</b> has been improved by improving the precision of data requirements and improving the indication of categories within the data-input where needed. Other suggestions that were made — for instance the wish to include more speed comparisons and a network-wide approach - might be taken into account if a more extended version of the tool will be developed.

40|$|Authors: Geoffrey Norris, Noel Derecki & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract This is an {{effective}} tool to measure the process complexity of microglia in order to detect subtle changes in microglia morphology. Confocal Z-projections using a single antibody on fixed tissue {{can be used to}} detail microglia profiles in comparison to various conditions including brain region, disease models, and aging. ### Introduction This profiling technique can be used to compare microglial morphology in response to injury, age, genetic background, or for regional comparisons. Sholl profiles detailing process length, complexity, and soma size may be obtained by following this procedure. ### Materials 1. 4 % PFA fixed floating brain sections - 0. 5 % Triton in PBS - PBS (0. 1 M) - Normal chicken serum (Vector Labs) - Bovine serum albumin - Aquamount - Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Mouse Iba 1 antibody (Biocare Medical) - Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken anti-Rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) - DAPI nuclear stain (Sigma) ### Equipment 1. Confocal microscope (Leica SP 8 used in all of our studies) - FIJI software (Variant of ImageJ) ### Procedure 1. Sacrifice an animal with an i. p. injection of a lethal dose of ketamine. - Transcardially perfuse the mouse on a low speed (~ 3 minutes) with 15 mL of ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS containing 5 U/mL heparin. (the right atrium is clipped with scissors shortly after perfusion to ensure effective clearing of the brain). - Next infuse 25 mL of ice cold 4 % PFA. - Remove the brain and store in 4 % PFA at 4 degrees C for 72 hours of post-fixation with gentle rocking in 20 mL scintillation vials. - Remove excess PFA by dabbing the brain on a kimwipe and then transfer to a scintillation vial containing a 30 % sucrose solution at 4 degrees. - Once the brain has fully sunk (~ 2 days) the brain can be snap frozen in isopentane on dry ice or mounted immediately for freezing on chucks for slicing. - Mount the brain on a cryostat chuck using the cut bulb of a transfer pipette and OCT. - Place the empty cylinder of the transfer pipette bulb on to the chuck pre-stored in the cryostat Quick Freeze bar. - Place a layer of OCT on the chuck and orient the frozen or fresh brain flush with the bulb for coronal sectioning. - Place 40 um coronal sections in 0. 1 % sodium azide in PBS for storage at 4 degrees C. - Briefly wash slices in PBS to remove sodium azide. - Wash in 0. 5 % PBST (Triton X- 100) for 15 minutes at room temperature for permeabilization. - Wash in two rinses of PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. - Block for 2 hours at room temperature in 5 % normal chicken serum. - Incubate in primary antibody (Biocare Medical polyclonal rabbit-anti mouse Iba 1) at 1 : 300 in 0. 5 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 degrees C. - Wash 3 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature - Place in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken Anti-Rabbit IgG) diluted 1 : 800 in 5 % normal chicken serum in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. - Wash for 5 minutes in DAPI diluted 1 : 20, 000 in PBS at room temperature. - Wash 2 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature. - Mount on slides using Aquamount and let dry in the dark at room temperature for at least four hours. - Using the 63 x objective on the confocal microscope, utilize the UV wide-field laser and DAPI fluorescence to select three fields from a given slice to represent that brain region. Three fields from each slice with three slices per mouse with at least three mice per experimental condition should be used to ensure a representative sampling of microglia (n > 30 microglia). - Once the focus is set on the eyepieces, switch to the optimal laser for Iba 1 fluorescence and range the z-stack on the microscope so that an entire microglia is located within the z-stack (~ 30 um per stack). - While imaging preferences should be determined by each user, our lab prefers to use HyD detectors in counting mode on the SP 8 Leica confocal microscope. This combined with a 3 -frame average provides the best resolution for obtaining clear Z-stacks. - Capture each Z-stack at a minimum resolution of 512 × 512, and enable your stack to make one slice per micron. - Load images on to FIJI using the drag and drop method. - Prepare a maximum intensity Z-stack projection - Make the image binary by thresholding to include microglial processes. - Isolate a single microglia by removing surrounding processes with the <b>eraser</b> <b>tool.</b> - Using the line segment tool, draw a single line {{from the center of the}} microglia soma to its longest process. - Using the Sholl analysis plugin, define the first shell to be 10 um outside of the cell body (to exclude the soma from Sholl analysis) and set each step to be 5 um. Select linear profile to conclude the analysis. - Copy the Sholl profile and enter in to Excel. Two complete microglia per field should be used for analysis. Avoid incomplete microglia or those with processes on the margin of the field. - Processes can then be erased and the microglia soma size recorded. - Once profiles are compiled for each mouse, total profiles for each experimental condition are pooled and imported in to statistical software. A two-way ANOVA should then be performed with the number of intersections from soma center and experimental variable used as the factors. ### Timing - Tissue Collection- ~ 2 hrs - Tissue Fixation and Cryoprotection- ~ 4 days - Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry – user defined - Imaging and quantification- (~ 1 day for a cohort of 6 mice) ### Anticipated Results Properly prepared tissue and a quality microscope should ensure excellent and reproducible microglial imaging with regards to the Iba 1 antibody. CX 3 CR 1 -GFP mice may also be imaged for Sholl Profiling in a similar way. ### References 1. Morrison, H. W., and Filosa, J. A.
