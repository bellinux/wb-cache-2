40|$|A new {{experiment}} method called hole filling {{method was}} proposed {{to simulate the}} <b>internal</b> <b>cracks</b> inside rolled pieces. The healing behavior of <b>internal</b> <b>cracks</b> in a mild steel plate during rolling was studied by presetting <b>internal</b> <b>cracks</b> in a sample.

40|$|The damage {{mechanism}} of {{two types of}} ductile cast iron have been studied by precise microscopical observations and careful chemical, morphological and mechanical characterizations. Two modes of damage are observed {{as a function of}} graphite morphology : the void growth at the pole of the graphite or the void growth by <b>internal</b> <b>cracking.</b> These two types of damage are considered by micro mechanical method. The plastic deformation of the matrix is taken into account and the damage processes are modeled : replacing the nodule by a void or anisotropic inclusion for void growth at interface case, introducing two population of inclusions (nodule and penny-shape <b>crack)</b> for <b>internal</b> <b>cracking</b> case. These results show that graphite nodules in cast iron serve essentially as void nucleation sites and that as soon as debonding occurs, the nodules can be replaced by voids (cast iron A). The predicted local of flow stress in the case of <b>internal</b> <b>cracking</b> is higher than {{in the case of the}} voids one.

The initiation site was a facet or its aggregate which originated from α grain transgranular cracking in each material. In equiaxed α structures, the location of initiation site was obviously restricted to near the specimen surface (i. e. 10 - 200 μm deep from the specimen surface). In acicular α structures, the location {{was more or less}} near the specimen surface and more interior cases were also seen, which were associated with a larger initiation site size.

40|$|This paper aims {{to further}} the {{understanding}} of the interaction between reinforcement in tension and the surrounding cracked concrete. This is achieved using the elastic analysis of axisymmetric prisms reinforced with a single central bar.

This preliminary analysis confirms that the elastic analysis adopted in this investigation is reasonable. Two analytical exercises are described: the first assumes no slip, plasticity, or <b>internal</b> <b>cracking</b> at the interface between the steel and the concrete; the second introduces <b>internal</b> <b>cracking</b> and debonding between ribs. The first analysis indicates that shear deformation of the surrounding concrete accounts for a substantial proportion of the surface crack width, and therefore that this form of deformation cannot be ignored in crack prediction formulae.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{features of}} fatigue crack initiation and growth in aeronautical VT 3 - 1 titanium alloy under pure torsion loading in gigacycle regime. Two materials: extruded and forged VT 3 - 1 titanium alloys were studied. Torsion fatigue tests were performed up to fatigue life of 109 cycles. The {{results of the}} torsion tests were compared with previously obtained results under fully reversed axial loading on the same alloys. It {{has been shown that}} independently on production process as surface as well subsurface crack initiation may appear under ultrasonic torsion loading despite the maximum stress amplitude located at the specimen surface. In the case of surface crack initiation, a scenario of crack initiation and growth is similar to HCF regime except an additional possibility for <b>internal</b> <b>crack</b> branching. In the case of subsurface crack, the initiation site is located below the specimen surface (about 200 μm) and is not clearly related to any material flaw. <b>Internal</b> <b>crack</b> initiation is produced by shear stress in maximum shear plane and early crack growth is in Mode II.
