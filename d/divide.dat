5|$|Further north {{along the}} Continental <b>Divide,</b> a short portion of the {{combined}} Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie-Slave-Athabasca watershed, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a <b>divide</b> between streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean {{and those of the}} Hudson Bay watershed. This <b>divide</b> meets the Continental <b>Divide</b> at Snow Dome (also known as Dome), near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental <b>Divide</b> separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental <b>Divide</b> separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian <b>Divide,</b> which meets the Continental <b>Divide</b> at Triple <b>Divide</b> Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Continental <b>Divide</b> of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The <b>divide</b> is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the <b>divide.</b> The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the <b>divide.</b> As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} notion of weak <b>dividing</b> {{introduced}} by S. Shelah. In particular we prove that T is stable iff weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric. In order to study simple theories Shelah originally defined weak <b>dividing</b> in [6]. This notion is overshadowed by that of <b>dividing,</b> as the first author proved that <b>dividing</b> is the right well-behaved notion for simple theories [2],[3],[5],and [4]. However Dolich’s paper[1] reminded us that weak <b>dividing</b> is still an interesting notion. There he noted that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric and transitive in stable theories, and that simplicity {{is characterized by the}} property that <b>dividing</b> implies weak <b>dividing.</b> Here we continue the investigation of {{the notion of}} weak <b>dividing.</b> Intriguingly, what weak <b>dividing</b> is to stability is analogous with what <b>dividing</b> is to simplicity. For example, we show that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric only in stable theories (2. 5). Stability is also equivalent to left local character of weak <b>dividing.</b> However for the transitivity of weak <b>dividing,</b> a similar analogy does not exist. Namely, in a non-stable simple theory (e. g. the theory of the random graph), weak <b>dividing</b> can be transitive (2. 7). As usual, we work in a saturated model of an arbitrary complete theory T.

5|$|Mitochondria <b>divide</b> by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may <b>divide</b> synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and <b>divide</b> mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and <b>divide.</b> When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
