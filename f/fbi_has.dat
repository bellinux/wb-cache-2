5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the X-Files, the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> reassigned Mulder to a {{low-level}} wiretap while his former partner, Dana Scully, has returned to teaching at the FBI Academy. The two have a discreet meeting at {{the parking lot of the}} Watergate Hotel, where Mulder admits that he has been doubting his belief in the paranormal since Deep Throat's assassination. Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, Samantha, was abducted.|$|E
5|$|The College of Law {{is ranked}} 92nd nationally by U.S. News & World Report. It is an {{emerging}} {{leader in the}} relatively novel field of National Security Law. In 2007 the Law School started the Cold Case Justice Initiative, investigating cold cases from {{the civil rights era}} in the South. Its professors and students have identified 196 cases, of which more than 100 are in Georgia, and will give information to the US Department of Justice in order to have cases prosecuted. The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> identified 122 cold cases that it is trying to resolve.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E

25|$|The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} for its {{handling}} of Boston organized crime figure Whitey Bulger. Beginning in 1975, Bulger served as an informant for the FBI. As a result, the Bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange {{for information about the}} inner workings of the Italian American Patriarca crime family.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of the {{provision}} {{point out that}} these records are held by third parties, and therefore are exempt from a citizen's reasonable expectations of privacy and also maintain that the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> not abused {{the provision}}. As proof, then Attorney General John Ashcroft released information in 2003 that showed that section 215 orders had never been used.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{started to}} conduct an {{independent}} investigation in Lopez's death. Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas announced in a statement on October 25 that he will cooperate fully with federal investigators.

50|$|Wolfe instead {{decides that}} it would serve his {{purposes}} better {{to prove that the}} <b>FBI</b> <b>had</b> no part in the murder. He also devises a plan to trap the FBI. Acting on the suspicion that the <b>FBI</b> <b>have</b> secretly bugged Wolfe’s office, Wolfe gathers the key suspects in his office and publicly claims that he is gathering proof that FBI agents murdered Althaus and are covering it up, while directing Archie to conduct his own investigation.|$|R
25|$|On February 18, 2016, the FBI {{revealed}} {{that they have}} not ruled out the possibility of a third shooter, but clarified that they are continuing to operate under the assumption that only two shooters were involved. Some witnesses who claimed to have seen three gunmen at the Inland Regional Center continued to assert their accounts. As of December 1, 2016, it was reported that the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> yet to rule out that possibility.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old Chechen {{native and}} former mixed martial arts fighter who knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev, {{was shot and}} killed in Orlando, Florida, by law {{enforcement}} officers who had been interviewing him about the Waltham murders as well as the Boston Marathon bombings. The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> alleged that just before he was killed, Todashev made statements implicating both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the Waltham murders – saying that the initial crime was a drug robbery, and the murders were committed to prevent being identified by the victims.|$|E
25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers {{as they come}} to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.|$|E
5000|$|The media {{reported}} in 2007 {{that a government}} audit found the <b>FBI</b> <b>had</b> violated the rules more than 1,000 times in an audit of 10% of its national investigations between 2002 and 2007. Twenty such incidents involved requests by agents for information not permitted under the law [...] A subsequent report in 2014 by the Justice Department Office of Inspector General Report concluded the <b>FBI</b> <b>had</b> corrected its practices and that NSLs complied with the federal statutes.|$|R

The files were collected for various reasons. Some {{of the subjects}} were investigated for alleged ties to the Communist party (Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx), or in connection with antiwar activities during the Vietnam War (John Denver, John Lennon, and Jane Fonda). Numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them (Sonny Bono, John Denver, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra).|$|E
25|$|It was {{his paper}} on the Eppes Convergence, which {{concerned}} asymptotics of Hermitian random matrices, {{that made him a}} star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> prevented him from doing research significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on cognitive emergence theory ("the mathematics of the brain") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although he was a child prodigy, Charlie now laments the fact that his best years in his research will never come ahead of schedule again.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 The Observer {{described}} {{what it called}} a network of relationships between apparently unconnected animal rights groups {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, writing that, with assets of $6.5 million, and with the PETA Foundation holding further assets of $15 million, PETA funds a number of activists and groups—some with links to militant groups, including the ALF, which the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> named as a domestic terrorist threat. American writer Don Liddick writes that PETA gave $1,500 to the Earth Liberation Front in 2001—Newkirk said the donation was a mistake, and that the money had been intended for public education about destruction of habitat, but Liddick writes that it went to the legal defense of Craig Rosebraugh, an ELF spokesman. That same year, according to The Observer, PETA gave a $5,000 grant to American animal rights activist Josh Harper, an advocate of arson.|$|E

25|$|On July 7, the State Department reopened its {{probe into}} the email controversy. On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} Congress that the <b>FBI</b> <b>had</b> started looking into newly discovered emails {{that may be}} pertinent to the case. Law enforcement officials stated the emails were found on a laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin's husband, Anthony Weiner, during an investigation of his sexting scandals. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the <b>FBI</b> <b>had</b> not changed its conclusion, reached in July, regarding Clinton's emails.|$|R
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} proposed include FBI incompetence, that Syria or Iraq {{directed the}} attacks, or that similar to some 9/11 conspiracy theories the U.S. government knew {{in advance that}} the attacks would occur. Senator Patrick Leahy who is Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and who had received an anthrax-tainted letter, said the <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> not produced convincing evidence in the case. The Washington Post called for an independent investigation in the case saying that reporters and scientists were poking holes in the case. Had both attacks on the senators succeeded in killing their targets, the result {{would have been a}} Republican majority in the Senate, in the immediate future because of the loss of two Democrats, and in the long term, as the governors of the targets' states would have been likely to name Republican replacements. This suggests that right-wing extremists had an incentive to carry out the attacks.|$|E
25|$|A triple {{homicide}} {{was committed}} in Waltham, Massachusetts, {{on the evening}} of September 11, 2011. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the case was reexamined, and authorities said the Tsarnaev brothers may have been responsible for the murders, that forensic evidence connected them {{to the scene of the}} killings, and that their cell phone records placed them in the area at the time of the killings. In May 2013, Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old Chechen native and former mixed martial arts fighter who knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was shot and killed in Orlando, Florida, by law enforcement officers who had been interviewing him about the Waltham murders as well as the bombings.

25|$|The <b>FBI</b> <b>has</b> been {{frequently}} {{depicted in}} popular media since the 1930s. The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct {{involvement in the}} creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases. A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the 1993–2002 series The X-Files, which concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional Special Agents, and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agency in the TV drama 24, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division. The 1991 movie Point Break {{is based on the}} true story of an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers. The 1997 movie Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia. The 2015 TV series Quantico, titled after the location of the Bureau's training facility, deals with Probationary and Special Agents, not all of whom, within the show's format, may be fully reliable or even trustworthy.|$|E
