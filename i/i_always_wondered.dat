2500|$|In August 2008, Thile and bassist Edgar Meyer {{announced}} the release {{date of the}} duo's planned debut album. The album was released on Thile's label Nonesuch Records on September 23, 2008. Commenting on the collaboration, Thile said [...] "Edgar {{is one of the}} biggest influences on my musical life, and now I'm in a duo with him and writing songs with him. This was my dream. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> what it would be like to be playing music this hard." [...] The duo toured in September and October 2008 to promote the album.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't say I'm sorry!" [...] she said, {{laughing}} again. [...] "But I am {{very glad}} to have seen you. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> about you. You are a curiosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The chap {{that had}} the waistcoat, and went away {{in the morning to}} California. Fancy {{starting}} to California after a hard night. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> whether he got there alive.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Emily, [...] "I {{do think}} that bringin' up {{children}} is the most awful responsibility, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> when <b>I</b> hear that any one dares to undertake it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet I am glad. I am so glad {{there is}} always you beyond my scope, Something that stands over, Something I shall never be, That <b>I</b> shall <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> over, and wait for, Look for like the breath of life as long as I live, Still waiting for you, however old you are, and I [...] am, <b>I</b> shall <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> over you, and look for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! there's Priggles, the publisher. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> about printers' overs. Priggles was {{a clever}} man ... But we shall know now--even about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I get you," [...] rejoined Blair. [...] "That isn't the point, though. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> if we'd {{find our}} old jobs open to us. Of course, I couldn't fill mine now. It was an outside job--lots of walking." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> {{on these}} {{occasions}} whether he {{ever thought of}} Mrs. Skimpole and the children, and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind. So far as I could understand, they rarely presented themselves at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{nearly twenty}} years," [...] she said, [...] "you disappeared. You were {{reported}} {{at different times}} to be in every quarter of the earth, from Zambesia to Pekin. But no one knew, and, of course, in a season or two you were forgotten. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered,</b> I am wondering now, where were you? What {{did you do with}} yourself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the best}} place," [...] Ricker commented. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> at in {{you is the}} rapidity with which you Ve taken on the city. You were quite in the green wood when you came here, and now you know your Boston like a little man. I suppose it's your {{newspaper}} work that's familiarized you with the place. Well, {{how do you like}} your friend Witherby, as far as you've gone?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rice-Oxley {{explains}} his thoughts about [...] "Try Again" [...] {{on the fifth}} Keane podcast: [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> think about it as being a commuter's love song. There's something weird about that feeling of being on a train really really late at night when there's {{just a handful of}} you there, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> what everyone's story is - especially people who've been to work and probably got up at some horrendous hour of the morning, and they're traipsing back to their home somewhere in the suburbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps you'd better start, in {{case she}} reckernizes my voice," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Pitch it in strong about me and 'ow <b>I</b> was <b>always</b> <b>wondering</b> what had 'appened to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nary a potato," [...] Shorty {{told the}} whining, begging Wentworth. [...] "You ain't even touched with scurvy. You got outside a whole sack, an' you're loaded against scurvy for twenty years. Knowin' you, I've come to {{understand}} God. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> why he let Satan live. Now I know. He let him live just as I let you live. But it's a cryin' shame, just the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellently; I like {{pride of}} your sort; impetuosity becomes you, for {{you have learned}} to control it if need be; and the {{ambition}} is best of all. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> at your want of it, and longed to stir you up; for you did not seem {{the sort of man}} to be contented with mere creature comforts when there are so many fine things men may do. What shall you choose, Davy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ough!" [...] Massy shuddered. [...] "You make {{my blood}} run cold. What made you come here? What made you come aboard that evening {{all of a}} sudden, with your high talk and your money--tempting me? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> what was your motive? You {{fastened}} yourself on me to have easy times and grow fat on my life blood, I tell you. Was that it? I believe you are the greatest miser in the world, or else why [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I came pretty near an {{undervaluation}} in that Lindau trouble. <b>I</b> shall <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> what put a backbone into Fulkerson {{just at that}} crisis. Fulkerson doesn't {{strike me}} as the stuff of a moral hero." ...|$|R
6000|$|That was a two-edged thrust, for Trix {{was decidedly}} an old girl, and Tom was {{generally}} regarded as a hapless victim. Trix turned red; {{but before she could}} load and fire again, Emma Davenport, who labored under the delusion that this sort of skirmishing was ill-natured, and therefore ill-bred, spoke up in her pleasant way, [...] "Speaking of pitying the poor, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> why it is that we all like to read and cry over their troubles in books, but when we have the real thing before us, we think it is uninteresting and disagreeable." ...|$|R
5000|$|This book {{contains}} much of Carlin's {{stand-up comedy}} material. The title derives {{from one of}} the observations in the book: Carlin finds it interesting that the same race can invent something as fun and innocent as Silly Putty and something as deadly as napalm — the two have many similar properties. The title is also an allusion to the type of thoughts that occupy his time, saying, [...] "on one hand I kinda like it when a lot of people die, but on the other hand, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> how many unused frequent-flyer miles they had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "''N' {{after all}} the lights are out [...] I'm sorry 'bout it; so I creep [...] Out of my trundle bed to ma's [...] 'N' say I love her a whole heap, [...] 'N' kiss her, 'n' I hug her tight.

6000|$|... "'Pa lays around 'n' loafs all day, [...] 'N' reads {{and makes}} us leave him be.

6000|$|... "How anxious {{you must}} be," [...] she murmured. [...] "Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Isobel would not some day weary of your milk-and-water Bohemianism. Your Scotch friend is worthy, no doubt, but dull, {{and the boy}} was too hopelessly in love to be amusing. And as for you--well--you would do very nicely, no doubt, my dear Arnold, but you are too stuffed up with {{principles}} for a girl of Isobel's antecedents. So she has cut the Gordian knot herself! Well, I am sorry!" ...|$|E
5000|$|She was honoured as {{an officer}} of the Legion d'honneur in 1958, and as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1967. Many people {{regarded}} her as eccentric. An article in Time magazine portrayed her as [...] "a brilliant Rimbaud scholar who pub-crawls about Oxford in bright red slacks and beret while smoking cigars." [...] Francis Steegmuller wrote, [...] "One of the things I most enjoyed about her was her true eccentricity, in a world where false eccentricity has become a kind of conformity. My wife is the novelist, Shirley Hazzard, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> when Enid will appear in one of her books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'My dear Mac,' said he, laying {{his hand}} upon my shoulder, 'there {{is only one}} good thing about me, {{and that is a}} moral. Man is as God made him: don't be so sure that you can take him to pieces and improve him. All my life I have sought to make myself an unnaturally {{superior}} person. Nature has retaliated by making me also an unnaturally inferior person. Nature abhors lopsidedness. She turns out man as a whole, to be developed as a whole. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder,</b> whenever <b>I</b> come across a supernaturally pious, a supernaturally moral, a supernaturally cultured person, if they also have a reverse self.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nay, I {{remember}} me {{of a little}} rapture of George Richmond himself on those fair slopes of sunny sward, ending in a vision of Tobit and his dog--no less--led up there by the helpful angel. (<b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>wondered,</b> by the way, whether that blessed dog minded what the angel said to him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let it {{pass for}} that. It {{amounted}} to {{an effort to make}} your mental sclerosis infectious, and it was all the worse because, in you, the stiffening of the tastes had taken the form of aversions rather than preferences. You did not so much wish your readers to like your favorite authors as to hate all the others. At the time when there was a fad for making lists of The Hundred Best Authors, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> that you didn't put forth some such schedule." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} exceptions. I {{know which one}} you are {{thinking}} of. Thirdly, and lastly, after he is polished and made pretty, I shall, as you said, be his guide, philosopher and friend, and he shall become a success--as great a success as your friend. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> how that man got on.

6000|$|Tom Lokins {{was smoking}} his pipe, and Tom's pipe was an uncommonly black one, for he smoked it very often. Moreover, Tom's pipe was uncommonly short, so short that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> how he escaped burning {{the end of}} his nose. Indeed, some of the men said that the redness of the end of Tom's nose was owing to its being baked like a brick by the heat of his pipe. Tom took this pipe from his mouth, and while he was pushing down the tobacco with {{the end of his}} little finger, he said-- ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{very dear}} Clive," [...] Alice wrote. [...] "I am feeling awfully low {{spirited}} dearest since hearing such very terrible news relating to this fearful war.

6000|$|... "Robinson, was it? Well, we {{are always}} glad to see Comrade Robinson, <b>always.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if anybody else is {{thinking}} of calling?" ...|$|R

'You know <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had <b>wondered,</b> when {{my father}} was telling any of the {{circumstances}} of the fire to me, how it could be that a woman could sleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too late even to give shout or sound of any kind.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Major, you can't {{remember}} what comes natural to you. But I {{and the others}} remember, and that's why I am sorry. But for yourself I am glad, since although Aylward and Haswell have put a big thing through {{and are going to}} make a pot of money, this is no place for the likes of you, and now that you are going I will make bold to tell you that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> what you were doing here. By and by, Major, the row will come, as it has come more than once in the past, before your time." ...|$|E
60|$|I did so {{somewhat}} regretfully, for I felt {{just then}} {{that if this}} was the way they welcomed the emigrant in that country it would be a relief to do battle with the whole of them. Afterward I learned that when one understands his ways, which is difficult to do at first, there are many good qualities in the Western railroad-man. Still, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> why the friendless newcomer should be considered a fair mark for petty hostility, especially by those who formerly were poor themselves--all of which applies only to city-bred men who hold some small office, for those who live by hard labor in forest and prairie would share their last crust with the stranger.|$|E
6000|$|Then I got at {{mine and}} saw {{what they were talking}} about. The paper was full of it. It seemed that late the night before His Serene Highness the Prince of Saxburg-Leignitz (<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> why they call these chaps [...] "Serene") had been murderously {{assaulted}} in a dark street on his way back from the Casino to his yacht. Apparently he had developed the habit of going about without an escort, and some rough-neck, taking advantage of this, had laid for him and slugged him with considerable vim. The Prince had been found lying pretty well beaten up and insensible in the street by a passing pedestrian, and had been taken back to his yacht, where he still lay unconscious.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wonder</b> {{why such}} vast wide river-beds of pale {{boulders}} {{come out of}} the heart of the high-rearing, dramatic stone mountains, a few miles to the sea. A few miles only: and never more than a few threading water-trickles in river-beds wide enough for the Rhine. But that is how it is. The landscape is ancient, and classic--romantic, as if it had known far-off days and fiercer rivers and more verdure. Steep, craggy, wild, the land goes up to its points and precipices, a tangle of heights. But all jammed on top of one another. And in old landscapes, as in old people, the flesh wears away, and the bones become prominent. Rock sticks up fantastically. The jungle of peaks in this old Sicily.|$|R
6000|$|... “I have a {{thing in}} my knife that will do for that, sir,” Joyce said; and he {{produced}} from his pocket a knife with many blades, one of them being a long pricker. “It {{was given to me}} the day before we sailed, and <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> what use that thing could ever be. Here is a use for it at last.” ...|$|R
