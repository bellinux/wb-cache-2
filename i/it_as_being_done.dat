She, overwhelmed by the debt of her gratitude, had acceded to his request, and had been unable afterwards to depart from her word. She had said that it should be so, and she could not then turn upon him and declare that when she had given him her hand, she had been unaware of the presence of her other lover. There was an injustice, an unkindness, an ingratitude, a selfishness in this, which forbade her to think of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> by herself. It was better for her that she should suffer, though the suffering should be through her whole life, than that he should be disappointed. No doubt the man would suffer too,--her hero, her lover,--he with whom she would so willingly have risked everything, either with or without the diamonds. She could not, however, bear to think that Mr Whittlestaff should be so very prudent and so very wise solely on her behalf. She would go to him, but for other reasons than that. As she walked about the place half the day, up and down the long walk, she told herself that it was useless to contend with her love. She did love John Gordon; she knew that she loved him with her whole heart; she knew that she must be true to him;--but still she would marry Mr Whittlestaff, and do her duty in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call her. There would be a sacrifice--a sacrifice of two--but still it was justice.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Informed consent as stipulated in {{regulatory}} human research guidelines {{requires that}} a volunteer is well-informed {{about what will}} happen to them in a trial. However researchers are faced with a challenge of how to ensure that a volunteer agreeing {{to take part in a}} clinical trial is truly informed. We conducted a qualitative study among volunteers taking part in two HIV clinical trials in Uganda to find out how they defined informed consent and their perceptions of the trial procedures, study information and interactions with the research team. METHODS: Between January and December 2012, 23 volunteers who had been in the two trials for over 6 months, consented to be interviewed about their experience in the trial three times over a period of nine months. They also took part in focus group discussions. Themes informed by study research questions and emerging findings were used for content analysis. RESULTS: Volunteers defined the informed consent process in terms of their individual welfare. Only two of the volunteers reported having referred during the trial to the participant information sheets given at the start of the trial. Volunteers remembered the information they had been given at the start of the trial on procedures that involved drawing blood and urine samples but not information about study design and randomisation. Volunteers said that they had understood the purpose of the trial. They said that signing a consent form showed that they had consented to take part in the trial but they also described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>done</b> to protect the researcher in case a volunteer later experienced side effects. CONCLUSION: Volunteers pay more attention during the consent process to procedures requiring biological tests than to study design issues. Trust built between volunteers and the research team could enhance the successful conduct of clinical trials by allowing for informal discussions to identify and review volunteers' perceptions. These results point to the need for researchers to view informed consent as a process rather than an event...|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} water and {{sanitation}} services in England and Wales is regularly and comprehensively monitored by the economic regulator, OFWAT. OFWAT statistics show that service quality has improved since the early 1990s, i.e. shortly after services were privatised.

Ways to maintain confidentiality in therapy are stated, as well as situations in which it is inevitably limited. Three dilemmas concerning confidentiality are explained and discussed. The first is when one should speak and when one should be silent and what we should do when we are in two minds. The second is whether the client should be informed about confidentiality limitations at the very beginning, or when the need arises during the treatment. The third is whether confidentiality limitation (when a client poses a threat to himself or to the society) should be legally regulated, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in many western countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This report {{gives the}} current state of author’s {{research}} in the field of service discovery in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. Mobile devices need to cooperate to get benefit from the services offered by other devices and for this purpose these services have to be discovered using Service Discovery Protocols (SDPs). Twelve SDPs are selected for multihop mobile ad hoc networks and analyzed with respect to their service discovery architectures, management of service information, search methods, service selection, methods for supporting mobility and service description techniques. As P 2 P research in the field of searching and service discovery is more developed compared to the MANETs, therefore after this survey different techniques used in searching and service discovery protocols in P 2 P are given and discussed how these techniques can be useful in the context of MANETs. In the last it is discussed to exploit the heterogeneity of MANET systems <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in P 2 P to have improved and more efficient SDPs. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} for the design project started after studying {{the context of the}} city Brussels. During our studio group work it became apparent that Brussels is a highly fragmented city on different levels. The main research took a direction to search for techniques and tools that I could use in order to design in such a fragmented context. I became fascinated with the movie montage, since it is a technique that deals with strong cuts within different scenes, but it also aims to keep the whole understandable to the viewer. Especially the ‘intellectual montage’ as described by Sergei Eisenstein {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century became a leading theme in the research. The project focused on how to translate insights on how to manipulate time <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in movies into a spatial context that can be used in a design process. The design itself became a route through different time fragments in which the montage became the main tool in creating spatial interventions. Border ConditionsArchitectureArchitectur...|$|R

40|$|It {{is rather}} {{difficult}} to compare quantitatively flatness measuring results {{of one and}} the same object (e. g. in case of a long-term stability investigation) or the results of a series of products (e. g. from the same machinetool in order to indicate machinetool-influences). An extension of a computerprogram applied to the evaluation of flatness measurement (as described in the CIRP-Annals, vol. 26 (1977), no. 1), separates the form deviations of a surface into a geometrical part and a random part. The geometric part consists of a best-fitting non-flat, reference plane, composed of the single curvature of a sphere and the double curvature of a real twisted plane. Three parameters (the dimensionless curvature parameters of sphericity and torsion, together with the direction of the torsionvector) are able to characterize the geometrical part of the surface; a fourth one is a measure for the random part. Advantages of the method are demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} long-term investigation into the form stability of a granite surface plate. Another extension of the program makes it now possible to measure surfaces with non-rectangular contours in the same way <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in case of a rectangular surface plate. ...|$|R

30|$|Entrepreneurship is {{the act of}} {{establishing}} and managing a business venture {{for the purpose of}} making profit. Ma and Tan (2006) defined entrepreneurship as a generator of national prosperity and competitiveness. It is a process {{of establishing}} a business organization for the provision of goods and services, the creation of jobs which contribute to economic development (Bilic et al., 2011). It is the act of opening and running a business venture for rendering services to people, creation of employment opportunities, as well as making profit. Entrepreneurship in electronic technology refers to the establishment of new electronic ventures (Boutellier et al., 2010). Entrepreneurship can also be defined as a discipline, which can be learned, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in increasing quantity and quality across the globe (Kassean et al., 2015). Entrepreneurship in electronics is the establishment of electronic business enterprise in areas such as computer hardware/software designs/maintenance, electronic gadgets repairs, circuit designs, electronic gadgets production, among others. Kew et al. (2013) stated that promoting entrepreneurship amongst young people is important in reducing unemployment in the labour market where formal employment opportunities are scarce. There is a rising incidence of unemployment among graduates of electronic technology as well as other university graduates and those of other tertiary institutions (Bassey and Atan, 2012). Graduate unemployment accounts for more than 32 % of the total unemployed labour force between 1992 and 1997 (Bassey and Atan, 2012). This percentage has continued to increase instead of decreasing (Adawo and Atan, 2013). Sata (2013) stated that entrepreneurship creates a significant opportunity for individuals to achieve financial independence and benefit the economy by contributing to job creation, innovation, and economic growth. People that venture into entrepreneurship are known as entrepreneurs and are said to be enterprising individuals.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contract}} is to design the prototype tests necessary for the verification of the measurement methods proposed for the Mixed Waste Disposal Facility. The design {{is limited to the}} hydrological performance of the measurement methods. It does not include the mechanical testing of the methods proposed. The test site is to be selected and when approved, construction drawings provided. The contract also includes testing of vitrified clay pipe as the liner of choice for the passages under the landfill. The tests are to be done of both he hydrologic and the mechanical capability of the pipe. The test bed construction is to be supervised <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> by the construction contractor monitored by LANL. This contract does not include the logical subsequent work of performance of the measurements in the test bed. Since this contract was received by September 15, with the work to be completed by September 30, only that work possible in the short time was performed. That included the design of the test bed, the purchase of the vitrified clay pipe and the mechanical tests of the pipe, and the purchase of the SEAMIST systems for testing in the clay pipe. None of those could be delivered in time for flow tests to be done on the clay pipe. The mechanical tests were done as part of the pipe purchase and are reported here. The contract was not extended beyond September 30 for lack of funds. This report is therefore limited to the preliminary design of the test bed and to the specification of the orders for the materials. The hope is that funding will be restored to the program for the completion of the design and measurement effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} in markets, {{the distribution of}} limited resources based on productivity and performance, and the efficient management of universities are changing the criteria of trust and legitimacy of the educational system in Peru. Universities are perceived more as institutions of the public sector, while the services they offer must rather contribute to the modernization of the emerging society and the knowledge economy. Higher Educations reforms - initiated in the 1980 s - {{have been inspired by}} the successful university organizations that have managed to change their governance and addressed to transform certain bureaucratic institutions into organizations capable of playing active role in this global competition for resources and best talent. Within this context, Peruvian universities are facing two major challenges: adapting themselves to new global perspectives and being able to develop a better response to society demands, needs and expectations. This article proposes a model of governance system for higher education in Peru that gives a comprehensive solution to these challenges, allowing dealing with the problems of universities for their development and inclusion within the global trends. For this purpose, a holistic and qualitative methodologic approach was developed, considering an integrated method which considered educational reality as a whole, understanding its facts, components and elements that affects its outcomes. It is proposed to define a policy for university education in Peru that permeates society, by changing the planning model from a social reform model to a policy analysis model, where the Peruvian State acts as sole responsible for responding to the demanding society as its legal representative complemented with some external and independent bodies that define the basis of best practice, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is <b>being</b> <b>done</b> in many university models worldwide...|$|R
