It moved westward, and quickly strengthened under favorable conditions to reach top wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h).

Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjōs survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo's main force.|$|E

5|$|In 1930–31, aged 22, Fingleton {{regained his}} {{position}} {{at the start of}} the Sheffield Shield season for New South Wales, and first came to prominence when he withstood a ferocious opening spell against the express pace of Eddie Gilbert in Brisbane against Queensland. On one occasion, a particularly fast Gilbert delivery supposedly evaded both the batsman and wicket-keeper, travelled more than 60 metres and crashed through a fence before <b>hitting</b> <b>and</b> killing a dog on the other side. Fingleton scored 56 as a full strength team with Test players fell for 143. The visitors were set 392 for victory and played for a draw, with Fingleton adding 71 to prevent a collapse as the match was saved. He failed to pass single figures in his next four innings, and was dropped twice, before adding 32 not out and 26 as New South Wales lost to the touring West Indies. Fingleton did not play a full season and ended with 210 runs at 35.00 in five matches, including the two half-centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, McCabe scored {{centuries in}} all of his three Sheffield Shield innings, scoring 229* Queensland at Brisbane and 106 and 103* in one match against Victoria in Sydney, yielding a Shield season average of 438.00. His innings against Queensland was particularly lauded, showcasing his ability against the most hostile of fast bowling. Queensland's attack was led by Eddie Gilbert, an indigenous paceman who was the fastest in Australia and whom Bradman said was the fastest that he had ever faced. On one occasion, a particularly fast Gilbert delivery supposedly evaded both the batsman and wicket-keeper, travelled more than 60 metres and crashed through a fence before <b>hitting</b> <b>and</b> killing a dog on the other side. On this day, Gilbert knocked the bat out of Bradman's hand before removing him for a duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. This left New South Wales at effectively 4/21. Undeterred, McCabe came in and bravely counterattacked in a display that featured many aggressive hook and cut shots. The visitors made 432 before McCabe took a total of 3/27 to help his state take an innings win as the hosts were bowled out for 109 and 85. In the match against arch-rivals and defending champions Victoria, McCabe added 3/57 and 1/18 with the ball as New South Wales won by 239 runs, and went on to claim the title, despite McCabe not being able to contribute in final match of the season; he injured himself while in the field and was unable to bat in a 132-run defeat at the hands of South Australia.|$|E

40|$|Background: Minimal {{improvements}} in treatment or survival {{of patients with}} osteosarcoma have been achieved {{during the last three}} decades. Especially in the case of incomplete tumor resection, prognosis remains poor. Heavy ion radiotherapy (<b>HIT)</b> <b>and</b> modern anticancer drugs like histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promising effects in osteosarcoma in vitro. In this study, we tested the effect of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in a xenograft mouse model. Methods: Osteosarcoma xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of KHOS- 24 OS cells and treated with either vehicle (DMSO), SAHA, <b>HIT</b> or <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> SAHA. Tumor growth was determined and tumor necrosis, proliferation rate, apoptotic rate as well as vessel density were evaluated. Results: Here, we show that the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> SAHA induced a significant delay of tumor growth through increased rate of apoptosis, increased expression of p 53 and p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1, inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis compared to tumors treated with HIT only. Conclusion: <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> in particular the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> histone deacetylase inhibition is a promising treatment strategy in OS and may be tested in clinical trials...|$|R
