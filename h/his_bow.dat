5|$|Peirithous– A {{prisoner}} of the Underworld who possessed the Bow of Apollo {{and was in}} love with Persephone; he was imprisoned by Hades for trying to make off with her. He offered <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> to Kratos in exchange for freedom, but the uncaring Spartan ignored the offer, killed Peirithous, and took the bow anyway. The character was voiced by Simon Templeman in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
5|$|Skiklubben Ull {{was founded}} on 29 January 1883, and named after the Norse deity Ullr. In Norse mythology, Ullr was a god for hunting and competition, {{superior}} with his skis and <b>his</b> <b>bow.</b> SK Ull has been credited as being the second-oldest skiing club in the world, after Christiania SK. The club founders were a group of university students who socialized in apartments in Wessels gate. The young men usually conversed about their studies or played card games, {{but they were also}} hobby cross-country skiers, and decided to take up skiing in a more organized form by starting a club. The term describing a club member was ullaner.|$|E

5|$|The Marquess of Queensberry, {{the father}} of Wilde's lover Lord Alfred Douglas (who was on holiday in Algiers at the time), had planned to disrupt the play by {{throwing}} a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> {{at the end of}} the show. Wilde and Alexander learned of the plan, and the latter cancelled Queensberry's ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance. Nevertheless, he continued harassing Wilde, who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials ending in Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency. Alexander tried, unsuccessfully, to save the production by removing Wilde's name from the billing, but the play had to close after only 86 performances.|$|E
5|$|The raking fire inflicted massive {{damage and}} {{casualties}} on the French ship, and although Dénian continued to resist for some time, his ship {{was no longer}} effectively able to respond once Saumarez had crossed <b>his</b> <b>bow.</b> Eventually, with Circe now rapidly approaching with a strengthening of the wind, Dénian accepted {{that he had no}} choice but to surrender his vessel after an engagement lasting two hours and ten minutes. The cutter, which had been ignored during the battle, successfully escaped to Cherbourg while the captain of Sémillante, anchored in the harbour, made a fruitless effort to reach the engagement, delayed by contrary wind and tides that prevented the frigate from sailing.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{majority}} of cases Charles Peccatte signed <b>his</b> <b>bows</b> with <b>his</b> name in full, which is also common practice in his uncle and father’s work. He differed, however, by signing <b>his</b> <b>bows</b> {{on both sides of the}} stick. To sign the sticks in this manner is quite unusual in the history of French bow making. There is a possibility that he may have been trying to differentiate himself from his predecessors by doing so.|$|R
25|$|Philoctetes, {{due to a}} sedition, {{was driven}} from his city and emigrated to Italy, where he founded the cities of Petilia, Old Crimissa, and Chone, between Croton and Thurii.

25|$|The first soft paste {{porcelain}} {{manufactured in}} Britain came from factories in London, soon followed by factories in Staffordshire, Derby and Liverpool. The painter and mezzotintist Thomas Frye (1710–62) produced fine bone china at <b>his</b> <b>Bow</b> porcelain factory in East London. Bone china was also made at Lowestoft, at first mainly decorated in underglaze blue but later with Chinese-style over-glaze that also included pink and red.|$|E

The French frigate Sémillante, which had been anchored in the harbour, was unable to come to Réunion's rescue because of contrary wind and tides.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November Cruizer intercepted two French pirate luggers {{attempting}} {{to take a}} brig. Hancock chased them and after two hours captured Vengeur after <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> guns brought down the lugger's main topsail and main-lug sail. Vengeur was {{under the command of}} Jean Augustin Hirrel, carried a crew of 56 men, and was armed with 14 guns. She was two days out of Boulogne and had that day taken two Swedish brigs, one laden with salt, from Liverpool, the other from Boston, in Lincolnshire, in ballast.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} Belisarius' {{outburst}} {{was at first}} unclear, but as the Goths approached the moat, he drew forth <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> and shot, one after another, three Ostrogoth riders. The soldiers on the walls took this as an omen of victory and started to shout in celebration. Then Belisarius revealed his thought, as he ordered his archers to concentrate their fire on the exposed oxen, which the Goths had so thoughtlessly brought within bowshot distance from the walls. The oxen were dispatched quickly, and the four towers were left there, useless, before the walls.|$|E
25|$|When the Scarlet Witch {{inadvertently}} alters reality, Hawkeye is resurrected with {{no memory}} of previous events. When a young mutant named Layla Miller gives several heroes (including Hawkeye) the ability to remember, he is horrified at the Scarlet Witch's actions. Hawkeye shoots Wanda {{in the back with}} an arrow. In retaliation, one of her recreated children wipes Hawkeye from existence, killing him once more. When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead. However, the recently formed New Avengers find <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> and arrows {{on the site of the}} old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.|$|E

ApoIlo’s target is the centaur immediately before him, BM 522:4, who has grabbed hold of a woman carrying an infant, BM 522:3. Only she among {{the women in the}} Centauromachy is in the clutches of a centaur, yet undefended by a mortal.|$|E

25|$|Aftermath: The stage {{lights up}} for a final time, {{revealing}} the same boat the twins used {{to return to the}} land. Triumphant after the battle, peace and harmony has been restored to all of the empire. The twins now rule the empire, and each has married their beloved met on their journey. The Chief Archer has vowed peace, and symbolizes this by breaking <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> over his knee. The Counselor's Son also returns. Although not dead, he has been blinded by the battle. To show he has realized the error of his ways, he makes a magnificent display through fireworks. Kà ends the way it started; in celebration.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} exchanges, Réunion {{had lost her}} fore yard and mizzen topmast while Crescent had lost the top off her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut {{and a number of}} sails damaged but Crescent was still able to {{manoeuvre}} across Réunion's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although Réunion continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively. With Saumarez about to cross <b>his</b> <b>bow</b> and Circe now rapidly approaching due to a strengthening wind, Dénian realised {{he had no choice but}} to surrender his vessel.

25|$|Dmitri Shostakovich {{entered the}} Petrograd Conservatory at age 13, {{becoming}} the youngest student there. He studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev and composition with Rimsky-Korsakov's son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg. He {{proved to be}} a disciplined, hard-working student. Glazunov may have recognized in Shostakovich an echo of his younger self. He carefully monitored his progress in Steinberg's class and, in awarding him his doctorate, recommended Shostakovich for a higher degree which normally would have led to a professorship. Due to his family's financial hardship, Shostakovich was not {{able to take advantage of}} this opportunity. Glazunov also arranged for the premiere of Shostakovich's First Symphony, which took place on 12 March 1926 with the Leningrad Philharmonic under Nikolai Malko. This was 44 years after Glazunov's First Symphony had first been presented in the same hall. In another instance of déjà vu with Glazunov's early life, the symphony caused almost as much of a sensation as the appearance of the 19-year-old Shostakovich on the stage awkwardly taking <b>his</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|E
