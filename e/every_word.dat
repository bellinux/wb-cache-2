5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, {{he also did}} not decipher <b>every</b> <b>word</b> and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf made {{a new and more}} accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae.|$|E
5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe {{that his father had}} little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe <b>every</b> <b>word</b> of the Bible and catechism.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington {{so that she could}} precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that <b>every</b> <b>word</b> attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E
40|$|The cloze test usually {{consists}} of a graded reading passage from which words have been deleted according to some methodical strategy. such as <b>every</b> fifth <b>word.</b> <b>every</b> tenth <b>word.</b> <b>every</b> pronoun. etc. The deleted words are replaced with blanks of a uniform size. and the student is asked {{to fill in the}} blanks with the most appropriate word...|$|R

5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe <b>every</b> <b>word</b> of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Zeffirelli, whose Hamlet was heavily cut, Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, {{and starred in}} a 1996 version containing <b>every</b> <b>word</b> of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's Hamlet runs for just over four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time; and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship with Kate Winslet's Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd).|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that <b>every</b> <b>word</b> is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
30|$|Berger et al. (2000) chose a {{word from}} its answer for <b>every</b> <b>words</b> in each question. It was the word that maximized mutual {{information}} between the question word and the answer word itself. After this, {a word in a question → a word in an answer} denotes the query expansion using this method.|$|R
5000|$|The {{patterns}} of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of [...] "classical Chinese novels" [...] found proverb use {{as frequently as}} one proverb <b>every</b> 3,500 <b>words</b> in Water Margin (Sui-hu chuan) and one proverb <b>every</b> 4,000 <b>words</b> in Wen Jou-hsiang. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.|$|R

5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for <b>every</b> <b>word.</b> Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev {{began his}} memoirs. He {{dictated}} {{them into a}} tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that <b>every</b> <b>word</b> would be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency {{made no attempt to}} interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments when his son Sergei was approached by the KGB and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev turned over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title Khrushchev Remembers. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, Izvestia denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, {{and it was the first}} time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: ″In his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism".|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning {{to the purpose of}} prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, <b>every</b> <b>word</b> of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of <b>every</b> <b>word,</b> has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E

25|$|Wang {{also had}} a line called Alliance, {{which was based on}} the high end OIS (140/145) {{hardware}} architecture. It had more powerful software compared to the OIS word processing and list processing packages. The system was Tempest certified, leading to global deployment in American embassies after the Iran hostage crisis. The most significant enhancement was in the indexing capabilities of the Alliance system; documents could be indexed by <b>every</b> <b>word</b> contained in them. The database product, Visual Memory, permitted <b>every</b> <b>word</b> in each field to be indexed. In addition to the advanced indexing features, the Alliance word processor was also substantially enhanced, even though the Z80 platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an 8-bit application in a 64KB workstation.|$|E

Instead of the option to create words four letters or more, teams must find a four letter word, a five letter word, then a six or seven letter word in that order and then the cycle repeats itself until time. This is done to prevent teams from quickly finding four letter words that rhyme with each other or are {{homonyms}} {{as well as to}} find more words that are six or seven letters long.
