5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a <b>ground</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E
25|$|From a <b>ground</b> <b>survey,</b> the Corps had {{identified}} nine breaches {{that must be}} repaired to provide a minimum level of protection to the affected parishes. Of these, seven had been repaired to date, one was being used to allow drainage to leave St. Bernard’s Parish and one was being addressed in Plaquemines Parish. Additionally, levees had been deliberately notched at two sites in St. Bernard's Parish to facilitate the unwatering mission. Of these, one had been closed and one was still in use.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Darwin, McGinness and Gorham traveled back to Cloncurry {{to survey}} and build landing routes {{on the way}} there, while Fysh was to stay in Darwin and create suitable landing strips there and at Katherine. In a letter addressed to General Legge dated to 30 October 1919, Fysh rejected {{the use of the}} racecourse in Darwin, which was originally picked by Reginald Lloyd (the head of the first <b>ground</b> <b>survey</b> to find a suitable route for the aircraft), as the landing ground for the winning aircraft. He then suggested an alternate strip, locating one near Fannie Bay, to the north of Darwin. Shortly before the landing of the Smith brothers, the landing strip at Fannie Bay was completed at the cost of £A700.|$|E

This meant the earlier <b>ground</b> <b>surveying</b> needed to be repeated. Triangulation tends to be more accurate on the larger scale and in the City the dual approach was very successful but in rural areas there were too few prominent landmarks for triangulation to be effective.|$|R
30|$|The 2016 Kumamoto {{earthquake}} {{sequence in}} Japan caused large crustal deformation, and exposed faults {{have been identified}} by <b>ground</b> <b>surveys</b> (Geological Survey of Japan 2016; Goto et al. 2016; Kumahara et al. 2016; Shirahama et al. 2016) and aerial photographs (Nakano et al. 2016).

40|$|Airborne {{bathymetric}} LiDAR {{was collected}} for 220 river kilometers in the Yakima and Trinity River Basins in the United States. Concomitant with the aerial data collection, <b>ground</b> <b>surveys</b> {{of the river}} bed were performed in both basins. We assess {{the quality of the}} bathymetric LiDAR survey from the perspective of its application toward creating accurate, precise, and complete streambed topography for numerical modeling and geomorphic assessment. Measurement error is evaluated with respect to <b>ground</b> <b>surveys</b> for magnitude and spatial variation. Analysis of variance statistics indicate that residuals from two independent <b>ground</b> <b>surveys</b> in similar locations do not come from the same population and that mean errors at different study locations also come from different populations. Systematic error indicates a consistent bias in the data and random error falls within values of expected precision.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game conducted the aerial surveys after 1959 and Mike Nelson (ADF&G Dillingham) was responsible for standardizing the aerial survey methods.

50|$|Cameron Island is a {{small island}} just north of Hailstorm Island, in the Swain Islands, Antarctica. This region was photographed from the air by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47), ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) (1956), and the Soviet {{expedition}} (1956). The island was included in a 1957 <b>ground</b> <b>survey</b> by C.R. Eklund, who named it for Richard L. Cameron, chief glaciologist at Wilkes Station, 1957.|$|E
