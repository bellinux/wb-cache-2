This study investigated mild psychotic experiences in <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> and majority adolescents in a Dutch representative general population sample, and tested the ethnic density effect in the classroom. The CAPE was used to assess mild psychotic experiences among Dutch (n = 3, 606) and non-Western <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> pupils (n = 769). <b>Ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> adolescents showed higher levels of grandiosity and delusions than their ethnic majority peers, whereas no differences were found for hallucinations, paranormal beliefs and paranoia between both groups of adolescents. The ethnic density effect was partly confirmed for the ethnic majority: a decrease of ethnic majority pupils in class increased their feelings of paranoia. Because only some dimensions of mild psychotic experiences were affected by <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> status or the interaction between <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> status and <b>ethnic</b> class composition, our findings emphasize that mild psychotic experiences are multifactorial in origin, with different underlying processes...|$|R

This article examines how gender quotas {{as a form of}} equality policy affect <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups, in particular, the gender balance among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> candidates for political office. Our analysis focuses on the selection of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> candidates in Belgium, where legally binding quotas exist, and in the Netherlands, where they do not. Drawing on 23 interviews with central actors in four main parties in each country, we find that the process of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> candidate selection is highly gendered: in both countries, <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> women are represented in larger numbers than <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> men. But gender quotas play a lesser role in this than the more general concern for diversity on electoral lists, the institutionalisation of gender/ethnicity within political parties and the strategic choices of party leaders...|$|R
40|$|Mental health among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups {{living with}} {{diabetes}} in the UK {{is an area}} that requires urgent attention from the research communities in UK. Globally diabetes affects more than 422 million people while in the UK more than 4 million people are affected by diabetes. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups in the UK are at least six times more at risk of developing diabetes than the general population. In similar trend, mental health has been reported to be more prevalent among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> in the UK. Already <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups experience poorer health outcomes from diabetes leading to complications like mental health. This is because diabetes and mental health have two-way relationship. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight the need for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> specific research into the extent of mental health issues among the growing number of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups living with diabetes in the UK. This therefore requires that research communities focus more on the issue of mental health among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups living with diabetes in the UK. Review of factsheets surrounding Mental health and diabetes among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups has been brought together to point out this area that has witnessed limited research among healthcare researchers. The economic and clinical burden of the issue of mental health has been highlighted to reiterate the need for research and clinical efforts to prevent mental health complications among <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups living with diabetes in the UK...|$|R

40|$|School belongingness {{has proven}} its {{positive}} effect {{on a wide range}} of outcomes that lead to school success. However, the factors that influence school belongingness received little research attention. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the impact of ethnic victimization on <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students’ school belongingness. Hereto, we examine the relative impact of ethnic and non-ethnic victimization, since <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students belong to a stigmatized social category, which creates unique stressors such as ethnic victimization, but does not spare them from the general stressors that exist in life. Moreover, we approach victimization from a social-ecological perspective. First, by focusing on both victimization by peers and victimization by teachers and second, by taking the ethnic school composition into account. A multilevel analysis on a largescale dataset (N = 1160 <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students, 54 schools) collected in the third year of secondary education in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) shows that victimization had a negative influence on <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students’ sense of school belonging. Furthermore, the experience of ethnic victimization was more detrimental for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students’ sense of school belonging than the experience of other forms of victimization. Thirdly, it did not matter for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students’ sense of school belonging if they felt victimized by teachers or by peers. Finally, when experiencing ethnic teacher victimization in a school with fewer <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students, this was more negative for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students’ sense of school belonging than in a school with more <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students...|$|R

This dissertation aimed to explain the differences in study success between ethnic majority students and <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students from the perspective of psychosocial and academic-related skills in relation to academic success. The research reported in this dissertation has highlighted several issues related to the less successful academic careers of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students. One important issue is the quality of interaction with faculty and peers as it are the formal interactions with teachers and fellow students that made <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students feel at home in their educational program. Furthermore, high quality formal relationships, as part {{of the quality of the}} education, prevent <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students from dropping out from higher education. Next to the learning environment, students’ families also play a role in obtaining study success. More specifically, the less successful academic careers of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students can partly be explained by their higher levels of participation in activities with or for their family, and by the less effective family social support they receive in comparison with ethnic majority students. Finally, the results concerning academic-related skills (e. g., time management) do not seem to explain the less successful academic careers of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students. These findings yield practical implications for improving the student success of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students in particular, such as inviting students’ families to the academic domain and fostering high quality formal relationships with faculty and fellow students. More research is needed to further improve our understanding of the less successful academic performance and study progress of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students, to ultimately reach the day that chances for success for both groups of students are the same...|$|R

40|$|Educational {{research}} {{has provided evidence}} that racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students are disadvantaged in today’s educational systems. Teachers’ stereotypical expectations are believed to contribute to these disadvantages because teachers make decisions about grades, special education, tracking, and school placement. Research so far has shown that teachers’ stereotypical expectations might lead to biased judgments, but the cognitive processes underlying those judgments are less clear. Using an experimental design, we investigated whether inservice and preservice teachers’ judgment accuracy depended on the ethnicity of the students. Moreover, in employing a recognition task, {{we were able to}} investigate the kinds of information teachers’ took into account about <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students when making school placement recommendations. In a sample of 64 inservice and preservice teachers, judgments were found to be less accurate for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students than for ethnic majority students, and teachers felt less confident about the judgments they made for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students. This lower accuracy of school placement recommendations involved recommendations of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students to both higher and lower placements than could be justified academically. The recognition data revealed that under- and overestimation of <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students were due to a less accurate encoding of the information about <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students than about ethnic majority students and that grade information for <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> students in particular was not strongly encoded. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for tracked systems and in terms of interventions that might have the potential to reduce stereotype application...|$|R

Methods Data were derived from the Dutch 2002 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional study {{with a total of}} 5, 730 adolescents, aged 11 – 18 and attending secondary school, of which 931 belong to <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> groups. The data were analysed using a multilevel regression model.
