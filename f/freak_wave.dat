The evolution of the <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> in deep water are analyzed. We investigate the effect of initial wave parameters on kurtosis and occurrence of <b>freak</b> <b>waves.</b> The results show that Benjamin-Feir index (BFI) is an important parameter to identify the presence of instability. The kurtosis presents a similar spatial evolution trend with the occurrence probability of <b>freak</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Freak</b> <b>waves</b> in a random sea state {{are more likely to}} occur for narrow spectrum and small values of significant wave height...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of the possible existence of so-called <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> regarding structural design is discussed. At first the framework for design of offshore structures on the Norwegian continental shelf is presented {{for the purpose of}} indicating the annual exceedance probabilities of concern regarding design. The adequacy of the second order random model for the sea surface process is briefly indicated. It is suggested that <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> should be defined as wave events from a population not captured by the second order model. Evidences of the existence of <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> are discussed and possible originating mechanisms for their existence are commented upon. Finally, a probabilistic framework for accounting for <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> in design is presented. The approach is illustrated by assessing the total wave induced load on a generic jacket structure...|$|R

The ship returned to operations in the Indian Ocean, and on 17 October was unsuccessfully fired on by a German U-boat. Between late 1943 and early 1944, the destroyer was based in Kenya, then was transferred on 8 March to the Bay of Bengal. During her time based here, Nizam participated in Operation Cockpit, a carrier air raid on Japanese assets in south-east Asia. In November, the destroyer sailed to Melbourne for another refit. In a tragedy which harked back to that of 21 October 1941, on 11 February 1945, while crossing the Great Australian Bight in poor weather after the refit, Nizam was hit by a <b>freak</b> <b>wave</b> which caused the ship to roll almost eighty degrees to port, and washed ten sailors overboard, none of whom were ever seen again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study {{on how the}} significance of wind action differs when varying the wave parameters. The quasi arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method (QALE-FEM) is used for this purpose. An improved model for wind-excited pressure and wind-driven current, which is recently developed by {{the authors of this}} paper [27], is coupled with the QALE-FEM. Many cases involving <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> with different focusing time/point and frequency ranges under the action of winds are investigated. The results show that the significance of wind actions on <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> strongly depends on the focusing time, the focusing point and the frequency range.
