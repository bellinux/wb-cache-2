The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E

500|$|Released in 2007, Saawariya saw Kapoor play a Muslim woman {{awaiting}} {{the return of}} her lover opposite Mukerji and Ranbir Kapoor. It was the first Indian feature film produced by a Hollywood studio, Sony Pictures Entertainment. Saawariya {{proved to be a}} major critical and commercial failure. Writing for BBC, Jaspreet Pandohar called the film a [...] "misfire on a massive scale". Raja Sen of Rediff.com described <b>her</b> <b>laugh</b> as [...] "almost as infectious as her father's", but wished that she had been [...] "allowed to simper softly, instead of having a clearly overdubbed plastic giggle plastered onto her."

500|$|Fuse writer Jason Newman {{called the}} clip an ode to D'Angelo {{and went on}} to state it worked as part {{underwear}} commercial, part shower commercial. Writing for the Italian edition of Vogue, Valentina Veneziano concluded that the video showcased Beyoncé's positive attitude portrayed through <b>her</b> <b>laugh</b> in [...] "Rocket". Meghan O'Keefe from VH1 argued that the video was the first to focus on Beyoncé's [...] "voluptuous curve, toned muscle, raised goosebumps and bleached strands of bed head". Brent DiCrescenzo from the magazine Time Out found influences by Madonna from her work on the album Erotica (1992) and the book Sex (1992). Vanity Fair reviewer Michelle Collins opined that the video opened with shots of Beyoncé on a bed to slightly change the overall feeling present on the album. Insanul Ahmed writing in Complex remarked that things [...] "get sensual" [...] in [...] "Rocket"'s clip. Whitney Phaneuf of the website HitFix was more critical towards the visual, saying that it [...] "may be the sexiest video of the bunch, but it's achieved in such a conventional way that it ends up being boring". On December 21, 2013, eight days following the release of the video for [...] "Rocket", CTV News reported that the hotel where the clip was filmed would earn profit from the exposure in the album.|$|E

[...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E

But Jesse is the only character within the show able to tease and amuse her. The actress added [...] " [...] <b>her</b> <b>laugh</b> and he doesn't give in to her demands, which is even more attractive to her."

2500|$|She {{also had}} her critics, {{particularly}} in her later years {{among the new}} generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. George Bernard Shaw wrote of the [...] "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with <b>her,</b> <b>laugh</b> at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her widely when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you." [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote: [...] "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!" [...] Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that [...] "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience." [...] He wrote that in her roles, [...] "enchantment is smothered in artifice." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After {{having been}} {{told of the}} {{successful}} coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hjärne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because {{she knew she was}} not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksråd Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made <b>her</b> <b>laugh,</b> among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hjärne. Countess Hjärne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant [...] "And the riksråd Ribbing is her favorite." [...] The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman: [...] "information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen". [...] her contact with Rosencrone {{is said to have been}} restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.|$|E
2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making <b>her</b> <b>laugh.</b> Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
