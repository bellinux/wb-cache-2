40|$|Morphological {{quantification}} of {{the complex}} structure of hierarchical geomaterials is of great relevance for Earth science and environmental engineering, among others. To date, methods that quantify the 3 D morphology on length scales ranging from a few tens of nanometers to several hun-dred nanometers have had limited success. We demonstrate, for the first time, {{that it is possible}} to go beyond visualization and to extract quantitative morphological information from X-ray images in the aforementioned length scales. As examples, two different hierarchical geomaterials exhibiting complex porous structures ranging from nanometer to macroscopic scale are studied: a <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> water suspension and two hydrated cement pastes. We show that from a single projection image it is possible to perform a direct computation of the ultra-small angle-scattering spectra. The predictions matched very well the experimental data obtained by the best ultra-small angle-scattering experimental setups as observed for the cement paste. In this context, we demonstrate that the structure of <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> suspension exhibit two well-distinct regimes of aggregation, a dense mass fractal aggregation at short distance and a more open structure at large distance, which can be generated by a 3 D reaction limited cluster-cluster aggregation process. For the first time, a high-resolution 3 D image of fibrillar cement paste cluster was obtained from limited angle nanotomography...|$|E
40|$|Permeable {{concrete}} is used {{to reduce}} local flooding in urban areas. However, it is prone to clogging by particulate matter and requires regular maintenance. This paper reports {{on the performance of}} permeable concrete exposed to different clogging test methods to further understand this complex phenomena. New methods were developed to study the clogging effect and to define a clogging potential. The tests involve applying flowing water containing sand and/or clay in cycles through the sample and measuring the change in flow rate. Clogging depends on the applied solution and exposure method used. Significant permeability reductions were observed in all samples, particularly when simultaneously exposed to sand and clay. This is because <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> adhered to surface of sand particles and this caused increased clogging...|$|E

The clay minerals are of the kaolinite group. As flocculants, various chlorides differ one hundred-fold and sodium salts twenty-fold in the concentrations ecessary to <b>flocculate</b> a <b>clay</b> to a fixed sett!ing rate. The concentrations of individual chlorides necessary to <b>flocculate</b> different <b>clays</b> vary three-fold and the con-centrations of individual sodium salts vary ten-fold. In all cases the higher the valence of the cation the lower is the concentration required for flocculation; the relative ffectiveness, however, varies with the clay. The relative ffectiveness of the anions as flocculants varies greatly with the clay and no definite order of effectiveness i apparent. I-[alloysite requires less electrolyte for flocculation and has a larger settling volume than kaolinite. Well crystallized kaolinite has a smaller settling volume than poorly crystal-lized kaolinite.

40|$|Hedley er al. (1982) {{developed}} {{what has}} become the most widely used land modified), phosphorus (P) fractionation technique. It consists of sequential extraction of increasingly less phytoavailable P pools. Extracts are centrifuged at up to 25000 g (RCF) and filtered to 0. 45 mu m to ensure that soil is not lost between extractions. In attempting to transfer this method to laboratories with limited facilities, it was considered that access to high-speed centrifuges, and the cost of frequent filtration may prevent adoption of this P fractionation technique. The modified method presented here was developed to simplify methodology, reduce cost, and therefore increase accessibility of P fractionation technology. It provides quantitative recovery of soil between extractions, using low speed centrifugation without filtration. This is achieved by increasing the ionic strength of dilute extracts, through the addition of NaCl, to <b>flocculate</b> <b>clay</b> particles. Addition of NaCl does not change the amount of P extracted. Flocculation with low speed centrifugation produced extracts comparable with those having undergone filtration (0. 025 mu m). A malachite green colorimetric method was adopted for inorganic P determination, as this simple manual method provides high sensitivity with negligible interference from other anions. This approach can also be used for total P following digestion, alternatively non-discriminatory methods, such as inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, may be employed...|$|R

For this purpose, two different polymerization routes are considered; a low-temperature melt polymerization technique and the conventional solution-melt one. Under the specific experimental conditions, lack of clay exfoliation is detected through XRD measurements, which is proved irreversible even when twin-screw extrusion is attempted as an additional step. The resulting PA n, 6 -clay structures are found dependent on the diamine moiety length; more specifically, an intrinsic interaction between the polyamide monomer and the organoclay surfactant is indicated.

40|$|The {{fabric of}} sediments {{recovered}} at sites drilled on the Indus Fan, Owen Ridge, and Oman margin during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 117 was examined by {{scanning electron microscopy}} to document changes that accompany sediment burial. Two sediment types were studied: (1) biogenic sediments consisting {{of a variety of}} marly nannofossil and nannofossil oozes and chalks and (2) terrigenous sediments consisting of fine-grained turbidites deposited in association with the Indus Fan. Biogenic sediments were examined with samples from the seafloor to depths of 306 m below seafloor (mbsf) on the Owen Ridge (Site 722) and 368 mbsf on the Oman margin (Sites 723 and 728). Over these depth ranges the biogenic sediments are characterized by a random arrangement of microfossils and display little chemical diagenetic alteration. The microfossils are dispersed within a fine-grained matrix that is predominantly microcrystalline carbonate particles on the Owen Ridge and clay and organic matter on the Oman margin. Sediments with abundant siliceous microfossils display distinct, open fabrics with high porosity. Porosity reduction resulting from gravitational compaction appears to be the primary process affecting fabric change in the biogenic sediment sections. Fabric of illite-rich clayey silts and silty claystones from the Indus Fan (Site 720) and Owen Ridge (Sites 722 and 731) was examined for a composite section extending from 45 to 985 mbsf. In this section fabric of the fine-grained turbidites changes from one with small <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> domains, random particle arrangement, and high porosity to a fabric with larger domains, strong preferred particle orientation roughly parallel to bedding, and lower porosity. These changes are accomplished by a growth in domain size, primarily through increasing face-to-face contacts, and by particle reorientation which is characterized by a sharp increase in alignment with bedding between 200 and 400 mbsf. Despite extensive particle reorientation, <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> fabric persists in the deepest samples examined, particularly adjacent to silt grains, and the sediments lack fissility. Fabric changes over the 45 - 985 mbsf interval occur in response to gravitational compaction. Porosity reduction and development of preferred particle orientation in the Indus Fan and Owen Ridge sections occur at greater depths than outlined in previous fabric models for terrigenous sediments as a consequence of a greater abundance of silt and a greater abundance of illite and chlorite clays...|$|E
40|$|The Sheepbed {{mudstone}} {{forms the}} base of the strata examined by the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater on Mars, and is the first bona fide mudstone known on another planet. From images and associated data, this contribution proposes a holistic interpretation of depositional regime, diagenesis and burial history. A lake basin probably received sediment pulses from alluvial fans. Bed cross-sections show millimetre to centimetre-scale layering due to distal pulses of fluvial sediment injections (fine-grained hyperpycnites), fall-out from river plumes, and some aeolian supply. Diagenetic features include mineralized synaeresis cracks and millimetre-scale nodules, as well as stratiform cementation. Clay minerals were initially considered due to in situ alteration, but bulk rock chemistry and mineralogy suggests that sediments were derived from variably weathered source rocks that probably contained pre-existing clay minerals. X-ray diffraction analyses show contrasting clay mineralogy in closely spaced samples, consistent with at least partial detrital supply of clay minerals. A significant (ca 30 wt%) amorphous component is consistent with little post-depositional alteration. Theoretical modelling of diagenetic reactions, as well as kinetic considerations, suggest that the bulk of diagenetic clay mineral formation occurred comparatively late in diagenesis. Diagenetic features (synaeresis cracks and nodules) were previously thought to reflect early diagenetic gas formation, but an alternative scenario of synaeresis crack formation via fabric collapse of <b>flocculated</b> <b>clays</b> appears more likely. The observed diagenetic features, such as solid nodules, hollow nodules, matrix cement and ‘raised ridges’ (synaeresis cracks) can be explained with progressive alteration of olivine/glass in conjunction with centrifugal and counter diffusion of reactive species. Anhydrite-filled fractures in the Sheepbed mudstone occurred late in diagenesis when fluid pressures built up to exceed lithostatic pressure. Generating fluid overpressure by burial to facilitate hydraulic fracturing suggests a burial depth of at least 1000 m for the underlying strata that supplied these fluids...|$|R
40|$|Septarian concretions in the Staffin Shales Formation (Kimmeridgian, Isle of Skye) allow {{controls}} on concretion rheology and septarian cracking to be investigated. Stratabound concretions consist of anhedral ferroan calcite microspar enclosing clay and minor pyrite. Intergranular volumes range from 77 % to 88 %, and calcite δ 13 C and δ 18 O values in most concretion bodies range from − 10 · 0 ‰ to − 17 · 3 ‰ and + 0 · 3 ‰ to − 0 · 6 ‰ respectively, consistent with rapid and pervasive cementation in marine pore fluids. Septarian rupture occurred during incipient cementation, with a sediment volume reduction {{of up to}} 43 %. Crack-lining brown fibrous calcite records pore fluid re-oxygenation during a depositional hiatus, followed by increasing Fe content and δ 13 C related to bacterial methanogenesis. Brown colouration results from an included gel-like polar organic fraction that probably represents bacterially degraded biomass. A new hypothesis for concretion growth and septarian cracking argues that quasi-rigid 'proto-concretions' formed via binding of <b>flocculated</b> <b>clays</b> by bacterial extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS). This provided rheological and chemical conditions for tensional failure, subcritical crack growth, volume contraction, calcite nucleation, and incorporation of degraded products into crack-lining cements. Bacterial decay of EPS and syneresis of host muds provided internal stresses to initiate rupture at shallow burial. Development of septarian (shrinkage) cracks in muds is envisaged to require pervasive in situ bacterial colonization, and to depend on rates of carbonate precipitation versus EPS degradation and syneresis. Subsequent modification of septarian concretions included envelopment by siderite and calcite microspar, hydraulic fracturing associated with Cretaceous shallow burial or Palaeogene uplift; and cementation by strongly ferroan, yellow sparry calcite that records meteoric water invasion of the host mudrocks. An abundance of fatty acids in these spars indicates aqueous transport of organic breakdown products, and δ 13 C data suggest a predominantly methanogenic bicarbonate source. However, the wide δ 18 O range for petrographically identical cement (− 1 · 3 ‰ to − 15 · 6 ‰) is difficult to explain...|$|R

A vast majority of these state controlled roads are located {{in areas where the}} insitu material is dominated by reactive soil. Mixing lime with the reactive subgrade is a stabilisation technology to not only improve construction workability in these soils but to also reduce maintenance frequency on the road system. Lime stabilisation is used to modify sub grade soils to improve constructability by improving plastic properties, flocculating particles and drying the material. Studies indicate that lime stabilisation will improve load bearing capacity and will also achieve long term strength retention. DTMR Specifications and AUSTROADS Pavement design guidelines for lime modified sub grade recommends the Unconfined Compressive Strength achieve a minimum of 1. 5 MPa at 28 days (unsoaked). This research will assess current test results against the original test results at completion of construction. DTMR standards specify that lime stabilisation of subgrade material shall be carried out as 2 passes by applying half the dose in the first pass, waiting 24 hours then applying the remaining dosage in the last pass. This time period between passes is called the Amelioration Period. The major issue with having a 24 hour period for amelioration is it takes a longer time to finish construction. This delay has potential impacts on the contractor and exposes the open subgrade to potential weather such as rain for a longer period. Amelioration is necessary in heavy clays as adequate mixing is difficult to achieve in one pass as heavy clays tend to clump together. Allowing 24 hours between passes permits the lime to <b>flocculate</b> <b>clay</b> particles and improve workability. Amelioration results in better mixing in the second run and construction also becomes easier. This research will test a range of reduced time period to determine what length of time will achieve the Unconfined Compressive Strength of 1. 5 MPa. This research project will confirm that stabilising the road pavement sub grade with lime is an effective and economic solution when applied in the appropriate environment and quantity. It is also expected that improvements will continue to be made to lime stabilisation specifications. ...|$|R

40|$|The geomechanical {{behaviour}} of {{a variety}} of soft rocks from the Waitemata Group, Auckland, is characterised, and the influence of microstructure in determining the geomechanics examined. Field geotechnical measurements of joint spacing and Schmidt Hammer rebound are related to geomechanical properties to determine controls on joint development and applicability of field index tests for soft materials. Samples studied are dominantly sandstones, with one conglomerate; all of which have a significant component of swelling clay minerals. Low bulk densities, high porosities and large void ratios are characteristic of the samples. They vary from extremely weak, very low durability rocks to moderately: strong and durable materials. Extremely weak sandstones are highly deformable and undergo plastic deformation when loaded in compression. The stronger samples undergo strain softening and respond elastically to applied stresses prior to brittle failure. High softening factors indicate that compressive and tensile strengths are greatly reduced upon saturation. All the study rocks have high proportions of sand and silt size material (≤ 95 %), and up to 10 % of < 2 μ m proportions; significant gravel size material only occurs in the conglomerate. Volcanic and detrital rock fragments are the dominant constituents in all samples, with abundant quartz, minor calcic plagioclase, and a variety of accessory minerals. The dominant clay is smectite with lesser amounts of illite, kaolinite, and mixed-layer clays. Individual sand and silt grains are dominantly subrounded to subangular quartz, regular bricks of feldspar, and rods of rutile, and are often clay coated. Microaggregates and grains are combined into aggregates and assemblages, and in some cases macroassemblages, to form granular arrangements, which produce a network of interconnecting pores. The fabric of the rocks is characterised by discontinuous matrices. Fabric types range from skeletal to turbostratic, and arrangements range from tightly interlocking grains to loose granular structures. Clay micro aggregates are either flocculated or form welded FF honeycomb arrangements. Strength and durability are not influenced by quantity, size, or type of clasts or minerals present; rather, it is the arrangement of individual components (and associated pore spaces) in the rock fabric which directly determines the geomechanical behaviour. Strong, durable samples have an abundance of clean grain to grain contacts, and few large clay aggregates. Clay microaggregates are arranged in welded FF arrangements, and pore space is restricted to micropores which resist water infiltration. Progressively weaker rocks are characterised by an increase in clay coated grains, clay aggregates, and clay connectors (which form weak links for stress transmission), and interconnecting pores at all levels in the fabric. In the weakest rock macroassemblages of clay coated grains, and open flocculated smectitic aggregates connected by point contacts, produce a network of macropores, allowing easy access of water which <b>flocculates</b> <b>clays</b> into weaker states by reducing bonding and cohesion. Schmidt rebound values in the field do not provide a useful indication of either compressive or tensile strength of these rocks. The rebound values do, however, correlate well with laboratory determined dynamic elasticity values, suggesting that the instrument should be used in the field to predict rock elasticity and not strength. Joint spacing within the rock units is related to elasticity with units capable of storing stress through plastic deformation having reasonably wide, uniformly spaced joints. Units which release stress through brittle fracture have closely spaced, and more complex joint systems...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentary facies in {{the distal}} parts of deep-marine lobes can diverge {{significantly}} from those predicted by classical turbidite models, and sedimentological processes in these environments are poorly understood. This gap may be bridged using outcrop studies and theoretical models. In the Skoorsteenberg Formation (South Africa), a downstream transition from thickly bedded turbidite sandstones to argillaceous, internally layered hybrid beds, is observed. The hybrid beds have a characteristic stratigraphic and spatial distribution, {{being associated with}} bed successions which generally coarsen and thicken-upward reflecting deposition {{on the fringes of}} lobes in a dominantly progradational system. Using a detailed characterization of bed types, including grain size, grain-fabric and mineralogical analyses, a process-model for flow evolution is developed. This is explored using a numerical suspension capacity model for radially spreading and decelerating turbidity currents. The new model shows how decelerating sediment suspensions can reach a critical suspension capacity threshold beyond which grains are not supported by fluid turbulence. Sand and silt particles, settling together with <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay,</b> may form low yield strength cohesive flows; development of these higher concentration lower boundary layer flows inhibits transfer of turbulent kinetic energy into the upper parts of the flow ultimately resulting in catastrophic loss of turbulence and collapse of {{the upper part of the}} flow. Advection distances of the now transitional to laminar flow are relatively long (several kilometres) suggesting relatively slow dewatering (several hours) of the low yield strength flows. The catastrophic loss of turbulence accounts for the presence of such beds in other fine-grained systems without invoking external controls or large-scale flow partitioning and also explains the abrupt pinch-out of all divisions of these sandstones. Estimation of the point of flow transformation is a useful tool in the prediction of heterogeneity distribution in subsurface systems...|$|E
40|$|A field {{campaign}} {{was set up}} {{as part of the}} LOIS-RACS coastal program (1994 - 1996), to identify the near-bed physical processes responsible for suspended sediment movement in shallow water (10 - 20 m depth) off the Holdemess coast, NE England. A new benthic tripod system Boundary Layer Intelligent Sensor System (BLISS) has been developed and deployed along a transect at three sites, normal to the coastline at Tunstall. Measurements of current velocity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), pressure and CTD were recorded at 5 Hz for 17 minutes every hour, on the same data acquisition system. Results are presented for the summer, July 1995 and winter, February, 1996 deployments over two weeks. Results show that variation in the SSC signal is due to the advection of spatial gradients of SSC by the tidal flows and to the resuspension of sediment from the seabed. Alongshore advection is identified through a strong negative correlation between SSC and salinity, associated with the movement of low salinity, high turbidity water associated with the Humber plume to the south. Resuspension occurs predominantly during storms, when the influence of waves increases the friction velocity at the seabed (determined from measured turbulence spectra) above a threshold value. The threshold friction velocity in February 1996 was found to be approximately 0. 023 ms'', consistent with a partially consolidated fine sediment seabed. In July 1995, a much lower threshold velocity of 0. 008 ms ' was measured and suggests that an unconsolidated layer of fine sediment can be deposited between the mild summer storms. After a winter storm, the decay time of the elevated SSC is consistent with a sediment settling velocity in the range (1. 8 - 2. 8) x 10 "* ms"', a value which is associated with fine silt or <b>flocculated</b> <b>clay</b> particles. Sediment transport during the summer storms in July 1995 was onshore and is due to skewed shoaling waves suspending sediment during the shore-ward phase of the wave, as the wave crest passes. Offshore sediment transport dominated the February 1996 storms, and was due to a steady nearbed offshore flow explained by Stokes theory whereby a net flow {{in the direction of the}} wave advance near the surface will be balanced by a net flow in the opposite direction at depth. Sediment flux transport from waves along accounted for - 10 % of the total flux transported offshore.

The variation of physical and engineering properties of the layers from base to top and along the Bahmanshir River is investigated in this research. The engineering properties of the beds seem {{to be affected by}} tidal and river flow currents and totally by their formation sedimentary environments. Links of the geotechnical data with geological features as formation sources in the upstream of the basin, the cementation due to the capillary feature in the floodplain sub-environment and the <b>flocculated</b> texture of <b>clays</b> in the brackish water, have been discussed in this paper. Overall, it is observed that the geotechnical data could be correlated with the geological features of the Bahmanshir Series...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of clay suspended particles {{is one of}} main factors increasing turbidity in water. Flocculation is a common technique used to eliminate suspended materials from water. Currently, a variety of flocculating agents have been found as commercial products and applied to purify water. Most of agents works well and bring positive effects on environment. However, the use of some agents has shown problems relating to economic benefits and environment. The treatment cost and environmental safety evoke the increasing interests in not only developing countries but also in developed countries. To solve these problems, many researches {{have been carried out}} in the past decades focusing on improving materials for treatment. As a following tendency, the present study aims to understand mineralogy of the laterite samples located in different areas in Viet Nam and investigate their use as <b>flocculating</b> agents for <b>clay</b> suspended particle removal. Three laterite samples were collected to use for experiments in this study. The laterite sample collected in Thach That region (1 –TT) performed the best flocculation efficiency followed by the laterite sample collected in Hoa Lac region (2 –HL). The sample collected in Quynh Tam commune (3 –HL) worked less efficiently than the other two samples. Geothite and hematite are considered to be the main components that are responsible for flocculation action. The study also suggested that the presence of clay sized quarts has an adverse effect on flocculation action...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the use of ferric nitrate as a coagulant to study flocculation kinetics including the fundamental mechanisms of orthokinetic flocculation, the impact of low water temperature, and the effect of sulfate ion. The kinetics of flocculation was studied for systems of kaolin dispersions destabilized by ferric nitrate coagulant in an 18 liter batch reactor under tightly controlled treatment conditions. Detailed measurement of the flocculation kinetics was done by assessing the rate of changes in total particle number concentration with an Automatic Image Analysis (AIA) system and by measuring the degree of turbidity fluctuation in a flowing suspension by a Photometric Dispersion Analysis (PDA) instrument;The overall objective of this research was (1) to investigate the kinetics of <b>flocculating</b> kaolin <b>clay</b> in water suspension under a number of treatment conditions, (2) to assess the effect of temperature on flocculation kinetics, spanning the full range of coagulation domains including the A/D and sweep floc mechanisms of coagulation, and (3) to investigate the role of sulfate ion in flocculation kinetics at two different temperatures;The conclusions of the flocculation kinetics studies using the 18 liter batch reactor are as follows: (1) Both the particle size distribution data obtained from the AIA and the on-line measurement of turbidity fluctuation by the PDA provided reliable and sensitive indications of flocculation kinetics. The AIA at high magnification gave the best indication of the primary particle disappearance, whereas, the PDA ratio values gave the best indication of the larger floc formation. (2) Sulfate ion added to the kaolin suspension {{played an important role in}} the flocculation process, not only in improving flocculation kinetics at more acidic pH levels at warm and cold water temperatures, but also in changing the surface charge of the particles. (3) Low water temperature had the pronounced effect on flocculation kinetics, slowing the rate of flocculation and enhancing the charge neutralizing ability of Fe(III) coagulant. The detrimental effect on the rate of flocculation was especially evident in the formation of larger aggregates as revealed by the PDA analysis. (4) The use of constant pOH at 5 ∘C and/or added sulfate ion was found to be partially effective for reducing the impact of low temperature on flocculation kinetics, but only in the acidic pH range studied (pH 6. 0 to 6. 8), but even under optimal adjustment of these provisions, the flocculation kinetics did not match the room temperature kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradable starch-polyester polymer {{composites}} {{are useful}} in many applications ranging from numerous packaging end-uses to tissue engineering. However the amount of starch that can form composites with polyesters without significant property deterioration is typically less than 25 % because of thermodynamic incompatibility between the two polymers. A reactive extrusion process was developed in which approximately 60 % by weight of plasticized starch was blended with a biodegradable polyester (polycaprolactone, PCL) resulting in tough nanocomposite blends with elongational properties approaching that of 100 % PCL. During the extrusion process, starch was cross-linked with polycaprolactone {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide and montmorillonite (MMT) organoclay, thus compatibilizing the two polymers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the mechanical properties of reactively extruded starch-PCL nanocomposite blends, study changes in the morphology of polymer-polymer interface, monitor dispersion of organoclay in the polymer matrix, quantify the effects of reactive extrusion on polymer glass transition, develop a rheological model and scale up the reactive extrusion process from a batch type micro-extruder to continuous twin-screw extruder. Starch and PCL (36 - 39 wt% each), glycerol (18 - 19 wt%), MMT organoclay (3 - 9 wt%), hydrogen peroxide (0. 067 ml/g starch) and ferrous sulfate catalyst (0. 0025 g/g starch) were extruded in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder at 120 C and injection molded at 150 C. Elongational properties of reactively extruded starch-PCL nanocomposite blends approached that of 100 % PCL at 3 and 6 wt% organoclay. Strength and modulus remained the same as starch-PCL composites prepared from simple physical mixing (non-reactive extrusion). X-ray diffraction results showed mainly intercalated <b>flocculated</b> behavior of <b>clay</b> at 3, 6, and 9 wt% organoclay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that there was improved starch-PCL interfacial adhesion in reactively extruded blends than in non-reactive starch-PCL composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed changes in primary alpha- transition temperatures for both the starch and PCL fractions, reflecting cross-linking changes in the nanocomposite blends at different organoclay content. Starch-PCL reactive blends were more pseudoplastic than 100 % PCL and showed typical shear-thinning behavior and lower shear viscosities than non-reactive starch-PCL composites. Results from scale-up studies indicated that screw configuration, screw speed and feed rates were important process variables that affected material properties. These were optimized to obtain mechanical properties equivalent to those from the micro-extruder. USDA-National Research Initiativ...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable waste {{management}} involves the {{reuse of waste}} {{in ways that are}} both economically- and environmentally-beneficial. Sustainable {{waste management}} encompasses a wide range of disciplines and applications and is increasingly important today in reducing the disposal of wastes in landfills. This study identified two areas where new knowledge was required to enhance the sustainability of current waste management systems. First, waste foundry sand, was studied for its potential reuse as a soil amendment and its applicability in growing turfgrass to reduce or prevent the current disposal of foundry sand in landfills. Second, the assessment of compost maturity indices were evaluated to identify those indices that more accurately predicted maturity for a certain type of compost. The proper use of these maturity indices will guarantee higher quality for the end user, increasing compost use and ensuring the completion of this sustainable waste management cycle. ^ To avoid increasing costs of landfill disposal, it has become increasingly important for U. S. foundries to identify beneficial reuses for the 7 - 11 million metric tons of waste foundry sand (WFS) generated annually. A major drawback to the reuse of some WFSs as a soil amendment is the high soil strength they create (measured as strength to rupture of lab-formed clods) under dry conditions, where root growth may be limited. Fifteen WFSs were analyzed for strength to rupture (strength) using lab-formed clods, exchangeable cations (Na, Mg, Ca), metal oxide concentration (Fe, Mn, Al, Si), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and clay content. The results indicate that high strength WFSs have properties similar to hardsetting soils caused by high Na+ clay content and can be ameliorated by the addition of Ca 2 +. From these results it was proposed that the addition of compost may also help reduce the strength caused by sodium bentonite. The humic acids present in a mature compost could potentially <b>flocculate</b> the <b>clay</b> and prevent its dispersion. ^ Indices used to determine the maturity of compost are important because immature compost can adversely affect plant growth if used as a soil amendment due to the presence of undecomposed, phytotoxic compounds and high microbial activity which can scavenge available nutrients. Different indices of compost maturity were assessed for their accuracy in predicting maturity when using a compost with high salt and high pH characteristics. The traditional and best tests, plant bioassays, provided results that were highly variable with time and did not approach any equilibrium for the duration of this study. These results were probably due more to the high salinity and pH than the overall compost maturity. Chemical indices, specifically those related to the optical density and aromaticity (%), proved best for this situation. ^ The high strength properties observed previously in WFS were tested by planting perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in different blends containing WFS mixed with compost, acid-washed sand, or gypsum. Measurements of strength to rupture (strength), shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and surface coverage were performed for each mix and compared to a commercial potting media control. Results determined that strength was not a factor for any of the parameters studied but the K/Na base saturation of WFS:compost mixes was highly correlated with total shoot dry weight for both perennial ryegrass and tall fescue. A compost blend containing 40 % WFS was determined to be the optimal amendment for the reuse of WFS as it incorporated the greatest possible amount of WFS without any observed reduction in turfgrass growth parameters. These results suggest that under certain conditions, strength may not be an important factor in the reuse of WFSs as soil amendments. ^ This study produced knowledge that will improve current waste management strategies for waste foundry sand and compost so that each process is more sustainable. The reduction in costs associated with landfill disposal of waste foundry sand and the better quality assessments for compost will provide economic incentives that will allow for their environmentally-beneficial reuse in the future.

40|$|About 35 % of {{the total}} land area in Australia is {{affected}} by different categories of salt-affected soils. Apart from natural salinity, {{a significant proportion of}} the cultivated land has become saline due to irrigation, particularly where groundwater or recycled waters were used. Sodium salts tend to dominate salt affected soils and groundwater in Australia, therefore sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) are currently used to assess the effects of sodium on soil structure. However, the literature review has identified that the solutions of salt–affected and fresh water or wastewater irrigated soils may contain elevated concentrations of potassium and/or magnesium, which may affect the levels of soluble and exchangeable cations, and lead to soil structural deterioration due to clay dispersion and swelling. Traditional indices SAR and ESP, used for assessing soil structure, do {{not take into account the}} effects of K on soil clay dispersion and swelling. Furthermore, although exchangeable Mg has not been included within the common definition of sodicity, there has been disagreement concerning its influence on the behaviour of sodic soils. In addition, in the SAR model Ca²⁺ is equated to Mg²⁺ in flocculating power. Consequently the use of SAR and ESP, as the indices of soil structural stability, can be misleading when soil structure is negatively affected by the high amount of monovalent K⁺, and the concentration of Mg in soil solution and exchange sites is higher than that of Ca. In the research reported in this thesis, a newly developed concept of CROSS (cation ratio of soil structural stability) has been used, instead of SAR, as an index for assessing soil structural changes affected by different cations in soils. Traditional index SAR is defined as SAR = Na / √(Ca+Mg) / 2 & New index, CROSS is defined as : CROSS = Na+ 0. 56 K / √(Ca+ 0. 6 Mg) / 2 where the concentrations of these ions (Na, K, Ca and Mg) are expressed in milli moles of charge/L. While SAR as a measure of soil structural stability is only applicable to sodium dominant soils, CROSS derived from the ionicity of clay-cation bond is better suited to soils containing multiple cations in various proportions. In contrast to SAR, the differential effects of Na and K in dispersing soil clays and the differential effects of Mg and Ca in <b>flocculating</b> soil <b>clays</b> are considered in the CROSS model. The main objectives of this thesis were to investigate the effects of elevated concentration of K and Mg on soil structure in combination with the other cations, and to assess the applicability of CROSS as an index of structural stability for salt-affected soils by using soils of different clay mineralogy, texture, electrolyte concentration, pH and organic matter. Further, to identify potential ways to manage structural stability of these soils and to improve their physical condition. Studies on pure clay systems have been included to understand the fundamental processes involved in dispersion in soil clays. The primary outcomes of this research were a series of peer reviewed scientific papers, which centred on the following key findings: 1. The deleterious effects of increasing concentration of K on clay dispersion and hydraulic conductivity were confirmed for three soil types of different clay mineralogy, pH EC and organic matter. Non- destructive X-ray CT scanning provided a means of measuring changes in soil porosity and pore connectivity. 2. The ionicity indices of the cations Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺, and Ba²⁺ were theoretically derived using their ionisation potentials and charge. The behaviour of two pure clays (illite and bentonite) and two soil clays in aqueous suspension was investigated. As the ionicity index decreased in the following order Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺ > Mg²⁺ >Ca²⁺ > Sr²⁺ > Ba²⁺ the tendency to covalency increased and, hence, the predisposition to break the clay-cation bonds in water decreased. Strong and significant relationships between ionicity indices of cations in clay–cation bonds and clay behaviour such as dispersivity (r²= 0. 93) and zeta potential (r²= 0. 84) confirm that the degree of ionicity in these bonds dictates the water interaction with clay particles, leading to their separation from the clay aggregates. The strong relationships between zeta potential and the degree of dispersivity (r²= 0. 78) suggests that surface charge on clays is responsible for the variations in correlations between ionicity indices and clay behaviour among the four types of clays. 3. Effects of clay-cation bonding on soil structure were further validated by non destructive X-ray computed tomography (μCT) scanning of the cation treated soil samples. Changes in pore architecture as influenced by the proportion of cations (Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) bonded to soil particles were characterised. All the structural parameters, studied by μCT scanning, were highly correlated with the ionicity indices of dominant cations, confirming that the structural changes during soil-water interaction depend on the ionicity of clay cation bonding. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of cation treated soils dominated by a single cation were dependant on the observed structural parameters, and were significantly correlated with active porosity (r²= 0. 76) and pore connectivity (r²= 0. 97) characterised by μCT scan. 4. Applicability of CROSS as a new index of soil structural stability was methodically validated and confirmed in series of studies for a range of soils containing varying quantities of Na, K, Mg, and Ca. The effects of CROSS were highly dependent on the total electrolyte, soil texture, clay mineralogy, pH and organic matter content. 5. Useful threshold values of the electrolyte concentration required to flocculate the dispersed suspension were derived. Threshold electrolyte concentration (TEC) of the flocculated suspensions of three soils were significantly correlated with CROSS of the dispersed suspensions (r²= 0. 93). Again, when the individual soil type was considered, smectitic clay with high negative charge had lower TEC than the illitic or kaolinitic <b>clay.</b> The cationic <b>flocculating</b> charge of the flocculated suspensions (CFC), which incorporate the individual flocculating power of the cations, was significantly correlated with CROSS. However, these types of relationships will depend on several factors even within the given soil class. Therefore, the dispersive potential (Pdis) of the individual soil was derived, from which the required amount of the cationic amendments can be calculated to maintain flocculated soils and their structural integrity. 6. The research results presented within this thesis clearly demonstrate that clay dispersion influenced by CROSS values depends on the unique association of soil components affecting the net charge (measured as negative zeta potential) available for clay-water interaction, rather than the charge attributed to the clay mineralogy and/or organic matter. Soil with smectitic mineralogy and high cation exchange capacity dispersed less than soils dominant in illitic and kaolinitic clays. In successive experiments, soils differing in clay mineralogy, organic carbon and pH were treated with solutions of varying CROSS, NaOH and sodium hexa- meta phosphate (calgon) respectively. Where the high organic carbon of the soil was bonding with clay surface, the charge was reduced considerably. Treating this soil with NaOH led to the dissolution of organic carbon and increased the pH, thereby increasing the net charge and clay dispersion. The treatment with calgon did not dissolve the organic carbon or increase the pH. Nevertheless, the attachment of hexa-meta phosphate with six negative charges on each molecule greatly increased the negative zeta potential and clay dispersion. A high correlation (r²= 72) was obtained between the dispersed clay content and zeta potential of all soils with different treatments confirming that the net charge on the soil surface available for water interaction controls the dispersion-flocculation phenomena. The research outcomes presented in this thesis have significantly contributed to theoretical and practical knowledge concerning the effects of cations in soils and irrigation waters on soil structure. The new structural stability index, CROSS, validated in this thesis, provides a far more comprehensive assessment of the structural stability of soils affected by salinity, naturally or due to different quality of irrigation waters, than the traditionally used indices such as sodium adsorption ration (SAR), monovalent cation ratio (MCAR) or potassium adsorption ratio (PAR). Furthermore, CROSS provides an accurate and more suitable guideline for the use of irrigation water of different cation composition (e. g. recycled water), which enables management decisions on the suitability and the rate of irrigation water. The dispersive potential for individual soils, derived in this research, will facilitate calculation of the required cationic amendments to maintain flocculated soils and their structural integrity.
