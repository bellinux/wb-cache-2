5|$|In 1912, Willamette {{renamed the}} {{building}} {{in honor of the}} Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built. Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall while school was on break for Christmas. This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact. The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire. The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square tower topping the structure. Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall. A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of Waller, plus completing the new Lausanne Hall and adding a central <b>heating</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central <b>heating</b> <b>plant.</b> Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{feasibility}} study and market review of small scale bioenergy <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> in the Russian North-West region.

40|$|RCR Energy Systems builds {{industrial}} <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> {{and their}} control systems. In these the excess air (above the stoichiometric ratio) for combustion {{is a process}} variable and its setpoint is determined using a look-up table. RCR aims to improve the efficiency of wood-fired, thermal-oil <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> by {{using a combination of}} carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen trim control to automatically adjust the excess air setpoint. <b>Heating</b> <b>plants</b> require the correct amount of oxygen for combustion. Too little excess air does not allow complete combustion, producing a loss in efficiency and wasted fuel. Too much excess air reduces the flame temperature with a consequent drop in heat transfer rate and loss of efficiency. The aim of the project was to explore the advantages of carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen trim control, as well as its application, design and implementation in trimming excess oxygen setpoint, to a lower, but still safe operating level. Various carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen trim control schemes were researched with the most suitable being implemented on an industrial system using a combined carbon monoxide and oxygen measurement analysers. This scheme was then tested on the <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> at Hyne & Son in Tumbarumba, Australia. The tests proved that the excess air setpoint could be successfully reduced by 2 %, leading to an approximate 3 – 5 % improvement in efficiency...|$|R
