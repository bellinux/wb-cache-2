5000|$|... service/warranty testing, {{focusing}} on identifying a failed or marginal <b>field-replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> (FRU). Note that service/warranty is typically focused solely on hardware and its internal firmware, as most software-related {{issues can be}} resolved by an end-user {{with the assistance of}} a technical support agent over the phone.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the type}} of grip used in the cable cars of San Francisco. The grip is {{attached}} to the lead truck of the car (or both trucks, in the case of double-ended cars), and is a <b>field-replaceable</b> <b>unit.</b> While there have also been side grips and even top grips, the sheer number of rope changes, crossings, and [...] "let-go" [...] curves make a bottom grip, i.e., one in which the jaws open directly downward, the most practical type of grip.|$|E
50|$|A <b>field-replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> (FRU) is {{a printed}} circuit board, part, or {{assembly}} that can be quickly and easily removed from a computer or other piece of electronic equipment, and replaced by the user or a technician without having to send the entire product or system to a repair facility. FRUs allow a technician lacking in-depth product knowledge to isolate faults and replace faulty components. The granularity of FRUs in a system impacts {{total cost of ownership}} and support, including the costs of stocking spare parts, where spares are deployed to meet repair time goals, how diagnostic tools are designed and implemented, levels of training for field personnel, whether end-users can do their own FRU replacement, etc.|$|E
50|$|Industrialization {{has seen}} the {{widespread}} growth of commercial manufacturing enterprises, such as the automotive industry, and later, the computer industry. The resulting complex systems have evolved modular support infrastructures, with the reliance on auto parts in the automotive industry, and replaceable computer modules known as <b>field-replaceable</b> <b>units</b> (FRUs).|$|R
40|$|Wired test {{structures}} exhibit many unwanted dependencies: They typically use hierarchical and daisy-chained wiring, {{and they}} share interconnects and backplanes {{with the system}} under test. As a result, faults can easily lead to incomplete or erroneous test reports on properly working components. Wireless test structures do not have these shortcomings and, thus, allow for more accurate testing and diagnosing. Wireless communication further allows for non-intrusive testing that does not require any cabling or physical access to the system under test. We describe two prototype implementations: a wireless <b>field-replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> ID and a wireless version of the popular JTAG standard. 1...|$|E
