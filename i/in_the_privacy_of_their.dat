25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes, {{people are}} more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends {{on a number of}} considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people are}} often nude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home or garden, either alone or {{with members of the}} family; naturists {{normally}} refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.|$|E

Debye, {{interviewed in}} 2006 at age 89 recollects {{that his father}} was {{completely}} apolitical and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home politics were never discussed. According to his son, Debye just wanted to do his job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute {{and as long as the}} Nazis did not bother him was able to do so. He recalls that his mother urged him (the son) to stay in the US in the event of war. Debye's son had come to the US on a planned 2-month vacation during the summer of 1939 and never returned to Germany because war did, indeed, break out.|$|E

25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued {{that the government had}} a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E

2500|$|An anti-pornography {{movement}} has {{existed in the}} United States since before the 1969 Supreme Court decision of Stanley v.

This led President Lyndon B. Johnson, {{with the backing of}} Congress, to appoint a commission to study pornography.

[...] After the suit was brought, the school district, of which the two high schools are part, revealed that it had secretly snapped more than 66,000 images. [...] The suit charged that in doing so the district infringed on its students' privacy rights. [...] A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the school district to stop its secret webcam monitoring, and ordered the district to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees.|$|E

2500|$|Oral sex {{has long}} had a special {{criminal}} status in Georgia law; until 1998, oral sex even {{between husband and wife}} was punishable with up to 20 years in prison. [...] The United States Supreme Court, in 1986, [...] originally upheld Georgia's anti-sodomy law (which covered both oral sex and anal sex) as constitutional even when applied to criminalize two consenting adults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bedroom (Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 176). [...] Twelve years later, Georgia's Supreme Court would, however, find that the same law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court was unconstitutional on state constitutional grounds, at least as applied to oral sex with persons over the age of consent (Powell v. Georgia, S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18 (1998)).|$|E

But, a chance invitation and visit to a Tupperware party at an East London flat in 1981 changed everything– Jacqueline saw the potential of selling sexy lingerie and sex toys to women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own homes. Jacqueline launched the Ann Summers Party Plan– a home marketing plan for sex toys, with a strict [...] "no men allowed" [...] policy. This type of party, which provides women with a forum to meet and talk about sex (and other matters), became so popular that such parties are now regarded as part of British popular culture; this format also provides the company with a convenient way of circumventing legal restrictions about displaying sex toys for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Kobold beliefs {{represent}} {{the survival of}} pagan customs into the Christian and modern eras and offer hints of how pagan Europeans worshipped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes. Religion historian Otto Schrader has suggested that kobold beliefs derive from the pagan tradition of worshipping household deities thought to reside in the hearth fire. Alternatively, Nancy Arrowsmith and George Moorse {{have said that the}} earliest kobolds were thought to be tree spirits. According to 13th-century German poet Conrad of Würzburg, medieval Germans carved kobolds from boxwood and wax and put them [...] "up in the room for fun". Mandrake root was another material used. People believed that the wild kobold remained in the material used to carve the figure. These kobold effigies were 30 to 60cm (one to two feet) high and had colourful clothing and large mouths. One example, known as the monoloke, was made from white wax and wore a blue shirt and black velvet vest. The 17th century expression to laugh like a kobold may refer to these dolls with their mouths wide open, and it may mean [...] "to laugh loud and heartily". These kobold effigies were stored in glass and wooden containers. German mythologist Jacob Grimm has traced the custom to Roman times and has argued that religious authorities tolerated it even after the Germans had been Christianised.|$|E
2500|$|Mousquetaire gloves have buttons at {{the wrist}} so the wearer {{could open the}} buttons and slip her hand out without taking the whole glove off. The finger section would be folded in and kept away tidily. This is how ladies wore gloves while dining. After the meal they would put their hands back into the gloves, usually {{for the rest of}} the evening. During the 19th century, {{especially}} from the mid-Victorian era onwards, gloves were tailored so as to fit very tightly onto the hands and armsso tightly, in fact, that it was often necessary to use aids such as talcum powder and buttonhooks to put on one's gloves; therefore, it was considered somewhat uncouth to put on or remove one's gloves completely in public and women would make sure to don their gloves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> homes before going out to some event (another reason for the popularity of the mousquetaire opening). The mousquetaire opening/fastening for women's long gloves seems to have become most popular during the Victorian era; during the Napoleonic/Regency period, women's long gloves were often tailored to fit loosely on the wearer's arm, and were often worn gathered below the elbow or held up on the biceps with a garter-like strap. (In the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice, Rosamund Pike and several other actresses wear opera-length gloves with drawstring ties at the top of the glove, but this might not be an accurate representation of the style of long gloves in the Regency era; fashion plates from the period do not appear to show gloves with drawstring-type ties, but do often show women wearing gloves held up by garterlike straps or ribbons.) ...|$|E
