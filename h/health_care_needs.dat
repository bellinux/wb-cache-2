Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} bivariate semiparametric index {{models as}} a tool for modelling the interplay of socioeconomic and health characteristics in determining <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilisation. These models allow for a fully nonparametric relationship between socioeconomic status, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> and <b>care</b> utilisation. The only parametric restriction imposed is that multiple socioeconomic and health indicators can be aggregated into two distinct indices that measure the broader concepts of socioeconomic status and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need,</b> respectively. We demonstrate the usefulness of this class of models based on an illustrative empirical example. The estimations highlight complex interactions of socioeconomic status and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> in determining <b>care</b> use, which may be difficult to grasp via standard parametric modelling approaches. ...|$|R
50|$|A special <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> {{patient can}} be defined as a person with physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioural, cognitive, {{emotional}} impairment which may be congenital, developmental, or acquired through disease, trauma, or environmental cause. This condition may hinder the patients’ daily routine activities. It may impact their oral and general health. The example of special <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> patients are individuals suffering from compromised immunity such as Leukemia, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, cardiac conditions associated with Endocarditis. Furthermore, individuals with the disorders of orofacial complex such as Amelogenesis imperfecta, Dentinogenesis imperfecta, Cleft lip/palate, oral cancer and a like, are also considered as special <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> patients. These individuals <b>need</b> special oral <b>health</b> <b>care</b> which is required for their disease management.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} interplay of {{socioeconomic}} and medical determinants of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilization among elderly Europeans from ten countries. Using novel strictly comparable cross-national data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the study exploits recent semi- and nonparametric estimation methods to illustrate how individual socioeconomic status and <b>health</b> determine <b>health</b> <b>care</b> utilization in different institutional settings. Our flexible estimation method allows {{for the use of}} multiple health measures to adjust for individual differences in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> without sacrificing cross-national comparability of the resulting estimates. Within countries, we find only a small, if any, socioeconomic gradient. Moreover, all health systems appear to be reasonably responsive to differences in <b>care</b> <b>need.</b> At the same time, we find considerable variation in treatment intensity across countries, which we cannot fully explain by differences in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, {{geographic}} information systems employing spatial data {{are being used}} to identify communities with poorer <b>health</b> <b>care</b> status. Since <b>health</b> <b>care</b> indicators are strongly linked to income, could these data, usually based on adult indicators, be used for pediatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need?</b> We hypothesized that individual-level indicators such as quality of life scales (QOL) would be better than community-level indicators at identifying families with poorer <b>health</b> <b>care</b> practices. Surveys and medical record reviews were used for a sample of 174 caregivers of young children. Lower level of income was associated with poorer scores on several QOL domains, and on the primary health practices (i. e., non-urgent emergency room use and lack of age-appropriate immunization status). One community-level indicator, the medically underserved area (MUA), was almost as good as the best individual-level indicators at predicting primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> practices.

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>needs.</b> Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years.

25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>needs</b> of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

40|$|Needs-based <b>health</b> <b>care</b> funding {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} being considered for the Canadian <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, particularly {{as a basis for}} allocating funds from central Ministries of Health to local and regional health authorities. Standardized Mortality Ratios are one of the commonly used measures of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> within such funding formulae. This paper applies the non-linear least-squares method suggested by Bedard et al. (2000) to identify the empirical relationship between standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>need</b> in Ontario. The data used in this analysis allow for a more detailed examination of the SMR-need relationship. Like Bedard et al., we find the SMR-need relationship is highly non-linear; unlike Bedard et al., we find the relationship to be less-than-proportional, reversing the conclusion that needs-based formula based on the linearity assumption under-compensate high-need regions and overcompensate low-need regions. We also find that estimates derived from provider-based expenditure series are especially sensitive to alternative model specifications. Finally, needs-based funding would generate substantial inter-regional reallocations of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> resources in Ontario compared to the current funding methods. ...|$|R
