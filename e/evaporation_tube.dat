40|$|Euro 5 / 6 {{light-duty}} vehicle emissions regulation introduced non-volatile {{particle number}} emission measurements. The particle number measurement system {{consists of a}} volatile removal unit followed by a particle number counter with a 50 % cut-point diameter at 23 nm. The volatile removal unit must achieve a > 99 % concentration reduction of a monodisperse aerosol of tetracontane (CH 3 (CH 2) 38 CH 3) particles of diameter = 30 nm with inlet concentration = 104 cm- 3. In this paper the evaporation of tetracontane particles in the volatile removal unit is investigated theoretically. The temperature and the residence time in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> are discussed, {{as well as the}} possibility of nucleation events of evaporated particles at the exit of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube.</b> In addition, sulfuric acid nucleation at the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> exit is analyzed. Theoretical calculations are, finally, compared to experimental data. Our main conclusion is that the volatile removal efficiency requirements of the legislation can be easily met. However, as some experimental measurements showed, the removal efficiency might differ for large particle sizes and high concentrations; thus, the results of particle number counters with a 50 % cut-point diameter less than 23 nm should be interpreted with care.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of an ongoing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) {{programme}} (‘SAMPLE’). The effects of gas stream flow regimes in the sample transport line and dilution strategies for removal of the volatile fraction on measured PM size distribution are evaluated behind a simulated aero-derivative gas turbine exhaust using a fast mobility DMS 500 particle sizer. The PM size distribution and concentration within the primary transport sample was found to be relatively insensitive to flow regime, with conditions of turbulent flow (lowest residence time) providing the highest number concentrations, and hence least losses. However, given the natural variation of PM production from the combustor source the statistical certainty of these observations require consolidation. A ‘bespoke’ volatile particle removal system based on the European automotive PMP protocol was constructed to allow the effects of dilution ratio and <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> residence time to be investigated. It was shown that both strategies of increasing dilution ratio and residence times in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> did not affect the size distribution at the two distinct nucleation and accumulation modes to any statistical certainty.

40|$|Vacuum {{evaporation}} {{is widely}} used in the dairy industry to concentrate the products before spray drying. The mineral fraction undergoes strong modifications and it {{is involved in the}} fouling of evaporator surface at increasing concentrations and temperature. In order to identify the composition of the fouling deposit, the behavior of the mineral fraction was studied during the concentration by evaporation of by-products of the manufacture of fresh cheeses and acid casein, lactic acid whey and hydrochloric acid whey respectively. These latter have the same pH (about 4. 6) and are strongly mineralized, but differ from their mineral composition: lactic acid whey contains a high level of lactic acid but no citrate ion whereas hydrochloric acid whey contains citrate ion and no lactic acid. Concentration of both wheys was performed using a pilot-scale falling-film evaporator. Concentrates at different concentration factors (up to 6) were prepared and their mineral composition were determined experimentally. Total and soluble concentrations were compared to the theoretical values obtained by multiplying the concentration factor and the initial concentrations in the raw materials. The composition of the precipitates formed in the concentrates and on the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> was then deduced. The behavior of the mineral fraction of both acid wheys during evaporation was shown very different. The concentration of lactic acid whey did not lead to the formation of mineral precipitate of calcium phosphate or other salts. On the contrary, precipitation of calcium citrate occurred into the concentrate during the concentration of hydrochloric acid whey. Moreover, losses of citrate and calcium in the concentrates were deduced, suggesting calcium citrate deposit {{on the surface of the}} <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes.</b> This study underlines the key-role of citrate ion in the fouling of evaporators during the concentration of acid whey.

Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) submicron structures were grown on lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrates via the thermal evaporation of MoO 3 nanopowder at 750 °C in a horizontal tube furnace. A mixture of 90 % argon and 10 % oxygen was introduced into the thermal <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> at flow rate of 1 L/min.

The legislation {{was extended to}} include gasoline direct injection (G-DI) vehicles since 2014 and will be applied to non-road mobile machinery. Target {{of this paper was}} to investigate whether existing PN measurement equipment are capable of measuring below 23 nm. More specifically, it was investigated 1) whether all volatile particles can be removed efficiently in the PN measurement systems 2) whether any artifacts happen in the PN systems (e. g. formation of non-volatile particles due to pyrolysis), and 3) whether by lowering the lower size the measurement uncertainty increases significantly. The main conclusions are: 1) The volatiles are not always removed efficiently in the PN measurement systems. The major issue is re-nucleation of sulfuric acid downstream of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube.</b> These particles typically do not grow at sizes above 23 nm. 2) There are indications of formation of 10 nm solid particles from hydrocarbons and sulfuric acid in the PN systems. 3) The measurement uncertainty due to differences between commercial systems will increase.

Then an experimental study of falling film evaporation was carried out in order to validate the mathematical model. A series of parameters, such as velocity, film thickness and concentration, etc., were obtained from the mathematical model. The calculated results show that the average velocity and the film thickness change sharp at the entrance region when x 100 mm. The film thickness depends largely on the flow rate of solution.

40|$|As the {{legislation}} on vehicle emissions {{is becoming more}} and more stringent, increasing attention has been paid to the fine particles emitted by diesel and gasoline vehicles. The high number emission of fine particles has been shown to have a large impact on the atmospheric environment and human health. Researchers have shown that gasoline engines, especially Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines, tend to emit large amounts of small size particles compared to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline engines and diesel engines fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). As a result, the particle number emissions of GDI engines will be restricted by the EU 6 legislation. The particulate emission level of GDI engines means that they would face some challenges in meeting the EU 6 requirement. This thesis undertakes research in the following area. Firstly, the filtration efficiencies of glass fibre filters were quantified using a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer 500 (DMS 500) to see if all of the particles from the sampled gas can be collected by the filters. Secondly, various valve timings and different injection modes such as double injection with a second injection after compression, single early injection and split early injection were implemented to measure the Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and combustion characteristics of a GDI engine under warm-up operating conditions. Thirdly, the techniques for removing volatile particles were investigated using a catalytic Volatile Particle Remover (VPR) and an <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Tube</b> (ET) with hot air dilution under various test conditions. The results show that for the glass fibre filters tested here, the transmission efficiencies of the particles are very low, indicating that PM sampling using fibre filters is an effective method of studying the particulate emissions from the engine. Particle number emissions using double injection with injection after compression were much higher than those with single injection during the intake stroke. Under 1200 rpm, 110 Nm cold engine operation, no reduction effect on PM emissions was shown by using split intake injection to further facilitate homogeneous mixture formation compared with single intake injection. Valve timings showed moderate effects on particulate emissions. Properly adjusted timing for exhaust valve closure led to reduced particulate emissions by a factor of about 2 and the combustion characteristics were not adversely affected much. The VPR temperature and exhaust residence time did not show much effect on the catalytic VPR performance once the mass flow rate of exhaust was above 0. 09 g/s. Generally, the transmission efficiencies of the VPR follow the trends of the scaled PMP counting efficiency specification. Hot air dilution is effective in reducing the small size particles. At 23 nm, the transmission efficiencies are within the error range of the PMP specification. The catalytic VPR and the <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Tube</b> were all found to be effective in reducing the particle number of small size (nucleation mode) particles. Both systems have some particle loss mainly due to the physical effects of diffusion and thermophoresis. Until now, GDI engines have not been optimised for reducing particulate emissions as the focus has been on gaseous emissions and fuel economy. With careful re-optimisation of the catalyst light-off and engine calibration (especially for transients) then there is scope for GDI engines to meet forthcoming emissions legislation.

40|$|A solid {{particle}} number limit {{was applied to}} the European legislation for diesel vehicles in 2011. Extension to gasoline direct injection vehicles raised concerns because many studies found particles below the lower size limit of the method (23 nm). Here we investigated experimentally the feasibility of lowering this size. A nano condensation nucleus counter system (nCNC) (d 50 % = 1. 3 nm) was used in parallel with condensation particle counters (CPCs) (d 50 % = 3 nm, 10 nm and 23 nm) at various sampling systems based on ejector or rotating disk diluters and having thermal pre-treatment systems consisting of <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> or catalytic strippers. An engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) measured the particle size distributions. Depending on the losses and thermal pre-treatment of the sampling system, differences of up to 150 % could be seen on the final detected particle concentrations when including the particles smaller than 23 nm in diameter. A volatile artefact as particles with diameters below 10 nm was at times observed during the cold start measurements of a 2 -stroke moped. The diesel vehicles equipped with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) had a low solid sub- 23 nm particles fraction (< 20 %), the gasoline with direct injection vehicles had higher (35 – 50 %), the gasoline vehicles with port fuel injection and the two mopeds (two and four-stroke) had the majority of particles below 23 nm. The size distributions peaked at 60 – 80 nm for the DPF equipped vehicles, at 40 – 90 nm for the gasoline vehicles with a separate nucleation mode peak at approximately 10 nm sometimes.

40|$|By early 2006, {{all major}} {{manufacturers}} of light-duty Diesel vehicles were marketing models equipped with Diesel particulate filters (DPFs). This paper focuses on Particulate Matter (PM) emissions by mass {{and number of}} a representative light-duty Diesel vehicle equipped with a DPF and employing a fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) to aid regeneration. PM emissions and solid particle numbers according to the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) proposals and regulated gaseous emissions were acquired throughout testing. According to the PMP recommendations, a particle number counter was employed downstream of an <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> sampling from the CVS to measure solid particles. In addition, an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) connected directly to the CVS was used to give real time number and size distributions, both volatile and nanoparticles. The effect of cold start (at 23 °C) is discussed, especially for particle number emissions. Low temperature start (- 7 °C) gave increased gaseous emissions but resulted in small changes in PM and number concentration compared to the 23 °C tests. The paper focuses on particle emissions changes in response to types of regenerations. Real time size distributions show nucleation mode evolution during regeneration events. When the vehicle speed changes during active DPF regenerations a second nucleation mode peak may appear due {{to changes in the}} oxidation process of the deposited material in the DPF. NEDC emissions of total solid and volatile particles during regenerating cycles are two orders of magnitude higher than those from non regenerating cycles. However, non-volatile particle emissions levels observed from regenerating cycles stay at the same order as non-regenerating cycles. Differences between emissions before and after regeneration are discussed for both PM mass and number. Based on NEDC emissions and two regeneration events during the 3000 km tests conducted, vehicle stabilization distances are proposed. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
40|$|As diesel PM {{regulation}} {{gets more}} stringent, the current gravimetric method {{which has been}} used for legal determination of PM mass for vehicle emissions will have difficulty accurately quantifying PM mass emissions. Progress in regulating diesel PM emissions by non-gravimetric means has been made in the Europe. The method, so called particle measurement program (PMP) protocol specifies counting solid particles larger than 23 nm. This method has already been adopted for Euro V and VI to regulate light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emissions and it is also expected to be adopted to regulate emissions for aviation section. However, exclusion of sub- 23 nm particles poses some potential issues. In this thesis, the PMP method was investigated with a focus on finding the nature of sub- 23 nm particles which are excluded in the current PMP protocol. A PMP-compliant system, an AVL advanced particle counter (APC) and an alternative volatile particle removal system, a catalytic stripper (CS) were evaluated and compared for measuring solid particle number emissions in chapters 2 and 3. The evaluations and comparisons were conducted using sulfuric acid and hydrocarbon particles as model volatile particles in laboratory tests, and diluted exhaust from a diesel particle filter (DPF) -equipped heavy-duty diesel vehicle operated on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer under steady speed conditions at two different engine loads. Thisstudy also compared particulate matter (PM) mass and particle number (PN) emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions, including two uphill (phases 1 and 2) and two downhill (phases 3 and 4) segments. The UDDS and on-road flow-of-traffic tests represent a broader engine operating conditions than those currently certified emissions testing cycles. For the laboratory test, both the APC and CS removed more than 99 % of the volatile particles in terms of PN when using aerosols composed of pure sulfuric acid or hydrocarbons. When using laboratory test aerosols consisting of mixtures of sulfuric acidand hydrocarbons more than 99 % of the particles were removed by the APC but the surviving particles were no longer entirely volatile, with 12 - 14 % being solid. For the chassis dynamometer test, PN emissions of particles between 3 and 10 nm downstream of the APC were 2 and 7 times higher than the PN emissions of particles above 10 nm at the 74 and 26 % engine load, respectively. At the 26 % engine load, PNlevel of the 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were significantly higher than that in the dilution tunnel, demonstrating that the APC was making 3 to 10 nm particles. The PN emissions of 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were related to theheating temperature of the APC <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube,</b> suggesting these particles are artifacts formed by renucleation of semivolatiles. Considerably fewer particles between 3 to 10 nm were seen downstream of the CS for both engine loads due mainly to removal of semivolatile material by the catalytic substrates, although some of this difference could be attributed to diffusion and thermophoretic losses. Chapter 4 provides an evaluation of the nature of sub 23 nm particles downstream of the European PMP methodology with prescribed cycles and on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured using two PMP measurement systems in parallel. For this analysis, {{the focus is on the}} real-time results from multiple instruments. The results revealed that a significant fraction of particles downstream of both PMP systems for all tested cycles werebelow 11 nm. The fraction of sub 11 nm particles observed downstream of the PMP system decreased when the overall dilution ratio of one PMP system was increased from 300 to 1500, suggesting those sub 11 nm particles were formed through re-nucleation of semivolatile precursors. When the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> temperature was increased from 300 to 500 °C, no difference in particle number concentrations was observed, suggesting incomplete evaporation of semivolatile particles did not contribute to those sub 11 nm particles. Particle emissions were about one order of magnitude higher during flow-of-traffic driving along a highway with a steep grade than during the prescribed driving cycles. During the same flow-of-traffic condition, a sudden jump of PMP operationally defined solid particle concentration was observed, while the accumulation mode particle concentrations in the constant volume sampling (CVS) tunnel measured by engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) only showed a slight increase. This discrepancy was attributed to the extensive growth of the re-nucleated particles downstream of the PMP systems. In chapter 5, the PMP system was evaluated over a standard laboratory testing cycle and uphill and downhill on-road, flow-of-traffic driving conditions. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower than the U. S. 2007 heavy-duty PM mass standard. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the uphill and downhill driving on-road driving conditions. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS and downhill on-road driving conditions were 3 times lower than the Euro VI heavy-duty PN limit for transient cycles, while the PN emissions from the uphill on-road driving conditions were 4 to 5 times higher than the Euro VI PN limit. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS (with an average engine load of 38 %) were comparable in magnitude to those for the phase 3 downhill segment (with an aveage engine load of 40 %) of the on-road test, and were 25 % lower than those for the phase 4 downhill segment (with an avearage engine load of 18 %) of the on-road test. The variability of the PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nmranged from 10 to 40 % for the UDDS and on-road tests, comparable to that found in the European PMP study...|$|E

Milk from Nestle farmers is analyzed to check its quality, if everything is correct the milk undergoes thermization, which consists of a heat treatment to reduce the microbial flora for further storage in silos. Milk is standardized and is treated in the evaporator, which aims {{to reduce the amount}} of water. In the dairy industry, the evaporation is used to concentrate products like milk, skimmed milk and dairy whey. It is also used as a preliminary treatment before drying. Dissolved solids in milk do not evaporate, so there is an increase of the concentration in the liquid phase. To perform this operation triple effect falling film evaporator plus a finisher is used. The objective of this project is to increase the evaporator capability. There are several points to improve: i) Increase the mass flow treated for each product, in the case of condensed milk from 7. 500 L/h to 8. 000 L/h and in products like 1 % milk Sveltesse and 26 % milk from 7. 800 L/h up to 8. 000 L/h. ii) Reduce the time required for sterilizations. iii) Optimization of operating conditions. However, this objective is subjected to the following restriction: the quality of the product, measured as the amount of total solids at the evaporator outlet, a theoretical 75 % for condensed milk and 44 % to 1 % and 26 % milk respectively, has to be maintained. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) methodology, used by Six Sigma, is used systematically in the company Nestle to solve problems appearing during operation. DMAIC methodology is divided into five stages that are solved iteratively. Therefore, this is the methodology employed in the present work. It has been observed and reported that the overall efficiency and production is improved due to automation. So, control loops, process sequences or valves and pumps operation have been modified in this work. The main result of the project has been achieved because the capability of the evaporator has been increased, so now it can be operating 350 hours more. This is due to an increase in the flow of the products to 8. 000 L/h and because the sterilization time has been reduced at an average of 47, 3 minutes for sterilization. Savings in water consumption have been also obtained, corresponding to 114, 5 m 3 /yr due to reduced sterilizations and 1. 260 m 3 per year in the automation, which represents 1. 374, 5 m 3 /yr. An increase in the temperature of the separator finisher has been achieved up to an average of 52 °C, which allows, together with the enhancement in the milk distribution into the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> due to the increment of flow, a reduction in the pressure of the thermocompressor about 0, 5 bar.

40|$|Calculation of {{evaporation}} requires accurate thermophysical {{properties of}} the liquid. Such data are well-known for conventional fossil fuels. In contrast, e. g., thermal conductivity or dynamic viscosity of the fuel vapor are rarely available for modern liquid fuels. To overcome this problem, molecular models can be used. Currently, the measurement-based properties of n-heptane and diesel oil are compared with estimated values, using the state-of-the-art molecular models to derive the temperature-dependent material properties. Then their effect on droplet evaporation was evaluated. The critical parameters were liquid density, latent heat of vaporization, boiling temperature, and vapor thermal conductivity where the estimation affected the evaporation time notably. Besides a general sensitivity analysis, evaporation modeling in a practical burner ended up with similar results. By calculating droplet motion, the evaporation number, the evaporation-to-residence time ratio can be derived. An empirical cumulative distribution function {{is used for the}} spray of the analyzed burner to evaluate evaporation in the mixing <b>tube.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> number did not exceed 0. 4, meaning a full evaporation prior to reaching the burner lip in all cases.

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} <b>tubes.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R

Three cooking replications were conducted. Three cooked unbroken rice grains were subjected to a two-cycle compression test using a TA.XT-Plus Texture Analyser equipped with a cylindrical probe (Ø[*]=[*] 35  mm, Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Surry, UK). The texture profile resulting from this two-compression test is composed of two sets of one positive and one negative curves, which {{can be divided into}} regions that represent downstrokes (increasing values) and upstrokes (decreasing values) (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2). Hardness (HRD, the peak of the first positive curve), adhesiveness (ADH, the area under the negative curve, representing the work required to pull the plunger from the sample on the base plate), cohesiveness (COH, the ratio of the area of the second positive curve to that of the first positive curve), and springiness (SPR, the ratio of the time elapsed from the upstroke to the peak in the second curve (T 2) to the time elapsed from starting point to the peak of the first curve (T 1), representing sample height recovery after the initial compression) [Lyon et al. 2000].

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to evaluate convective condensation and evaporation of R 22, R 32 and R 410 A inside a smooth tube (inner diameter 11. 43 mm), a herringbone tube (fin root diameter 11. 43 mm) and a newly developed enhanced surface EHT tube (inner diameter 11. 5 mm) at low mass fluxes. The inner surface of the EHT tube is enhanced by dimple/protrusion and secondary petal arrays. For condensation, the heat transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is 2. 0 - 3. 0 times larger than a smooth tube and the EHT tube is 1. 3 - 1. 95 {{times that of the}} smooth tube. The heat transfer enhancement ratios of the herringbone tube and the EHT tube are larger than their respective inner surface area ratios. Mass flux has a non-monotonic relation with the condensation heat transfer coefficient in the herringbone microfin tubes; this was especially evident for R 32 and R 410 A. For <b>evaporation,</b> the EHT <b>tube</b> provides the best evaporation heat transfer performance for all the three refrigerants; this is mainly due to the heat transfer enhancement produced from the larger number of nucleation sites, increased interfacial turbulence, boundary layer disruption, flow separation and secondary flow generation caused by the dimple and petal arrays. The evaporation heat transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is only slightly higher than that of the smooth tube. Overall, the EHT tube provides increased heat transfer enhancement for both condensation and evaporation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceQuantifying {{water flow}} across larger {{areas of the}} vadose zone has {{applications}} in water resources management and climate modeling. The nonlinearity of unsaturated flow and the variability of vadose zone parameters make it difficult, if not impossible, to accurately simulate near-surface water content and flux with large-scale models. Monte Carlo simulations of one-dimensional infiltration and evaporation were conducted with the Richards equation to simulate moisture content and flux in a heterogeneous field according to the streamtube concept. A set of 126 retention curves and saturated hydraulic conductivities from the UNSODA database was used to generate random fields of hydraulic parameters with pre-defined auto- and cross-correlation. Two stochastic parameters were used: the retention shape factor, ln mn, and either the retention scale parameter θs or ln hG or the saturated hydraulic conductivity, ln Ks. Infiltration is mostly governed by ln Ks. The evaporative flux is strongly determined by the “structural” parameter ln hG and also by the “textural” parameter ln mn. The water content in {{the upper part of}} the soil depends mostly on ln mn and somewhat on θs. Cross-correlations all resulted in clusters with consistently low or high water contents and moisture fluxes. Aggregation to obtain results at larger scales was done by a posteriori averaging of local results. This procedure is a convenient benchmark for large-scale modeling approaches. In an example of a priori aggregation, effective retention parameters were optimized to synthetic retention curves for the larger pixel scale and subsequently used in the Richards equation. The amount of infiltrated water was overestimated by up to 40 %, large parts of the upper profile were erroneously predicted to be saturated. Although effective hydraulic properties have been used successfully in evaporation studies, considerable errors, which increased with pixel size, also occurred for <b>evaporation.</b> The stream <b>tube</b> modeling offers a convenient and accurate, albeit mundane, approach to elucidate the role of hydraulic properties and to obtain large-scale hydrological data...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexities}} of two-phase flow and <b>evaporation</b> on a <b>tube</b> bundle present important {{problems in the}} design of heat exchangers and the understanding of the physical phenomena taking place. The development of structured surfaces to enhance boiling heat transfer and thus reduce the size of evaporators adds another level of complexity to the modeling of such heat exchangers. Horizontal falling film evaporators have the potential to be widely used in large refrigeration systems and heat pumps, in the petrochemical industry and for sea water desalination units, but {{there is a need to}} improve the understanding of falling film evaporation mechanisms to provide accurate thermal design methods. The characterization of the effect of enhanced surfaces on the boiling phenomena occurring in falling film evaporators is thus expected to increase and optimize the performance of a tube bundle. In this work, the existing LTCM falling film facility was modified and instrumented to perform falling film evaporation measurements on single tube row and a small tube bundle. Four types of tubes were tested including: a plain tube, an enhanced condensing tube (Gewa-C+LW) and two enhanced boiling tubes (Turbo-EDE 2 and Gewa-B 4) to extend the existing database. The current investigation includes results for two refrigerants, R 134 a and R 236 fa, at a saturation temperature of Tsat = 5  °C, liquid film Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 3000, at heat fluxes between 20 and 60 kW/m 2 in pool boiling and falling film configurations. Measurements of the local heat transfer coefficient were obtained and utilized to improve the current prediction methods. Finally, the understanding of the physical phenomena governing the falling film evaporation of liquid refrigerants has been improved. Furthermore, a method for predicting the onset of dry patch formation has been developed and a local heat transfer prediction method for falling film evaporation based on a large experimental database has been proposed. These represent significant improvements for the design of falling film evaporators...|$|R
40|$|The high ozone {{depletion}} {{and global warming}} potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction. Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside <b>tubes</b> and <b>evaporation</b> off sprayed <b>tubes.</b> For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC- 113, CFC- 11, HCFC- 123, HFC- 134 a and HC- 601. The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any fluorocarbon refrigerant there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40 % gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC- 123 in a flooded evaporator with HC- 601 / 602 [90. 4 / 9. 6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43 % will increase the coefficient of performance by 4. 5 % at the same cooling capacity. The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13. 7 % promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation...|$|R
40|$|In this Doctoral Thesis a {{study was}} carried out to examine the field of {{applications}} of Evaporative Light Scattering Detector in HPLC systems in food and pharmaceutical Analysis. In food analysis, carbohydrates in honeys and oil triglycerides profile were examined and in pharmaceutical analysis, the determination of clarithromycin {{was carried out}}. ELSD is a quasi-universal detector suitable for the determination {{of a number of}} analytes. The main steps of the detector operation are: a. The eluent from the HPLC column is nebulized into a fine mist of droplets; b. The mobile phase solvent is evaporized using a heated <b>evaporation</b> (drift) <b>tube,</b> at a low temperature; c. The remaining solute molecules, assisted by gas supported focusing (GSF), pass through an optical beam and light scattering is measured. Although this type of detection is related to the scattering mechanism, for a number of applications the chromatographic peak area can be related to the concentration of the analytes. One of the main advantages of the use of ELSD detection is its ability for quantification of the analyte without the time consuming sample treatment or derivatisation step. Both procedures are common for the most used UV-vis detectors. For the chromatographic determination of sugars in honey, fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose were determined with reversed phase HPLC. The mobile phase used consisted of time gradient of acetonitrile/water with initial ratio 90 / 10 % v/v to final ratio 82, 5 / 17, 5 % v/v. Sugars solutions were prepared with proper dissolution in water. Calibration curves were linear with a range of 6 - 600 mg/L, the detection limits being 2. 64 mg/L for fructose, 2. 17 for glucose, 1. 90 mg/L for sucrose and 1. 82 mg/L for maltose. The method developed was applied for the determination of the aforementioned sugars in honey samples. The samples were injected in the chromatographic system, after dissolution in water. The sugar content was calculated using standard additions plot or the normalization procedure of the areas of the chromatographic peaks. This method was also utilized for the determination of adulteration in honeys with sucrose. For the quality examination of olive oils a reversed phase HPLC chromatographic system with a time gradient mobile phase of acetonitrile/ water was developed. The oils under examination were injected to the chromatographic system simply after proper dilution with acetone, which renders this method especially fast and simple. The triglyceride peaks were identified using reference 238 chromatograms obtained in the same conditions (column, mobile phase). The data obtained were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). From the results of the training and control sets of oils it was revealed that there was a significant trend of grouping of the olive oils compared to other seed oils. This behavior can be used for the adulteration control in olive oils, because the adulterated olive oils appeared as outliers in the PCA plot. Further to this adulterated olive oils showed a significant increase of some characteristic chromatographic peaks, such as ECN 42. In the field of pharmaceutical analysis, ELS-Detector was used for the first time for the development of an HPLC method for the determination of the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin. Isocratic reversed phase HPLC approach was developed using a C- 18 column (Waters Spherisorb 5 μm ODS 2, 4. 6 x 250 mm) and a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile / aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and formic acid as pairing reagents. Experimental parameters (temperature of heated drift tube, flow rate of mobile phase, gas flow rate, mobile phase composition) were optimized. Using the optimized conditions the working range was 10 - 100 mg/L (upper limit can be increased considerably), with a detection limit of 4. 5 mg/L (6 x 10 - 6 M). The retention time is 4. 7 min. The method was successfully applied for the content assay of clarithromycin formulations. ...|$|R
40|$|Two-phase flow of {{gases and}} liquids or vapors and liquids in pipes, channels, equipment, etc. is {{frequently}} encountered in industry {{and has been}} studied intensively for many years. The reliable prediction of pressure drop in two-phase flow is thereby an important aim. Because {{of the complexity of}} these types of flow, empirical or semiempirical relationships are only of limited reliability and pressure drops predicted using leading methods may differ by up to 100 %. In order to improve prediction methods, this work presents an experimental and analytical investigation of two-phase pressure drops during <b>evaporation</b> in horizontal <b>tubes.</b> The goal of the experimental part was to obtain accurate two-phase pressure drop values over a wide range of experimental conditions. The existing LTCM intube refrigerant test loop has been modified and adapted to the new test conditions and measurement methods. Two new test sections have been also implemented into the modified test rig. The new test section consists of two zones: diabatic and adiabatic. This configuration allows tests to be run that obtain experimental two-phase pressure drop values under diabatic and adiabatic conditions simultaneously. The experimental campaign acquired 2543 experimental two-phase pressure drop values. Based on a comprehensive state-of-the-art review and comparison with two-phase frictional pressure drop prediction methods, it is proven that none of these methods were able to accurately, reliably predict the present experimental values. In the second part of this work, an analytical study was undertaken in order to develop a new two-phase frictional prediction method. It has been shown in the literature that the so called "phenomenological approach" tends to provide more accurate and realistic predictions as the interfacial structure between the phases is taken into account. Based on that, a phenomenological flow pattern approach was chosen in the present study. The recent Wojtan-Ursenbacher-Thome [155] map was chosen to provide the corresponding interfacial structure. The new model treats each flow regime (i. e. interfacial structure) separately and then ensures a smooth transition in between, being in agreement with the experimental observations. Another important feature of the proposed model is that it matches the correct limits at x = 0 (single-phase liquid flow) and x = 1 (single-phase gas flow). Based on a statistically comparison, it is concluded that the new two-phase frictional pressure drop model based on flow pattern map successfully predicts the new experimental data. The present work completes the fourth basic step in LTCM's flow pattern based work on two-phase flow and heat transfer inside horizontal round tubes: (i) generalized flow pattern map, (ii) flow boiling heat transfer model, (iii) convective condensation model and (iv) two-phase frictional pressure drop model...|$|R
40|$|The {{substitution}} of CFC refrigerants in refrigeration systems, heat pumps and organic Rankine cycles, requests a good {{knowledge of the}} heat transfer and pressure drop properties of substitute fluids. A contribution to this international effort is proposed with the study of two hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (HFC- 134 a and the zeotropic mixture HFC- 407 C) {{and the study of}} the natural refrigerant ammonia. The HFCs have been experimentally tested on the first test rig developed in the Laboratory of Industrial Energy Systems (LENI) which was substantially modified to cope with ammonia, both in terms of safety requirements and operational conditions. The experimental test section is composed of two concentric tubes, with in <b>tube</b> <b>evaporation</b> of the refrigerant inside the inner tube of counter-current Annular water heating. A new database of the local heat transfer coefficients for the refrigerants HFC- 134 a, HFC- 407 C and ammonia together with pressure drop measurements has been collected and used to define and calibrate a new and more general heat transfer model. The two HFC refrigerants have been tested on the test rig developed by Kattan [36]; due to the chemical and the thermophysical properties of ammonia, a new test rig has been designed for the ammonia tests and a new calculation procedure based on the mean temperature measurement on the tube wall has been used. The experimental database covers evaporation tests on plain and on microfin tubes, and with nominal oil concentrations varying from 0 to 5 [%] (by wt.). Detailed modeling is concentrated on the tests on plain tube without oil. Each of the three refrigerants has been evaporated at 4 [°C]. The other experimental conditions for the HFCs refrigerants were an inside tube diameter of 10. 92 [mm], a heat flux range of 2 – 5 [kW/m 2] and three mass velocities of G = 100, 200, 300 [kg/(m 2 s) ] visualized as Stratified-Wavy flows (G = 100 [kg/(m 2 s) ]), and mainly Annular for the higher mass velocities (G = 200, 300 [kg/(m 2 s) ]). The other global conditions for ammonia were an internal tube diameter of 14. 00 [mm], a heat flux range of 5 – 70 [kW/m 2] and eleven mass velocities of G = 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 80, 120, 140 [kg/(m 2 s) ], corresponding to Stratified, Stratified-Wavy, Intermittent and Annular flow patterns; complementary tests, varying the mass velocity at constant vapor qualities (x = 20, 50, 80 [%]), have been made in particular to better characterize boundaries between flow patterns. The flow patterns are visualized through glass sections {{at both ends of the}} 3. 1 [m] long test tube. An extensive review of void fraction models with sensitivity analysis on the actual available flow pattern map has been made. From the 17 correlations reviewed, the models of Taitel-Dukler [71] and Rouhani [79] have been used. Other improvements to the threshold criteria of the Stratified-Wavy to Annular transition, lead to an accurate diabatic map to predict the flow patterns and their transition for very different families of fluids like HFC's and ammonia. A new approach in the prediction of two-phase flow heat transfer has been proposed through the study of each flow pattern separately, according to a new criterion defining the onset of nucleate boiling as a function of the critical convective heat transfer coefficient representative of the location where nucleate boiling might occur. A function based on a pseudo Biot number allows, from the mean heat flux around the tube periphery, to base the model on two different mean heat fluxes applied respectively to the parts of the perimeter in contact with the liquid and the vapor in stratified types of flow. Considering pure convective heat transfer, or mixed convective and nucleate heat transfer, this division allows the use of a common criterion to be applied to each flow pattern. The two-phase flow heat transfer coefficient has finally been obtained as a weighted mean function of the vapor and the liquid heat transfer coefficient with respect to their contact surface with the heated tube. Based on the database of refrigerants HFC- 134 a and ammonia, the standard deviation of the new heat transfer model is of σ = 27. 9 [%]. Even if the database showed that the flow conditions were close to, or in the turbulent to laminar flow transition, and even if the major part of the experimental points were purposely obtained close to the various flow pattern transitions, the new model showed very good agreement with the experimental database. Due to the precision of the new flow pattern map and the effectiveness of the onset on nucleate boiling criterion, this new heat transfer model accurately predicts the heat transfer conditions during evaporation. Finally, a new method to model separated flows is proposed, based on partial hydraulic diameters and a mean interface velocity...|$|R
