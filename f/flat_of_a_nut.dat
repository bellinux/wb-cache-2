50|$|Rice milk {{is mostly}} used for baking {{because of its}} {{especially}} sweet taste, but in case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> or soy allergy a grain milk processed from rice may be preferable.

50|$|Where a {{fastener}} forms its own thread in the component being fastened, {{it is called}} a screw. This is most obviously so when the thread is tapered (i.e. traditional wood screws), precluding the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut,</b> or when <b>a</b> sheet metal screw or other thread-forming screw is used.|$|R
50|$|The minor {{diameter}} is the lower extreme {{diameter of the}} thread. Major diameter minus {{minor diameter}}, divided by two, equals {{the height of the}} thread. The minor diameter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> is its inside diameter. The minor diameter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolt can be measured with go/no-go gauges or, directly, with an optical comparator.|$|R
30|$|More generally, we infer {{things that}} are not {{immediately}} visible: when we see the unbroken shell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut,</b> we expect to find an edible kernel inside; when we see a horse partially obscured by a tree, we expect to see the whole animal when it moves into full view; and so on.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> split <b>nut</b> is <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> that {{is split}} {{lengthwise}} into two pieces (opposed halves) {{so that its}} female thread may be opened and closed over the male thread <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolt or leadscrew. This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> on <b>a</b> screw (in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid is cyclic {{if it is}} <b>a</b> union <b>of</b> circuits. The cyclic <b>flats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid form a lattice under inclusion. We study these lattices {{and explore}} matroids from the {{perspective}} <b>of</b> cyclic <b>flats.</b> In particular, we show that every lattice is isomorphic to the lattice <b>of</b> cyclic <b>flats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> lattice Z <b>of</b> sets and <b>a</b> function r on Z to be the lattice <b>of</b> cyclic <b>flats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> matroid and the restriction of the corresponding rank function to Z. We define cyclic width and show that this concept gives rise to minor-closed, dual-closed classes of matroids, two of which contain only transversal matroids. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Sathers {{distributed}} {{products to the}} five-state Midwest region. The territory grew and product lines and operations changed to include the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> roasting operation in the 1960s. With the addition of telemarketing in 1967, the customer territory expanded to eleven Midwest states. With this increase, Sathers added tractor trailer units to its trucking fleet.|$|R
50|$|The major {{diameter}} of threads is {{the larger of}} two extreme diameters delimiting {{the height of the}} thread profile, as a cross-sectional view is taken in a plane containing the axis of the threads. For a screw, this is its outside diameter (OD). The {{major diameter}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> may not be directly measured, but it may be tested with go/no-go gauges.|$|R

5000|$|The {{defining}} distinction, per Machinery's Handbook, [...] is {{in their}} intended purpose: Bolts are for the assembly of two unthreaded components, with the aid <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut.</b> Screws in contrast are used with components, {{at least one of}} which contains its own internal thread, which even may be formed by the installation of the screw itself. Many threaded fasteners can be described as either screws or bolts, depending on how they are used.|$|R

50|$|A screw is an {{inclined}} plane {{wrapped around a}} nail. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a female thread (internal thread), often in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>an</b> object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.|$|R
