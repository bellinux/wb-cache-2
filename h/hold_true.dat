5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} defines Generalized Unique Game Problem (GUGP), where weights of the edges {{are allowed to}} be negative. Two special types of GUGP are illuminated, GUGP-NWA, where the weights of all edges are negative, and GUGP-PWT(ρ), where the total weight of all edges are {{positive}} and the negative-positive ratio is at most ρ. The author investigates the counterpart of the Unique Game Conjecture on GUGP-PWT(ρ). The author shows that Unique Game Conjecture on GUGP-PWT(1) <b>holds</b> <b>true,</b> and Unique Game Conjecture on GUGP-PWT(1 / 2) <b>holds</b> <b>true,</b> if the 2 -to- 1 Conjecture <b>holds</b> <b>true.</b> The author poses an open problem whether Unique Game Conjecture <b>holds</b> <b>true</b> on GUGP-PWT(ρ) with 0 <ρ< 1.

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E

5|$|The bird's {{head and}} upper body {{typically}} vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially {{on the forehead}} and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the remiges and rectrices (main wing feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It {{has been found that}} at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds. This does not <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the iris is blackish brown. The talons, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink to dark pinkish-grey and the talons are black.|$|E
5|$|When Ibn al-Ashtar {{returned}} to his position, he dismounted and the Umayyads advanced. In command of the Umayyad right wing was al-Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, {{in command of the}} left wing was Umayr ibn al-Hubab, while Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l Kala' al-Himyari led the cavalry. Ubayd Allah marched along with his foot soldiers. As the battle lines became closer, al-Sakuni's right wing assaulted al-Jushami's left wing. Al-Jushami fell, followed by his son Qurrah and their guards. Consequently, Ibn al-Ashtar's left wing was driven back, but under Abdallah ibn Warqa' al-Saluli they collected themselves and joined Ibn al-Ashtar's right wing. Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar directed the right wing under al-Azdi to assault the Umayyads' left wing in the hope that Umayr ibn al-Hubab would <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> to his promise and fall back as agreed. However, Umayr held his ground and fierce fighting ensued.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Euclidean {{algorithm}} led to {{the development}} of new number systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. In 1815, Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published 1801), but only as a method for continued fractions. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory. Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such as unique factorization, would <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind, who used Euclid's algorithm to study algebraic integers, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat's two-square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described below). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of ideals.|$|E

5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could <b>hold</b> <b>true</b> in the real world.|$|E
