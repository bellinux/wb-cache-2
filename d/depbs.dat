50|$|Duty Entitlement Pass Book Scheme {{in short}} <b>DEPB</b> is an export {{incentive}} scheme. Notified on 1/4/1997, the <b>DEPB</b> Scheme consisted of (a) Post-export <b>DEPB</b> and (b) Pre-export <b>DEPB.</b> The pre-export <b>DEPB</b> scheme was abolished w.e.f. 1/4/2000. Under the post-export <b>DEPB,</b> which is issued after exports, the exporter {{is given a}} duty entitlement Pass Book Scheme at a pre-determined credit on the FOB value. The <b>DEPB</b> rates allows import of any items except the items which are otherwise restricted for imports. Items such as Gold Nibs, Gold Pen, Gold watches etc. though covered under the generic description of writing instruments, components of writing instruments and watches are thus not eligible for benefit under the <b>DEPB</b> scheme.|$|R
50|$|<b>DEPB</b> Scheme {{is issued}} only on {{post-export}} basis and pre/export <b>DEPB</b> Scheme has been discontinued.

One {{significant change in}} the new <b>DEPB</b> Scheme is that in terms of Para 4.3.5 of the Exim Policy even excise duty paid in cash on inputs used in the manufacture of export product shall be eligible for brand rate of duty drawback as per rules framed by Department of Revenue which was not mentioned in the earlier <b>DEPB</b> Scheme.|$|R

Genes involved in PHB biosynthesis include those encoding β-ketothiolase (phaA), NADPH-linked acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) reductase (phaB), and PHB synthase (phaC). phaA and phaB are closely linked on the chromosome together with a third gene with identity to a regulator of PHB granule-associated protein, referred to as orf 3. phaC was unlinked to phaA and phaB. Genes involved in PHB degradation include two unlinked genes predicted to encode intracellular PHB depolymerases (depA and <b>depB).</b> These genes show {{a high level of}} identity with each other at both DNA and amino acid levels. In addition, a gene encoding β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (hbd) was identified.

However, the phaA, phaB, and phaC mutants all showed defects in PHB synthesis. Surprisingly, these mutants also showed defects in growth on C 1 and C 2 compounds and, for phaB, these defects were rescued by glyoxylate supplementation.

40|$|PURPOSE This {{technical}} note provides guidance for determiningg species composition when planning the reforestation of BLH wetland restoration sites. BACKGROUND: BLH wetlands are recognized to perform wildlife, water quality, and recreation functions. Significant losses in acreage and the concomitant loss of functions have occurred {{primarily because of}} clearing and drainage for agriculture. Implementation of the 1985 Food Security Act has slowed the loss of BLH acreage, and federal {{programs such as the}} Wetlands Reserve Program have promoted the restoration of flood-prone agricultural land to BLH wetlands. Also, these wet fields provide an excellent option for the mitigation of impacts required by the Clean Water Act amendments. During the planning of a BLH wetland restoration projee ~ observing the regional natural interrelationship between hydrology, soils, and vegetation can serve as a useful guide toward selecting the desirable tree species and matching them to particukm locations. However, agricultural land suitable for BLH wetland restoration may stilI have significant alterations in hydrology and soil physical properties.

30|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are {{well-known}} bacterial-originated polymers {{and serve}} as storage polyesters. In abnormal growth conditions, bacterial cells are committed to PHA [3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and 3 -hydroxyvalerate (PHBV)] production. The 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) used in various medical devices was found to accumulate in several bacteria, e.g., Azotobacter vinelandii and Alcaligenes eutrophus. The use of polyhydroxybutyrate in pharmaceutical practices is due to their bio-acceptance in patients (Bonartsev et al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010 a, b). Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyester and extremely crystalline (> 50 %) in nature. The melting point of polyhydroxybutyrate is high in contrast to polyesters (Averous and Pollet 2012). Polyhydroxybutyrate serves as an energy storage source for microorganisms. Polyhydroxybutyrate and its copolymer (3 -hydroxyvalerate, etc.) are utilized {{in the production of}} degradable plastics (Ohura et al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Premraj and Doble 2005). Kadouri et al. (2002) reported three genes in Azospirillum brasilense strain Sp 7 that are involved in PHB synthesis, i.e., phbA, phbB and phbC genes for β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl coenzyme A reductase and PHB synthase, respectively. Biodegradation of PHA is accomplished by microbiological mineralization and generates CO 2 and H 2 O (Bonartsev et al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010 a, b). Bacterial-originated PHA depolymerases are known, which may help in the breakdown of polymer (polyhydroxyalkanoate). PHA depolymerases are multi-subunit enzymes, and each subunit has a specific property including a signal sequence, substrate-binding domain, catalytic domain and interconnecting domain (fibronectin type III or threonine similar sequence). Instead, the interconnecting domain of PHB depolymerase contains a cadherin-like sequence found in Pseudomonas stutzeri. PHA depolymerases and PHB depolymerases also differ in substrate-binding domains; PHA depolymerases have one domain, while PHB depolymerases have two domains (for a giant substrate). Polymers that contain cyclic or chain (R) oligomers are sensitive to enzymatic (PHB depolymerases) degradation. Alcaligenes faecalis T 1 utilizes the oligomer of 3 -hydroxybutanoate, and their depolymerase activity was also studied (Ohura et al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Premraj and Doble 2005). Degradation of PHB was also done by Ilyobacter delafieldii in the absence of oxygen (Schink et al. 1992; Jirage et al. 2011). During the cell lysis process, PHB granules are released outside and hydrolyzed by extracellular PHB depolymerase. PHB depolymerases are enzymes that initiate the intracellular degradation of PHBs. In addition to other genes (phaY, phaX, phaW), phaZ is known as the first structural gene for PHB degradation and releases the D- 3 -hydroxybutyrate monomer, which can be further oxidized by 3 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the final product assimilated by the TCA cycle (Sharma and Dhingra 2016). Korotkova and Lidstrom (2001) reported the depA and <b>depB</b> genes, which encode PHB depolymerases for PHB degradation. Volova et al. (2010) reported an enhanced biodegradation rate of polymer films under the marine environment (seawater) instead of compact pellets, and Gracilibacillus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. were identified. Similarly, Mabrouk and Sabryb (2001) found that the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. SNG 9 is involved in PHB utilization. Weng et al. (2011) investigated the biodegradability of PHAs (PHB, PHBV) under controlled conditions (composting) and found that the degradation rate decreases with decreasing percentages of HV (40, 20 and 3 %). Oda et al. (1995) reported a Paecilomyces lilacinus fungal isolate and observed the degradation of PHB by secreting PHB depolymerases and glucose/lactose. Aburas (2016) isolated 20 fungal isolates to examine their PHB degradation potential; out of 20 isolates 11 (belonging to Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Alterneria genera) showed the PHB hydrolysis, with Aspergillus oryzae having an optimal PHB degradation potential at 30  °C and pH 6.5 in 1 % PHB containing minimal medium. Foster and Tighe (2005) introduced a new hydrolytic system for PHB degradation that served as an accelerated model (70  °C and pH 10.6) and modified the degradation characteristics.|$|R
