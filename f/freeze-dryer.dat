50|$|There are {{essentially}} {{three categories of}} freeze-dryers: the manifold <b>freeze-dryer,</b> the rotary <b>freeze-dryer</b> and the tray style <b>freeze-dryer.</b> Two components are common to all types of freeze-dryers: a vacuum pump to reduce the ambient gas pressure in a vessel containing the substance to be dried and a condenser to remove the moisture by condensation on a surface cooled to −40 to −80 °C (−40 to −112 °F). The manifold, rotary and tray type freeze-dryers differ in the method by which the dried substance is interfaced with a condenser. In manifold freeze-dryers a short usually circular tube is used to connect multiple containers with the dried product to a condenser. The rotary and tray freeze-dryers have a single large reservoir for the dried substance.|$|E
50|$|Tray style freeze-dryers are {{typically}} {{larger than the}} manifold dryers and are more sophisticated. Tray style freeze-dryers are used to dry a variety of materials. A tray <b>freeze-dryer</b> is used to produce the driest product for long-term storage. A tray <b>freeze-dryer</b> allows the product to be frozen in place and performs both primary (unbound water removal) and secondary (bound water removal) freeze-drying, thus producing the driest possible end-product. Tray freeze-dryers can dry products in bulk or in vials or other containers. When drying in vials, the <b>freeze-dryer</b> is supplied with a stoppering mechanism that allows a stopper to be pressed into place, sealing the vial before it is exposed to the atmosphere. This is used for long-term storage, such as vaccines.|$|E
50|$|Rotary <b>freeze-dryers</b> {{are usually}} used for drying pellets, cubes and other {{pourable}} substances. The rotary dryers have a cylindrical reservoir that is rotated during drying {{to achieve a}} more uniform drying throughout the substance. Tray style <b>freeze-dryers</b> usually have rectangular reservoir with shelves on which products, such as pharmaceutical solutions and tissue extracts, can be placed in trays, vials and other containers.|$|R
50|$|Myhrvold started buying {{equipment}} for the research kitchen in the Intellectual Ventures lab. Much of the equipment was standard cooking equipment, but it also included items such as rotor-stator homogenizers, ultrahigh-pressure homogenizers, <b>freeze-dryers,</b> a 50,000 G centrifuge, ultrasonic baths, and rotary evaporators. The laboratory already included other high-tech and industrial equipment, a 100-ton hydraulic press, a large water-jet cutter, an electrical discharge machine, and automated milling machines.|$|R
50|$|Manifold <b>freeze-dryers</b> {{are usually}} {{used in a}} {{laboratory}} setting when drying liquid substances in small containers and when the product {{will be used in}} a short period of time. A manifold dryer will dry the product to less than 5% moisture content. Without heat, only primary drying (removal of the unbound water) can be achieved. A heater must be added for secondary drying, which will remove the bound water and will produce a lower moisture content.|$|R

50|$|Once {{solidification}} has ended, the frozen, templated ceramic {{is placed}} into a <b>freeze-dryer</b> {{to remove the}} ice crystals. The resulting green body contains anisotropic macropores in an replica of the sublimated ice crystals and micropores found between the ceramic particles in the walls. This structure is often sintered to consolidate the particulate walls and provide strength to the porous material. The porosity left by the sublimation of solvent crystals is typically between 2 - 200 μm.|$|E

It is shown that introduction of innovative production technologies will allow to develop dynamically {{not only to the}} large companies, but also small firms that will create prerequisites for growth of the Russian market of freeze-dryed products. Tendencies of development of the freeze-drying equipment are analysed. Relevance of development of energy saving <b>freeze-dryers</b> is proved The integrated approach to creation of competitive domestic technologies and the equipment for sublimation dehydration of thermolabile products consists in use of the effective combined remedies of a power supply, a process intensification, reduction of specific energy consumption and, as a result, decrease in product cost at achievement of high quality indicators. Advantages of thermoelectric modules as alternative direction to existing vapor-compression and absorbing refrigerating appliances are given. Researches of process of freeze-drying dehydration with use of thermoelectric modules are conducted.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development and}} characterization of thin film thermocouples {{to be used}} as a non-perturbating solution to follow the freeze-drying process of pharmaceutical chemicals. Pharmaceutical chemicals are routinely produced by means of <b>freeze-dryers</b> with excellent results, however the drying process is slow requiring days to complete and this increases the product cost. To optimize the process, reducing the drying time, this must be carried out close to the maximum allowed temperature. A monitoring system able to continuously monitor the product temperature during the drying could greatly reduce the damage risk, but actual sensors are too invasive to permit a reliable measurement and radiation remote systems cannot be used.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is the development of}} a computational tool for investigating condensation processes and equipments with particular attention on <b>freeze-dryers.</b> These condensers in fact are usually operated at very low pressures, making it difficult to experimentally acquire quantitative knowledge of all the variables involved.

40|$|Vial design {{features}} {{can play a}} significant role in heat transfer between the shelf and the product and, consequently, in the final quality of the freeze-dried product. Our objective was to investigate the impact of the variability of some geometrical dimensions of a set of tubing vials commonly used for pharmaceuticals production on the distribution of the vial heat transfer coefficients (Kv) and its potential consequence on product temperature. Sublimation tests were carried out using pure water and 8 combinations of chamber pressure (4 - 50 Pa) and shelf temperature (40 C and 0 C) in 2 <b>freeze-dryers.</b> Kv values were individually determined for 100 vials located in the center of the shelf. Vial bottom curvature depth and contact area between the vial and the shelf were carefully measured for 120 vials and these data were used to calculate Kv distribution due to variability in vial geometry. At low pressures commonly used for sensitive products (below 10 Pa), the vial-shelf contact area appeared crucial for explaining Kv heterogeneity and was found to generate, in our study, a product temperature distribution of approximately 2 C during sublimation. Our approach provides quantitative guidelines for defining vial geometry tolerance specifications and product temperature safety margins...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} characterization of a thin film thermocouple array {{to be used as}} a non-invasive solution to map the temperature distribution inside small vials used for freeze-drying pharmaceutical chemicals. Pharmaceutical chemicals are often produced by means of <b>freeze-dryers</b> with very good results, even though the slowness of drying process may increase the product cost. Increasing the shelf temperature accelerates the drying process, but can increase the risk of melting and damaging the product. This risk could be minimized by following the product temperature evolution during the drying step, by means of a noninvasive measuring system able to perform an in situ continuous monitoring. Actual sensors are too invasive to permit a reliable measurement and in addition their dimension does not allow to employ many sensors in a small volume. This paper {{describes the}} development of a new multi-sensor structure based on an array of thermocouples having nanometric thickness. The thermocouple array can be embedded into the glass wall of a test vial having all the other characteristics equal to the remaining batch thus providing meaningful and reliable results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate a new wireless and battery-free sensor technology for invasive product temperature measurement during freeze-drying. Product temperature is the most critical process parameter in a freeze-drying process, in particular during primary drying. The product temperature over time profile and a precise detection of the endpoint of ice sublimation is crucial for comparison of freeze-drying cycles. Traditionally, thermocouples are used in laboratory scale units whereas resistance thermal detectors are applied in production scale <b>freeze-dryers</b> to evaluate temperature profiles. However, both techniques show demerits with regard to temperature comparability and biased measurements relative to vials without sensors. A new generation of wireless temperature sensors (Temperature Remote Interrogation System, TEMPRIS) were used in this study to investigate for the first time their value when applied to freeze-drying processes. Measurement accuracy, capability of accurate endpoint detection and effect of positioning were delineated by using product runs with sucrose, mannitol and trehalose. Data were compared to measurements with 36 -gauge thermocouples as well as to non-invasive temperature measurement from Manometric Temperature Measurements. The results show that the TEMPRIS temperature profiles were in excellent agreement to thermocouple data when sensors were placed center bottom in a vial. In addition, TEMPRIS sensors revealed more reliable temperature profiles and endpoint indications relative to thermocouple data when vials in edge position were monitored. The {{results of this study suggest}} that TEMPRIS may become a valuable tool for cycle development, scale-up and routine manufacturing in the future...|$|R

40|$|Freeze-drying is a low-pressure, {{low-temperature}} condensation pumping process {{widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} pharmaceuticals for removal of solvents by sublimation. Key performance characteristics of a <b>freeze-dryer</b> condenser are largely dependent on the vapor and ice dynamics in the low-pressure environment. The main objective of this work is to develop a modeling and computational framework for analysis of vapor and ice dynamics in such <b>freeze-dryer</b> condensers. The direct Simulation Monte Carlow (DSMC) technique is applied to model the relevant physical processes that accompany the vapor flow in the condenser chamber. Low-temperature water vapor molecular model is applied in the DSMC solver SMILE to simulate the flowfield structure. The developing ice front is tracked based on the mass flux computed at the nodes of the DSMC surface mesh. Verification of ice accretion simulations has been done by comparison with analytical free-molecular solutions. Simulations of ice buildup on the coils of a laboratory-scale dryer have been compared with experiments. The comparison shows that unsteady simulations are necessary to reproduce experimentally observed icing structures. The DSMC simulations demonstrate that by tailoring the condenser topology to the flow-field structure of the water vapor jet expanding into a low-pressure reservoir, it is possible to significantly increase water vapor removal rates and improve the overall efficiency of freeze-drying process...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{freezing}} step influences lyophilization {{efficiency and}} protein stability. The main {{objective of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} impact on the primary drying stage of an ultrasound controlled ice nucleation technology, compared with usual freezing protocols. Lyophilization cycles involving different freezing protocols (applying a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 °C/min or 0. 2 °C/min, putting vials on a precooled shelf, and controlling nucleation by ultrasounds or by addition of a nucleating agent) were performed in a prototype <b>freeze-dryer.</b> Three protective media including sucrose or maltodextrin and differing by their thermal properties and their ability to preserve a model protein (catalase) were used. The visual aspect of the lyophilized cake, residual water content, and enzymatic activity recovery of catalase were assessed after each lyophilization cycle and after 1 month of storage of the lyophilized product at 4 °C and 25 °C. The freezing protocols allowing increasing nucleation temperature (precooled shelf and controlled nucleation by using ultrasounds or a nucleating agent) induced a faster sublimation step and higher sublimation rate homogeneity. Whatever the composition of the protective medium, applying the ultrasound technology made it possible to decrease the sublimation time by 14 %, compared with the freezing method involving a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 °C/min. Concerning the enzyme activity recovery, the impact of the freezing protocol was observed only for the protective medium involving maltodextrin, a less effective protective agent than sucrose. Higher activity recovery results were obtained after storage when the ultrasound technology or the precooled shelf method was applied. Controlling ice nucleation during the freezing step of the lyophilization process improved the homogeneity of the sublimation rates, which will, in turn, reduce the intervial heterogeneity. The <b>freeze-dryer</b> prototype including the system of controlled nucleation by ultrasounds appears to be a promising tool in accelerating sublimation and improving intrabatch homogeneity. © 2009 American Society of Mechanical Engineer...|$|E
