[...] In [...] "Toilet Tisha", the duo empathizes with suicidal pregnant teenagers. [...] "Ms. Jackson" [...] is dedicated to the mother of a mother of an out of wedlock child, which André 3000 refers to as [...] "the baby's mama's mamas". [...] The song was inspired by his relationship with singer Erykah Badu, the mother of his child, Seven, and serves as an apology to her mother for causing her daughter pain.

500|$|Sega's {{advertising}} positioned the Genesis as {{the cooler}} console, and as its advertising evolved, the company {{coined the term}} [...] "blast processing" [...] (the origin of which is an obscure programming trick on the graphics hardware) to suggest that its processing capabilities were far greater {{than those of the}} SNES. [...] A Sony focus group found that teenage boys would not admit to owning a SNES rather than a Genesis. With the Genesis often outselling the SNES at a ratio of 2:1, Nintendo and Sega both focused heavily on impression management of the market, even going to the point of deception, with Nintendo claiming it had sold more consoles in 1991 than it actually had, and forecasting it would sell 6 million consoles by the end of 1992, while its actual U.S. install base at the end of 1992 was only <b>just</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 4 million units. Due to these tactics, it was difficult to ascertain a clear leader in market share for several years at a time, with Nintendo's dollar share of the U.S. 16-bit market dipping down from 60% at the end of 1992 to 37% at the end of 1993, Sega claiming 55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994, and Donkey Kong Country helping the SNES to outsell the Genesis from 1995 through 1997. According to a 2004 study of NPD sales data that presents year by year charts through 2001, the Sega Genesis was able to maintain its lead over the Super NES in the American 16-bit console market. According to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on revised NPD sales data, the SNES outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.|$|E

2500|$|Maxwell made {{a number}} of {{important}} changes to Augusta National in 1937.

From an elevated tee, the hole required little more than a short iron or wedge for the approach. [...] Maxwell had grand plans to improve the hole, and he implemented them by moving the green in 1937 to its present location—on top of the hill, about 50 yards back from the old site—and transformed it into the toughest hole in Masters Tournament history. Ben Crenshaw referred to Maxwell's work on the 10th hole as [...] "one of the great strokes in golf architecture".

2500|$|One central {{motif of}} OutKast's songwriting is the duality {{of the two}} members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as [...] "the player" [...] and Andre 3000 as [...] "the poet". Big Boi {{generally}} covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, OutKast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the harmonica break on [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using [...] "relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations." [...] OutKast often discusses {{the status of women}} in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music. In Slate, Alex Abramovich praised the duo for [...] " [...] to shy away from the misogyny and violence rap is so often (and not always unjustly) condemned for."

He planned to be the voice of the K.I.T.T. in Universal's Knight Rider, a sequel to the popular 1980s television series. The production featured a Ford Mustang as K.I.T.T. Since Arnett had a previous long standing relationship with competitor automaker General Motors as the voice for GMC Trucks commercials, GM asked Arnett {{to pull out of the}} project. Arnett opted to withdraw from the project and he was replaced by Val Kilmer. Arnett made a commercial cameo for the video game [...] In 2009, he voiced the title character in , a video game developed by Vicious Cycle Games and starred as an out of work former video game protagonist hoping to make a comeback, versus a greedy game executive played by Neil Patrick Harris.
