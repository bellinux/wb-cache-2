25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, <b>eventhough</b> the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E

Similarly, [...] "tell" [...] and [...] "dell" [...] differ inboth the voicing of the initial consonant, and in its aspiration (the/t/ in [...] "tell" [...] is immediately followed by a puff of air, like a short/h/ between the plosive and the vowel).

5000|$|In April 2014, Justice KS Radhakrishnan {{declared}} transgender to be {{the third}} gender in Indian law, in a case brought by the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa) against Union of India and others. The ruling said: Seldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings {{of the members of}} the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body disown their biological sex. Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres, hospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change. Justice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education. He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, [...] "These TGs, <b>eventhough</b> insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights", concluding by declaring that: [...] #Hijras, Eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as [...] "third gender" [...] for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of our Constitution and the laws made by the Parliament and the State Legislature.#Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.

50|$|Due {{to the new}} developments, Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon (Kozhikode Narayanan Nair) {{tries to}} befriend their rival family - Kompara. They {{on the other hand}} were waiting for an {{opportunity}} to take revenge, pretend to offer help, while their real intention was to increase the hatred between Madhavankutty and his uncle as they see Madhavankutty as a threat and can never do anything unless they remain enemies. They also suggest a marriage alliance with Gauri, which Gangadhara Menon approves. Gauri, still in love with Madhavankutty, acts pregnant saying Madhavankutty as the one responsible for it to prevent the marriage. This agitates Gangadhara Menon and under the advice of Nandakumar (from Kompara family), he decides to destroy the lives of Madhavankutty’s sisters, the way he destroyed Gauri's life. Madhavankutty's father learns about the plot and foils them, but it causes the girls and him to end up in the police station. He fails to convince his son about the truth and they become angrier at their father for his behavior. Nandakumar (Saikumar) sees the opportunity and they murder Pillechan. Madhavankutty, <b>eventhough</b> angry at his father’s deeds, does not desert his half sisters and brings them home, much to the dismay of his sisters who have an argument with him and leaves to Ammu's home to stay. Balachandran realizes the seriousness of the situation and asks the girls {{to go back to their}} brother. He also say that whatever he did, was for Madhavankutty to stop sacrificing his life for his sisters and to get him married to his sister who loves him for life. Balachandran goes to find Madhavankutty to apologize, but gets attacked by a gang of thugs under the command of a person, seemingly Madhavankutty, while it actually was Krishnanunni the eldest of Kompara family who framed him. Balachandran survives and thinks Madhavankutty did it, which causes everyone, even Gauri to turn against him. Gangadhara Menon along with the ones from Kompara family goes to finish Madhavankutty once and for all, but learns that he himself was the target and Balachandran was not attacked by Madhavankutty. They try to murder Menon thinking after all that has happened Madhavankutty will not dare rescue him, but to their surprise he shows up to save Menon. Wounded Menon at the hospital tells to the rest of the family about his nephew's innocence. Madhavankutty survives the attack and succeeds in getting rid of the Kompara family from their lives. Losing hope at everything he believes, he decides to leave all behind and go someplace. He does not listen to the apologies or requests of the sisters to stay. He asks Balachandran to take care of the sisters and to find a better person for Gauri as he will never be a good husband for her. He begins to leave while a youngster shows up staring at his sisters leading him to chase the one, indicating that he can't stop being himself and can never leave.|$|E
