5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of an element with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E

25|$|The {{negotiations}} dragged on, and Colonel Zorbas {{lacked the}} political skills {{to keep up}} with the seasoned veterans on the government side. Mavromichalis, in securing passage of a large number of mildly reformist bills, implemented part of the programme demanded by the Military League, this time under threat of an actual military takeover. Thus, the general staff was reorganised and those close to Constantine (such as Ioannis Metaxas) were removed while budget cuts were made in order to finance army modernisation. But his government clearly showed that the old system endured: only Finance Minister Athanasios Eftaxias had reformist ideas. With the revolution running out of steam, the League began to crumble. It was not a real political movement: its ideology and programme lacked coherence; its leaders were popular but unskilled. They were above all soldiers ill at ease outside their barracks. The League had <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> link its corporatist demands to public discontent by using populist and nationalist slogans, but it unsettled the bourgeoisie. Although it saw the necessity of modernising the country, the middle classes feared the drift towards a military dictatorship, considered deleterious to the normal progress of affairs.|$|E

500|$|It is not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> predict {{who will}} develop {{epilepsy}} after TBI {{and who will}} not.

The onset of PTE can occur within a short time of the physical trauma that causes it, or months or years after. [...] People with head trauma may remain at a higher risk for seizures than the general population even decades after the injury. PTE may be caused by several biochemical processes that occur in the brain after trauma, including overexcitation of brain cells and damage to brain tissues by free radicals.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} largely {{neglected}} by the record label, which {{did little to}} no promotion in the US.

Roeser commented later that he did not [...] "think Sony’s ever really <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sell us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us".

500|$|Although it {{had been}} <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> prepare carbon {{monoxide}} since 1776, it was not at first recognised that carbon monoxide poisoning was the mechanism of death and injury from stoves burning carbonaceous fuels. [...] A coroner's inquest into the death in 1838 of James Trickey, a nightwatchman who had spent all night by {{a new type of}} charcoal burning stove in St Michael, Cornhill, concluded that the poison involved was carbonic acid (that is, carbon dioxide) rather than carbon monoxide. [...] Both Bird and Snow gave evidence to the inquest supporting poisoning by carbonic acid. [...] Bird himself started to suffer ill effects while collecting air samples from the floor near the stove. [...] However, the makers of the stove, Harper and Joyce, produced a string of their own expert witnesses, who convinced the jury to decide that death was caused by apoplexy, and that [...] "impure air" [...] was only a contributing factor. [...] Among the unscientific claims made at the inquest by Harper and Joyce were that carbonic gas would rise to the ceiling (in fact it is heavier than air and, according to Bird, would lie in a layer close to the floor, just where the sleeping Trickey's head would rest) and that [...] "deleterious vapour" [...] from the coffins in the vaults had risen into the church. [...] After the inquest Joyce threatened to sue a journal which continued to criticise the stove for its lack of ventilation. [...] In a subsequent clarification, Bird made it clear that any stove burning carbonaceous fuel was dangerous if it did not have a chimney or other means of ventilation. [...] In fact, Trickey had only been placed in the church in the first place at the suggestion of Harper, who was expecting him to give favourable reports of the new stove's performance.Steventon and Mitchell, p. 38 ...|$|E
