6000|$|... "The {{discoveries of}} Voltaic electricity, electromagnetism, and {{magnetic}} electricity, by Volta, OErsted, and Faraday, {{led to the}} invention of electric telegraphy by Wheatstone and others, and to the great manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire, and of the materials required for them. The value of the cargo of the Great Eastern alone in the recent Bombay telegraph expedition was calculated at three millions of pounds sterling. It also led to the employment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic messages, and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its branches by the more rapid means of communication. The discovery of Voltaic electricity further led to the invention of <b>electro-plating,</b> and to the employment {{of a large number}} of persons in that business. [...] The numerous experimental researches on specific heat, latent heat, the tension of vapours, the properties of water, the mechanical effect of heat, etc., resulted in the development of steam-engines, and railways, and the almost endless employments depending upon their construction and use. About a quarter of a million of persons are employed on railways alone in Great Britain. The various original investigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention of photography, and have given employment to thousands of persons who practise that process, or manufacture and prepare the various material and articles required in it. The discovery of chlorine by Scheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching, and to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics, and has given employment to a very large number of our Lancashire operatives. The discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the employment of thousands of printers, by enabling Esparto grass to be bleached and formed into paper for the use of our daily press. The numerous experimental investigations in relation to coal-gas have been the means of extending the use of that substance, and of increasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its manufacture. The discovery of the alkaline metals by Davy, of cyanide of potassium, of nickel, phosphorus, the common acids, and a multitude of other substances, has led to the employment of a whole army of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles of utility. The foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon, and a great many others might be selected from the sciences of physics and chemistry: but those mentioned will suffice. There is not a force of Nature, nor scarcely a material substance that we employ, which has not been the subject of several, and in some cases of numerous, original experimental researches, many of which have resulted, in a greater or less degree, in increasing the employment for workmen and others."

50|$|In 1872 {{the drum}} {{armature}} was devised by Hefner-Alteneck. This machine in a modified form was subsequently {{known as the}} Siemens dynamo. These machines were presently followed by the Schuckert, Gulcher, Fein, Brush, Hochhausen, Edison and the dynamo machines of numerous other inventors. In {{the early days of}} dynamo machine construction the machines were mainly arranged as direct current generators, and perhaps the most important application of such machines at that time was in <b>electro-plating,</b> for which purpose machines of low voltage and large current strength were employed.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} engraving, {{done with a}} sharp point, rather than a {{v-shaped}} burin. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr {{at the edges of}} each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, <b>electro-plating</b> (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.|$|E
50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{attempt to make}} copper clad steel wire {{took place in the}} early 1860s, according to the Copper Clad Handbook, issued by the Duplex Metals Co., Chester, PA {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by <b>electro-plating</b> copper on steel.|$|E

(He, being under 21 when his mother changed her name, had been the only other member of the family to take the surname Lumley-Robinson). During and after the war other hose clip manufacturers started to emerge all over Europe, but Jubilee continued to be successful. The business was finally incorporated on 1 April 1948 as L. Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd. Subsequently, the group grew with Jubilee Components Ltd and Jubilee Clips Ltd being formed to take on the manufacturing processes, alongside L. Robinson & Co (Plating) Ltd, an <b>electro-plating</b> company established in 1968.|$|E
50|$|He also {{discovered}} that induced currents are established in a second closed circuit when the current strength is varied in the first wire, and that {{the direction of the}} current in the secondary circuit is opposite to that in the first circuit. Also that a current is induced in a secondary circuit when another circuit carrying a current is moved to and from the first circuit, and that the approach or withdrawal of a magnet to or from a closed circuit induces momentary currents in the latter. In short, within the space of a few months Faraday discovered by experiment virtually all the laws and facts now known concerning electro-magnetic induction and magneto-electric induction. Upon these discoveries, with scarcely an exception, depends the operation of the telephone, the dynamo machine, and incidental to the dynamo electric machine practically all the gigantic electrical industries of the world, including electric lighting, electric traction, the operation of electric motors for power purposes, and <b>electro-plating,</b> electrotyping, etc.|$|E
50|$|He {{was the son}} of a carpet-weaver, and {{was born}} in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. Here he found {{employment}} in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade Mason carried on for many years the business of <b>electro-plating,</b> copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of dynamo electric machines, voltaic, or primary, batteries were extensively used for <b>electro-plating</b> and in telegraphy. There are two distinct types of voltaic cells, namely, the [...] "open" [...] and the [...] "closed", or [...] "constant", type. The open type in brief is that type which operated on closed circuit becomes, after a short time, polarized; that is, gases are liberated in the cell which settle on the negative plate and establish a resistance that reduces the current strength. After a brief interval of open circuit these gases are eliminated or absorbed and the cell is again ready for operation. Closed circuit cells are those in which the gases in the cells are absorbed as quickly as liberated and hence {{the output of the}} cell is practically uniform. The Leclanché and Daniell cells, respectively, are familiar examples of the [...] "open" [...] and [...] "closed" [...] type of voltaic cell. The [...] "open" [...] cells are used very extensively at present, especially in the dry cell form, and in annunciator and other open circuit signal systems. Batteries of the Daniell or [...] "gravity" [...] type were employed almost generally in the United States and Canada as the source of electromotive force in telegraphy before the dynamo machine became available, and still are largely used for this service or as [...] "local" [...] cells.
