50|$|<b>Immunotoxicology</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as ITOX) is {{the study}} of immune dysfunction resulting from exposure of an organism to a xenobiotic. The immune dysfunction may take the form of immunosuppression or alternatively, allergy, autoimmunity or any number of inflammatory-based diseases or pathologies. Because the immune system plays a critical role in host resistance to disease as well as in normal homeostasis of an organism, identificantion of immunotoxic risk is significant in the protection of human, animal and wildlife health.|$|E
50|$|In the non-adult (embryo, fetus, neonate, juvenile, adolescent) {{this study}} is {{referred}} to as Developmental <b>Immunotoxicology</b> (commonly abbreviated as DIT). For most toxicants examined to date, the developing immune system exhibits a heightened sensitivity compared with that of an adult. For this reason, DIT screening has applications to human, animal and wildlife health protection.Immunotoxicological responses sometimes leads to extreme health conditions, as we know it is an immunodisfunction problem it becomes fatal. Different people give different type of response to a certain drug as it gets interacted with their immune system. Some people show hypersensitivity to a specific drug.|$|E

40|$|Classically, <b>immunotoxicology</b> {{has been}} defined as the study of adverse effect on the immune system {{associated}} with exposure to environmental chemicals, pharmacologic agents, and biologicals. Although a multitude of immune system defects may occur, these can be generally categorized as immunomodulation (immune suppression or potentiation), hypersensitivity (i. e., allergy), and autoimmunity. We present here a brief synopsis of the ontogeny of <b>immunotoxicology</b> as a discipline including methodology currently used in our laboratory, as well as in others, for investigating the immunomodulatory potential of chemicals at the cellular and biochemical level. Additionally, we summarize some studies related to the immunosuppressive effects of one particular compound, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{presents}} a brief survey {{on the state}} of the art in the development and application of biomarkers for <b>immunotoxicology</b> in fish. There are several reasons for developing this field: many fish diseases are related to environmental quality, various environmental pollutants have immunotoxic potential and many fish diseases have an immunological component. As in <b>immunotoxicology</b> in general, in fish this aspect has received ample attention in the recent past. Much benefit has been obtained from progress in related fields of science, such as fish immunology and rodent <b>immunotoxicology.</b> To date there is a broad spectrum of potential biomarkers for <b>immunotoxicology</b> in fish, from which macrophage parameters seem to be most widely used. The application of others and more predictive for specific immunity, such as lymphoid cell parameters is still limited, probably due to practical problems such as lack of experience with conduct, validation and interpretation. Specific problems include the paucity of background data in the case of epidemiological field studies and the important role of other (non-chemical) stress factors in the immune response, and hence the lack of specificity of potential biomarkers. It is concluded that a promising arsenal of biomarkers does exist, but further development and validation are still needed...|$|E

30|$|<b>Immunotoxicology</b> can be most simply {{defined as}} {{the study of the}} adverse effects on the immune system {{resulting}} from occupational, inadvertent, or therapeutic exposure to drugs, environmental chemicals, and, in some instances, biological materials. Studies in animals and humans have indicated that the immune system comprises potential target organs and that damage to this system can be associated with morbidity and even mortality. In this study, the spleen was chosen for understanding <b>immunotoxicology</b> induced by nano-TiO 2 and the contents of Ti in spleen had increased significantly compared with the control group, but in the positive studies, the number of spleen coefficients was lower than other groups by only 14 %. In six studies, three results showed nano-TiO 2 -induced spleen toxicity by different exposure routes (Table  7).|$|E

40|$|Many {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are {{in development}} {{for a wide}} array of indications. Because {{of the nature of the}} product and/or the intended pharmacology, mAbs are assessed for their potential immunomodulation, whether intended or not. Immunomodulation and <b>immunotoxicology</b> (i. e., immunosuppression, immunogenicity, immunostimulation) can be related. The intended immunomodulatory effect of mAbs is the intended pharmacology for clinical efficacy. Exaggerated or prolonged pharmacological activity may, however, result in adverse immunomodulation, leading to unpredictable and unintended <b>immunotoxicology</b> outcomes. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are often considered as the most relevant species to perform preclinical studies for the testing of mAb-induced immunomodulation and immunotoxicity. This chapter focuses on regulatory considerations associated with the testing of mAbs in NHPs, the mAb product and biomanufacturing process characteristics to take into consideration for immunogenicity testing, and the preclinical study designs in adult and juvenile NHPs to monitor immunomodulation.

40|$|To make {{appropriate}} {{regulatory policy}} decisions, the potential social and eco-nomic {{impacts of the}} policy must first be established. For environmental and occu-pational agents, social and economic impacts are derived from animal toxicology and, when available, human studies that serve as the base for risk-benefit analysis (RBA). Because immune function is associated with resistance to infectious disease, developing RBA for data derived from <b>immunotoxicology</b> studies will require deter-mining {{the changes in the}} frequency or severity of infectious disease resulting from an exposure. Fortunately, considerable information is readily available for identify-ing the frequency of infectious diseases in the general population and its social and economic impacts and to assist the risk assessor when conducting RBA for immuno-toxicology endpoints. The following is a brief review describing some issues in using immunotoxicity data when conducting RBA. It presents an economic methodology to determine the economic impacts of infectious diseases to society, sources where these types of information are available, and an example using a specific infectious disease, otitis media.

40|$|Among {{the issues}} dealing with {{identifying}} potential adverse immunologic effects (i. e., suppression, hypersensitivity, or autoimmunity) associated with xenobiotic exposure, general agreement exists among the regulatory and pharmaceutical communities that predictive tests for autoimmunity are in most need {{of development in}} order to improve risk assessment. The estimation of risk (i. e., the probability of a deleterious effect resulting from exposure) involves both the qualitative evaluation of whether a hazard exists and the quantitative evaluation for determining an acceptable level of exposure in humans. Unless adequate human data are available, which is uncommon, this is based on animal studies. Although animal models exist to study autoimmune processes, these models do not readily lend themselves to interpretation in the risk assessment process due, for the most part, to the complexity of autoimmune disease(s), as they are multifactorial and exhibit genetic heterogeneity in humans. To improve the risk assessment process, researchers must develop and validate animal models that not only incorporate mechanistic information into the assessment process but also allow for consideration of potent genetic, physiologic, and environmental influences.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a brief history}} of the development of the field of <b>immunotoxicology</b> from one individual perspective and sep-arates the discussion into five phases: the methods development and validation phase; the compound testing phase; the many meet-ings and organization of the specialty section phase; the mechanis-tic studies phase; and the guidelines phase. During the discussion of each phase, major highlights, accomplishments, contributors and key references are provided. The <b>immunotoxicology</b> guide-lines for the testing of pharmaceutical chemical entities across the three major geographic axes are also presented and compared, along with some of the concerns raised by industry with these guidelines. The mandatory requirement of functional tests repre-sents the major concern and difference between the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) and the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. The scientific basis for the recommendation of the functional tests proposed in the guidance documents based on National Institute of Environmental Health and Safety/National Toxicology Program (NIEHS/NTP) -sponsored studies is described. Experience at Sanofi-Synthelabo, with the test-ing of 29 new chemical drug entities developed across a broad range of therapeutic classes using this testing paradigm and functional tests to define their immunotoxic potential, yielded a low number of compounds (6. 8 %) that produced any abnormal reaction. The two positive compounds might have been anticipated based on their pharmacology...|$|E
30|$|Some other {{assessment}} procedures provide special safety factors {{because of a}} lack of data, e.g. for developmental toxicology or <b>immunotoxicology.</b> Such factors are not conventional in the assessment procedure analogous to the German Drinking Water Ordinance, which may lead to an underestimation of the risk. With respect to the PPARα-agonistic effect of PFC, humans are less sensitive than rats and mice. Monkeys with their lower sensitivity would be a better model for humans in this respect [3]. Rodent data, in contrast, could lead to more cautious human health-based criteria following a procedure analogous to that of the German Drinking Water Ordinance.|$|E

Financial support has been provided by the Canada Research Chair in Environmental <b>Immunotoxicology</b> (Dr. Michel Fournier) and Collège Doctoral International de l'Université européenne de Bretagne. This study was also supported by the INTERREG IV program (DIESE) : 50 % of the Ph. D. grant was obtained by the first author, {{for the development of}} immune markers in ecotoxicology. International audienceA multibiomarker approach was developed on juvenile Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) to evaluate the pertinence of this approach for low-cost screening assessment of the environmental quality of various coastal sites within estuaries. Several biometric indices and biomarkers (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, metallothionein concentration, and immune responses) were investigated on immature and maturing tomcods (≤ 31 months) collected in four environmentally contrasted sites in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE). Simultaneous examination of various age classes provides the opportunity to detect short-term responses in sensitive young-of-the-year fish (e. g., EROD induction) and longer-time effects associated with chronic exposure and bioaccumulation (e. g., metallothionein induction). Principal component analysis was helpful to discriminate between responses possibly related to contaminant exposure (EROD, metallothionein) and responses that could be affected by upstream-downstream gradient (immune response, biometric indices). Measurement of a battery of biomarkers in young tomcods at several sites along the shore of the SLE is a low-cost screening investigation useful to identify hot spots requiring further investigation with chemical analysis and additional reference sites...|$|E

40|$|Recognition that {{xenobiotics}} can impair {{the function}} of the immune system has led to progress in <b>immunotoxicology</b> over the last two decades. Exposure to immunotoxic chemicals in the environment, however, may be expected to result in more subtle forms of immunosuppression that may be difficult to detect, leading to increased incidences of infections such as influenza and common cold. Studies on experimental animals and humans have shown that many environmental chemicals suppress the immune response. Immunotoxic xenobiotics are not restricted to a particular chemical class.

40|$|The {{immune system}} plays {{a crucial role}} in {{maintaining}} health; however, accumulating evidence indicates that this system can be the target for immunotoxic effects caused by a variety of chemicals including the environmental pollutants of polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, pesticides, and heavy metals. Adverse chemical-induced immunomodulation, which is studied within the discipline of <b>immunotoxicology,</b> may be expressed either as immunosuppression/immunodepression or immunoenhancement. The former may be manifested either as decreased resistance to opportunistic viral, bacterial, fungal, and other infectious agents or increased susceptibility to cancer.

40|$|While {{the history}} of <b>immunotoxicology</b> {{research}} involving experimental animals of immature ages dates back over several decades, there exist remarkably little data, to date, directly comparing the impact of developmental status on immunotoxicological risk.

This article frames the issues surrounding developmental immunotoxicological evalua-tions. In particular, the issues introduced include those of potential animal models, strain/genotype selection, gender, age of exposure, and age of assessment. Recent research results involving early exposure to lead (Pb) and other chemicals are discussed to highlight the nature of the decisions that are available and the potential cost±benefit associated with various approaches to evaluation.

40|$|In {{environmental}} <b>immunotoxicology,</b> leucocyte apoptosis and necrosis parameters may constitute pertinent biomarkers of immunological disturbance due {{to their}} modulations by numerous xenobiotics. In an ecotoxicological concern, {{the aim of this}} study was therefore to develop immune-related biomarkers using flow cytometry methodology in the European bullhead, Cottus sp., a current freshwater fish. In this context, spleens of bullhead were interesting due to sampling facilities and to their immune function. After spleen tissue disruption, leucocytes of each organ were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and cells were adjusted to 106 cells. mL- 1. For each leucocyte sample, five aliquots were carried out. With the first aliquot, autofluorescence of cells were detected. YO PROR- 1 (100 uM) and Propidium Iodide (PI, 1. 5 mM) were added in two different aliquots in order to obtain cellular fluorescence parameters indicating the presence of apoptotic and necrotic leucocytes, respectively. Both YO-PROR- 1 and PI were added in a double markedly method. Spleen leucocyte cellular aliquots were also treated with YO-PROR- 1, PI and quinoline alkaloid camptothecin (100 uM) which induce apoptosis. After incubation, cellular analysis were carried out with a CyanTM ADP flow cytometer connected to hypercytRintellicyt (Beckmann Coulter). Apoptotic and necrotic dead cells showed green and red fluorescence, respectively. The camptothecin treated cells presented similar necrotic values and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells than those observed in controls. In consideration of these developments, dead cell apoptosis and necrosis were tested during in vivo controlled-laboratory experiments where European bullheads naturally infected with Saprolegnia sp. and Ichthyophtirius sp. were exposed to 25 micro g. mL- 1 of Copper. This exposure induced a decrease of cellular apoptosis and necrosis in contaminated organisms compared to controls. In conclusion, this work enabled a technical methodology to evaluate fish immune-physiological markers on spleen leucocyte of the sedentary bullhead, Cottus sp. For the assessment of wild fish health, further studies will be undertaken in order to characterize the potential and to validate the interest of these biomarkers in <b>immunotoxicology</b> studies...|$|E
40|$|Chemicals can elicit T-cell-mediated {{diseases}} such as allergic contact dermatitis and adverse drug reactions. Therefore, testing of chemicals, drugs and protein allergens for hazard identification and risk assessment is essential in regulatory toxicology. The seventh amendment of the EU Cosmetics Directive now prohibits the testing of cosmetic ingredients in mice, guinea pigs and other animal species to assess their sensitizing potential. In addition, the EU Chemicals Directive REACh requires the retesting of more than 30, 000 chemicals for different toxicological endpoints, including sensitization, requiring vast numbers of animals.
