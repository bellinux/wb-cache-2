5|$|Girdap's heyday {{was during}} the Balkan Wars and World War I (1912–1918), when it became the leading {{financial}} group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, the Balkan Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap was no exception to that trend.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{weighted}} {{average cost of}} capital is an approach to determining a discount rate. The WACC method determines the subject company's actual cost of capital by calculating the {{weighted average}} of the company's cost of debt and cost of equity. The WACC must {{be applied to the}} subject company's net cash flow to total <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{financial}} management is to maximize or to continually increase shareholder value. Maximizing shareholder value requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on <b>invested</b> <b>capital)</b> will use most of the firm's capital resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on <b>invested</b> <b>capital),</b> managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. Managers must do an analysis to determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's capital resources and cash surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as paying back creditor related debt.|$|E
25|$|One {{week after}} the severe flooding, {{the capital of the}} state was in {{bankruptcy}} in part because flooding has affected various settlements. According to the local Chamber of Commerce, almost 15,000 establishments in downtown Villahermosa suffered losses of 100% in their infrastructure and inventories. This situation might cause a severe recession in the local economy, because many of these business beside having lost all their <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> have obligations with their suppliers, payments delayed with the government and workers' wages.|$|E

25|$|Dudley Docker {{had joined}} the board in 1906 and was {{appointed}} deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become {{the leader of the}} period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA he started merger talks with The Daimler Company Limited of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904 Daimler's profits were 57 per cent and 150 per cent returns on <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders was the apparent stability of BSA.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring by {{the board}} of directors: The board of directors, with its legal {{authority}} to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance. Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management {{on the basis of the}} quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ex ante. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.|$|E

So, in 1910, BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares, but Docker, who negotiated the arrangements, either ignored or failed in his assessment of their consequences for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of his 1819 expedition, Lisa had {{developed}} strong relationships with the Omaha, Ponca, Yankton and Teton Sioux, Mandan and Arikara peoples.

2500|$|After {{relocating}} to Portland, Oregon {{to live in}} a {{city where}} he could bike to work, and enjoy a higher quality of living, he founded the secondary market domain name company SnapNames in 2000. The company specialized in [...] "snapping up" [...] expired domain names, which occurred [...] "all the time", according to King. It took in $7.8 million in <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> and partnered with several of the largest domain name registrars. King was appointed chief operating officer in 2001. He left SnapNames in 2005 to start his next business venture, AboutUs. By 2006, SnapNames was generating gross sales of $49 million. The company sold to California-based Oversee.net in 2007 for $30 million.|$|E
2500|$|Low {{profit margins}} in {{themselves}} do {{not explain the}} deterioration of revenues. To a large extent {{the costs of the}} operation of the VOC had a [...] "fixed" [...] character (military establishments; maintenance of the fleet and such). Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in economies of scale. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the Company's overhead rose in step with the growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> The era of expansion was one of [...] "profitless growth".|$|E
2500|$|The venture, which taught {{people how}} to use Apple II and IBM PCs, earned King $60,000.

[...] King remained enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for eighteen months studying computer science before leaving in 1984 to start Semaphore Inc., a company that sold accounting, billing, and project management software to architecture and engineering firms.

50|$|The American War of Independence {{ended in}} 1783.

2500|$|On January 24, 2006, BNSF {{announced}} a $2.4billion program of infrastructure upgrades for 2006.

In making the announcement, BNSF chairman Matthew K. Rose cited improvements in the company's return on <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> and expressed hope for continued improvement.

2500|$|The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Mexican cinema was peaking in the mid-to-late 1940s, at {{just the}} time Buñuel was {{connecting}} with Dancigers. [...] Movies represented Mexico's third largest industry by 1947, employing 32,000 workers, with 72 film producers who invested 66 million pesos (approximately U.S. $13 million) per year, four active studios with 40 million pesos of <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> and approximately 1,500 theaters throughout the nation, with about 200 in Mexico City alone. [...] For their first project, the two men selected {{what seemed like a}} sure-fire success, Gran Casino, a musical period piece set in Tampico during the boom years of oil exploitation, starring two of the most popular entertainers in Latin America: Libertad Lamarque, an Argentine actress and singer, and Jorge Negrete, a Mexican singer and leading man in [...] "charro" [...] films.
