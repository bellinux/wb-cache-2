25|$|In {{response}} to the internationally recognized environmental crisis of the rapid desiccation of the Aral Sea, the five states sharing the Aral Sea Basin (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) are developing a strategy to end the crisis. The World Bank and agencies of the United Nations (UN) have developed an Aral Sea Program, {{the first stage of}} which is funded by the five countries and external donors. That stage has seven areas of focus, one of which—land and water management in the upper watersheds—is of primary concern to Kyrgyzstan. Among the conditions detrimental to the Aral Sea's environment are erosion from deforestation and overgrazing, contamination from poorly managed irrigation systems, and uncontrolled waste from mining and municipal effluents. Kyrgyzstan's National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Action</b> Plan (NEAP) has addressed these problems as part of its first-phase priorities in cooperation with the Aral Sea Program.|$|E
25|$|Maritime {{interests}} {{argue that}} {{in light of the}} closure of the MRGO, and the loss of the deepwater access it provided to the Gulf of Mexico, modern oceangoing vessels are unable to access the inner harbor of the Industrial Canal, permanently limiting the canal's utility as a site for shipyards and other industry requiring water access. Without a new lock, the port's France Road Container Terminal and Jourdan Road Wharf would also remain closed due to the inadequate deepwater access. Proponents of the new lock additionally cite dwindling barge traffic as evidence that the existing obsolete lock is choking off commerce. Opponents point to the same figures to support their contention that insufficient demand exists to justify the new lock. Neighborhood associations and environmental groups have fought the project and, on October 6, 2006, represented by the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, the Holy Cross Neighborhood Association, the Louisiana <b>Environmental</b> <b>Action</b> Network, and the Gulf Restoration Network obtained an order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana enjoining the project until the Corps complies with the National Environmental Policy Act.|$|E
25|$|Surface and {{groundwater}} in the Barada basin is polluted by industrial and domestic wastewater, {{as well as}} by agricultural non-point sources such as fertilizers and pesticides. Much of the wastewater generated from industrial activities in Greater Damascus is discharged into the environment, mainly to the Barada River, without prior treatment. The uncontrolled disposal of toxic, chemical products, primarily from lead industries and battery manufactories, has also resulted in severe soil pollution. There is no pre-treatment of industrial wastewater discharged into the sewer network. As a result, the largest wastewater treatment plant of Damascus in Adra frequently malfunctions. Measured concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD), a measure of organic water pollution, exceeded the allowed limits in most of the branches of the Barada River. According to the Syrian National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Action</b> Plan of 2003, concentrations of BOD and ammonia in the Barada River exceeded Syrian Standards for 86% of collected samples between 1995 and 2000. Well and spring water in the basin is bacteriologically contaminated because of sewage discharge. The concentrations of nitrates in some wells in the Ghouta exceeded the limits set by the drinking water standards. Because of discharges by tanneries concentrations of Chromium III reach 10mg/liter in Al Daiyani River and exceed the allowable limits tenfold in the wells of Al Zablatini area, all located in the Barada basin. Surface water pollution reduces real estate values next to the river and its branches, as well as the recreational value of the river. It also damages fishery, aquaculture and biodiversity, in addition to its health impacts.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} a study that {{explored}} {{the relationship between the}} local <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> of Healthy Cities programs and the adverse health impacts of climate change. The analysis is primarily based on a limited literature review of climate change and health, with particular attention to the relationships between Healthy Cities and climate change, and on documentary analysis of information from organization reports and website content associated with Healthy Cities programs in Europe and Australia. Four semi-structured interviews with key people in two Healthy Cities programs in Europe and Australia were conducted to provide infor-mation to supplement and complement the published information and to verify theme identification. The main findings of this study are that, although there is no explicit connection between the local activities of Healthy Cities programs and the potential (or actual) adverse health impacts of climate change, Healthy Cities programs are involved in many local <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> and some of these actions, for example, those relating to improving air quality and reducing pollution, are linked implicitly to the health impacts of climate change. Through their local relationships and their participation in regional networks, Healthy Cities are able to make connections between local <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> and the health impacts of climate change. Furthermore, expanding Healthy Cities to include eco-social sustainability as a central aim not only has the potential to strengthen the links between local <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> and climate change, but also pre-sents a relevant health development setting for exploring the social and environmental sustainability of cities.

Relying on the resource-based view, we study the effect of different environmental management capabilities on a firm's market and image performance. In particular, we analyze the capabilities to implement product and process-related <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> with different types of environmental focus (materials, energy, pollution) and the capabilities to develop environmental collaborations with different types of actors (both business actors and non-business actors). To this aim we conducted a survey on 122 Italian companies. Results show that market performance and image performance have partially different antecedents. Specifically, a firm's market performance is positively affected by the capabilities to implement <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> with a focus on energy and pollution and to develop environmental collaborations both with business and with non-business actors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe corporate reasons, organizational challenges and the evolution of economic effects, social boundaries and <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> in sustainable business practices. This study is based on insights gained from eight Norwegian companies in different industries. The empirical findings indicate evolutionary changes as companies move on a continuum from superficial to embedded sustainable business models and the application of sustainable business practices. The planning, implementation and evaluation of sustainable business models evolves over time within companies and their supply chains, as well as in the marketplace and society. A limitation of this study is that it is exclusively undertaken in Norwegian companies, although the companies are from different industries with different characteristics. Future research is clearly necessary and will be conducted in other countries in similar industries, so as to explore the empirical findings from this study in other contexts. In addition, the interfaces between <b>environmental</b> <b>actions,</b> economic effects and social boundaries need to be investigated further. The study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on corporate reasons for and organizational challenges of sustainable business models, as well as environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable business practices. This study only sheds initial light on these aspects, and more work is required to confirm and extend the present findings. Specifically, further research is required into underlying corporate reasons and organizational challenges—as well as economic effects, social boundaries and <b>environmental</b> <b>actions.</b> The authors believe that the empirical findings provide useful and relevant insights applicable to both research and practice in this important and evolving element of contemporary business.

40|$|The {{expenses}} for repair, maintenance and remediation of existing concrete structures have significantly increased. A {{large proportion of}} these expenses are due to problems related to a lacking durability of the structure. Thus, to reduce these expenses it is required to make a design of the service life of the structure in which the service life is explicitly specified. In this Licentiate thesis it is described how the service life of concrete structures can be determined. The factors that have an influence on the service life of a concrete structure are described. Furthermore it is described how the service life can be mathematically modelled and which techniques {{that can be used}} to determine the service life. Three principal factors that influence the service life of a concrete structure have been identified: (1) Material properties, (2) Execution during construction and (3) <b>Environmental</b> <b>actions.</b> Lots of efforts have been made to get a better understanding of how the material properties and to some extent the execution during construction influence the service life. However, very little has been made to clarify, which influence the <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> has on the service life. The deterioration of concrete can be predicted with two principal types of mathematical models namely physical models, which are based on theories of transport in porous materials, and empirical models, which are based on observations from structures. A few examples of different prediction models dealing with chloride penetration, carbonation and corrosion of the reinforcement are shown. It is also briefly described how a prediction of the service life can be made, with a performance based design methodology and probabilistic methods. To achieve reliable results with these prediction models it is required to have knowledge about boundary and initial conditions, e. g. how the environmental conditions vary inside and at the surface of the structure. Predictions of the service life can be made with two different methodologies: deem-to-satisfy rules, based on rules of thumb, and performance-based design. Usually probabilistic methods are used to predict the service life in a performance based design. However these kinds of predictions require extensive statistical quantifications of the parameters in the mathematical models. These statistical quantifications require good knowledge about which parameters that influence the deterioration of concrete, e. g. concrete composition, <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> at the surface of the structure and/or the response from the concrete. The <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> on a concrete structure have a decisive influence on the service life of the structure. The description of the <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> can be divided into four different levels depending on the dimensional scale. The objective is to determine the <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> at the surface of the concrete structure in terms of temperature, humidity and chloride conditions and the concentration of carbon dioxide. Furthermore the response from the material is of interest, e. g. how moisture and temperature distributions are distributed in a concrete structure. It is described how the <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> at the surface of concrete structure can be derived and what the response from the concrete is described. Finally a study of the response concrete structures exposed in road environments is presented. Seven bridges in and around Göteborg, around 30 years old, have been examined to determine the chloride penetration, moisture conditions and resistance against freeze/thaw actions. The analyses have been made on cores taken from selected positions on the bridges. The results from the study show large variations in chloride penetration between the examined bridges and even on a single part of a bridge, e. g. a column. A large part of these variations are assumed to arise due to variations in <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> at the surface of the bridges...|$|R
