5|$|Shortly after Gladys {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> {{and later a}} hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> to Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> {{hurricane}} was {{a powerful}} and deadly hurricane that caused major impacts in Cuba and southern Florida. The fifth hurricane and third major hurricane of the season, the storm formed from a system near Barbados on October 4. By October 8, it had intensified into a tropical storm, and made landfall as a hurricane in Central America. The hurricane traveled towards Cuba, making landfall and wreaking havoc on the island. The storm then made a third landfall in the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> during the evening of October 18. At least 240 people were killed {{as a result of}} the hurricane, and damages totaled at least $4,135,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{most intense}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> hurricane. Many deaths occurred after ships capsized in Bahamas, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> and Cuba. Strong winds left about $2million in damage in Key West. After crossing the Gulf of Mexico, severe impact was reported in Texas, especially the Corpus Christi area. Overall, the hurricane caused 828fatalities and $22million in damage, $20million of which was inflicted in Texas alone. Three other tropical cyclones developed in September, including two tropical storms and one tropical depression, all of which left negligible impact on land. The final tropical system of the season also did not affect land and became extratropical on November15.|$|E
5|$|While Kate {{was moving}} through the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a {{hurricane}} warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers, Florida, including the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> Then-Governor of Florida Bob Graham {{declared a state of}} emergency for six counties in South Florida. However, it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in the area. Officials recommended evacuation of the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes. In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
