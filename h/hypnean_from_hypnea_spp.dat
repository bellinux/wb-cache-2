40|$|Pomacentridae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{representative}} families of herbivorous fishes inhabiting both tropical and temperate reefs, yet the vast majority of studies examining feeding within this family have been undertaken in tropical rather than temperate regions. Despite the high abundances of the pomacentrid Parma mccullochi in temperate waters of Western Australia, and their likely importance in removing algae from reefs in the region, there is a lack of information on their diet and their impact on the reef algal community. This study aims to determine the role of Parma mccullochi as an ecosystem engineer on temperate algal-dominated reefs in the metropolitan waters of Perth, Western Australia. To achieve this, the diet of P. mccullochi and any ontogenetic differences, and its impact on the reef in terms of algal composition and algal recruitment were determined. P. mccullochi in the temperate reefs of Western Australia was found to be a strict herbivore, with its diet comprising almost entirely red foliose and filamentous algae such as <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.,</b> Ceramium sp. and Brongniatrella sp., and showing no ontogenetic shift. Based on electivity indices, P. mccullochi showed a positive selection for specific algal taxa such as Brongniartella sp., Dasyclonium sp., <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.</b> and Dictyopteris spp. The species composition of macroalgae differed significantly between inside and outside P. mccullochi territories (P = 0. 010), and a caging experiment in P. mccullochi territories indicated a moderate effect on the composition of recruiting algae (P = 0. 067). Algal assemblages inside the territories were characterised by <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.</b> and Dasyclonium spp., while those outside the territories were characterised by the brown algae Ecklonia radiata and Sargassum spp., the foliose red alga Rhodimenia sonderi and the coralline red alga Amphiroa anceps. Total algal biomass was significantly lower (P = 0. 0126) while species richness was higher (P = 0. 0114) inside compared to outside territories. This study, therefore, provides the evidence to refute the theory that temperate Pomacentridae have a low impact on the temperate reefs (Jones 1992). P. mccullochi has the capacity to structure the benthic composition of reefs and maintain high biodiversity patches within kelp canopies. This effect is amplified by the high abundances of the species observed in Perth metropolitan waters, and can therefore be considered an ecosystem engineer/landscaper of temperate algal dominated reefs, highlighting its importance in ecosystem processes of temperate reefs in the region...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the diet of dugongs (Dugong dugon- Fam. Dugongidae) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas- Fam. Cheloniidqe) on the Orman Reefs in Torres Strait, between Australia and Papua New Guinea, where large numbers of these animals live sympatrically. The stomach contents of dugongs and green turtles caught in an Indigenous fishery were examined. Dugongs fed exclusively on seagrasses (mainly Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea spp. and Syringodium isoetifolium) whereas turtles consumed both seagrasses (especially Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides) and algae (mainly <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.,</b> Laurencia spp. and Caulerpa spp.). The two herbivores did not show overlap in resource use except for the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii which was abundant in the feeding area. Both species appeared to feed selectively and did not just consume the most available food items. These results are suggestive of partitioning of food resources between dugongs and green turtles but a full explanation requires more detailed, and concurrent, study of the food resources and the animals’ movements...|$|R

We examine the role of the abundant and territorial pomacentrid Parma mccullochi as an herbivore in temperate waters of southwestern Australia. Through dietary analyses, we showed that this species consumed predominantly red foliose and filamentous algae that were positively selected based on electivity indices. The species composition of macroalgae differed significantly between inside and outside P. mccullochi territories, with commonly ingested algae such as <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.</b> characterising the territory assemblages, while brown algae such as kelp Ecklonia radiata, and other foliose or coralline red algae characterised reef area outside the territories. Total algal biomass was significantly lower, while species richness was higher, inside compared to outside territories.

40|$|We {{offer the}} first {{published}} {{description of the}} feeding choices made by juvenile green turtles on a tropical feeding ground, {{in this case a}} reef flat environment. We collected 85 lavage samples from 76 turtles and compared the food eaten to the food resources available. Resampling of some individuals enabled us to gain preliminary insights into diet switching by juvenile turtles. The area of the reef flat at Green Island, Queensland, Australia, had similar proportions of coverage by seagrasses (52 %) and by algae (48 %). Seven species of seagrass and at least 26 species of algae were identified. The dominant seagrasses, on an area basis, were Cymodocea sp. (29. 7 %), Halodule sp. (11. 1 %), Thalassia sp. (6. 4 %) and Syringodium sp. (4. 5 %). The most dominant algae were Halimeda spp. (10. 2 %). and Galaxaura sp. (7. 25 %). Most juvenile green turtles ate primarily seagrass, but some individuals ate predominantly algae. The turtles showed clear preferences for the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii and the algae Gracilaria <b>spp.,</b> Gelidiella sp., <b>Hypnea</b> <b>spp.</b> despite their low abundance in many cases.

The free energy change of activation (ΔG η) increased regularly as the concentration of aqueous κ-carrageenan increased, as well as rises in temperature. Higher values of free energy change of activation, (ΔG η) showed the higher association of κ-carrageenan with water at given temperature. The values of entropy change of activation (ΔS η) of viscous flow also increased with the increase in concentration and temperature of aqueous κ-carrageenan solution.

Experiments were conducted {{in the field of}} PCSIR Laboratories Complex Karachi during December 2008 –April 2009 in randomized complete block design with three replications. Three elicitor treatments were used, a solid preparation in which the elicitor was mixed with soil (T 2 1 mg/g) and applied around the seeds in the soil. The two other preparations were liquid, T 1 and T 3 at a concentration of 100 μgglceqml− 1 and were applied around the sowing seeds and as a foliar spray on the plants, respectively. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that these treatments significantly enhanced all the growth characters of chickpea except T 2 that gave the nonsignificant difference in the plant height. Maximum plant height (80. 3 cm), number of pods plant− 1 (76. 2), number of branches plant− 1 (25. 0), number of leaves plant− 1 (125. 6), earlier flowering and high ISMs contents in leaves, stem and grains of chickpea were recorded in T 1 treated chickpea plants. In maize plants only T 1 and T 3 treatments (with minor exceptions) had significant effects on few characters like plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves plant− 1 and on ISMs contents in leaves while number of cobs plant− 1 and flowering time were nonsignificantly affected by these treatments. These results suggested that k-carrageenan elicitor {{can be used as a}} potent plant protectant as well as growth promoting agent especially for chickpea plants...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the gastroprotective activity and the mechanism underlying this activity of a sulfated-polysaccharide fraction extracted <b>from</b> the algae <b>Hypnea</b> musciformis (Wulfen) J. V. Lamour. (Gigartinales– Rhodophyta). Mice were treated with sulfated-polysaccharide fraction (3, 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg, p. o.) and, after 30 min, they were administered 50 % ethanol (0. 5 mL/ 25 g, p. o.). After 1 h, gastric damage was measured using a planimeter. In addition, samples of the stomach tissue were obtained for histopathological examination and for assays to determine the glutathione and malondialdehyde levels. Other groups of mice were pretreated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg, i. p.), aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg, i. p.), or glibenclamide (10 mg/kg, i. p.). After 30 min to the aminoguanidine group and 1 h to the other groups, sulfated-polysaccharide fraction (30 mg/kg, p. o.) was administered and gastric damage was induced as described above. Sulfated-polysaccharide fraction prevented ethanol-induced gastric injury in a dosedependent manner. However, treatment with L-NAME or glibenclamide reversed this gastroprotective effect. Administration of aminoguanidine did not infl uence the effect of sulfated-polysaccharide fraction. Our results suggest that sulfated-polysaccharide fraction exerts a protective effect against ethanol-induced gastric damage via activation of the NO/KATP pathway...|$|R
40|$|Benthic algal {{cover and}} trends in its changes are {{indicators}} of water state in coastal areas. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional methods (scuba diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution yet {{is very expensive}} and time consuming. Due to the recent global changes, several parts of the Brazilian coast may be impacted jeopardizing benthic macroalgal ecosystems. Mapping that benthic macroalgal cover by remote sensing can significantly improve the decision making. However, it is required certain knowledge about the optical signatures of different bottom types. To use remote sensing properly, {{it is necessary to}} build a spectral library of the most common macroalgae found within the Brazilian coast. Thus, using a spectroradiometer in the field, in several Brazilian beaches, the reflectances were measured for red, green, and brown macroalgae, seagrass, sand, pebble, and wet and dry decaying mats of macroalgae and higher plants. That field data were organized toward the optical spectral bands found in the MERIS satellite and analyzed looking for the best index to represent each group (red, green and brown).

40|$|International audienceStudies on {{the reef}} flat of Saint-Gilles La Saline between 1987 and 2009 {{compared}} spatio-temporal variations of primary producers on two sites, Toboggan and Planch'Alizés. Toboggan (Site-T) is an oligotrophic site characterized by Acropora corals, abundant sea urchins and few primary producers. Planch'Alizés (Site-P) is a heterotrophic site, characterized by massive corals, abundant primary producers and occasional sea urchins. From shore to outer reef front, the reef flat comprises three parts: the back reef (B), the coral zone with Large coral strips (L) and the coral zone with Narrow coral strips (N). This paper (which is Part 2 in a three part series) {{is divided into}} four sections. The first (1993, 1996, and 2002) focuses on four groups of primary producers: cyanophytes; turfs (including Stegastes epilithic algal communities); encrusting coralline algae; macroalgae. Their abundance and dominant species were recorded in the three subzones, B, L and N, using 50 m-line intercept transects (LITs). The second section (1998 to 2009 inclusive, on the two same sites), reports on annually monitored turfs, encrusting coralline and macroalgae on two permanent 20 m LITs. These annual records extend periodic records from these same LITs from 1987, 1993, 1996 and 2002. The third section describes species richness of primary producers at the infracentimetric level in zones B, L and N in 1994. In the final section, seasonal variability is documented as changes in the biomass of dominant macroalgae reported monthly {{over a period of}} seven months (1993 - 94). In 1993 - 2002, primary producers were dominant at P (average ~ 60 %) but inconspicuous at T (~ 5 %). In terms of relative cover, turfs and macroalgae were the dominant forms at both sites (75 % turfs, 10 % macroalgae at T; 24 % t. and 52 % m. at P). On both sites, cyanophytes significantly decreased over time. Among turfs, fine filamentous turfs were prevalent on the back reef on both sites, and also on the narrow outer coral zone at P. Stegastes turf territories dominated both coral zones at Site-T (L and N), but only the L coral zone at Site-P. Encrusting coralline algae were sparse at Site-T but locally abundant at Site-P, where they increased significantly from 1993 to 1996 in both coral zones. There was a major decrease in macroalgae between 1993 and 2002 at P. There were marked differences in the trajectories of decline of the dominant soft macroalgae (<b>Hypnea</b> valentiae, Padina <b>spp,</b> Dictyota spp, Turbinaria ornata and Gracilaria canaliculata). Seventy six primary producer species were recorded in the infracentimetric study (52 species at T and 67 at P). Different algae dominated different areas at both sites. At Toboggan, locally dominant species were the small Gelidium pusillum, an unidentified Melobesiae, Jania adhaerens, the encrusting corallines Hydrolithon onkondes and Lobophora variegata, the turfs Polysiphonia mollis and Anotrichium tenue (mainly in Stegastes territories), Jania adhaerens and Dictyosphaeria verluysii. At P, the dominants were Mesophyllum erubescens encrusting dead hard substrates and decimetric bioclasts in the back reef (B), where they form numerous rhodoliths. In the P coral zones, the dominant taxa were Lyngbya majuscula (cyanobacteria) followed by Hydrolithon onkodes, Blennothrix cantharidosma and Lithophyllum kotschyanum. Jania adhaerens, Hydrolithon onkodes and Gelidiella acerosa were dominant in the narrow coral zone (N). The local composition of the algal community appears to be more related to geomorphological zones and {{the presence or absence of}} the territorial Stegastes fish than to environmental differences between T and P. There was strong seasonal change in macroalgae biomass in 1993 - 4. On the back reef of both sites, peak biomass was due to Hypnea valentiae in February, when it is significantly greater than it was in January. Dictyosphaeria verluysii was dominant and highly visible at Site-T, but extremely rare and hidden below the Hypnea valentiae at P. On the outer coral zone (N), biomass was significantly different between most months on both sites. At Site-T in summer (December to March) the peak biomass was due to the "sponge seaweed" Hydroclathrus clathratus (Phaeophyceae) which exploded in December, declined in January and disappeared in February. At Site-P, H. clathratus was almost absent, and instead, Gracilaria canaliculata dominated the community throughout the year. Dictyosphaearia verluysii and D. cavernosa were prevalent in winter, the former preferring intertidal locations. In autumn (April - June), Turbinaria ornata invaded the subtidal substrates on the outer N-zones. To conclude this Part 2 of the Reunion Island Fringing Reef series, we discuss the influence of nutrients and herbivores (especially sea urchins and the territorial damselfish Stegastes) on the abundance and distribution of primary producers...|$|R
