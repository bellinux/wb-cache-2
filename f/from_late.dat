5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. <b>From</b> <b>late</b> January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adults have a {{complete}} moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting <b>from</b> <b>late</b> May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts when they are about eight weeks old.|$|E

5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is <b>from</b> <b>late</b> February to late August, in Iowa it ranges <b>from</b> <b>late</b> April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
