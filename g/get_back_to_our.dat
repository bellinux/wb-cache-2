500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after {{that we were going}} to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. It took a little bit of time to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States. The album's lead single, [...] "Crush 'Em", appeared on the soundtrack for [...] and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.|$|E

I'm trying to forget the whole thing," [...] Gambaiana {{said in a telephone}} interview from his home in Iowa in 2013.|$|E

60|$|In Leghorn, as {{everywhere}} else, we were chilled to the heart, {{except when}} the sunshine fell directly upon us; and {{we returned to}} the steamer with a feeling as if we were <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> home; for this life of wandering makes a three days' residence in one place seem like home.|$|R

30|$|Thus, in both {{of these}} equally {{legitimate}} and intriguing contexts—pravṛtti and nivṛtti—one’s respective stance towards sexuality is a most salient feature of one’s spirituality at large. And so, <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> larger argument here, even though sexuality obviously consists of much more than just sexual fluids, the importance of such fluids either to one’s vitality or path of transgressive spirituality should not be understated. And since the reliance of these fluids upon the presence of water is taken as a given, we feel this is another instance in which water has a critical and hence sacred level of functioning within Hindu spirituality.|$|R
5000|$|On January 30, 2001, HFI {{was placed}} under a Company Creditor's Arrangement Act {{protective}} order, CCAA, pending the submission of a reorganization plan to its creditors.

5000|$|Ada Loven - an ex-colleague of Brabbit. She {{was one of}} {{the very}} few to go to Paraworld with Brabbit and has been alive for at least a hundred years. At first she went along with Brabbit's plans, but began to think what she was doing and then started to betray him. At the start of the game she helps Brabbit dispose of the 3 heroes by sending them into Paraworld, but {{eventually}} helps them out by defeating a small band of barbarians. She then helps the 3 heroes get away but they are swept up in a storm. The 3 heroes think she has drowned, but she has survived and once she <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> world Brabbit accuses her of being a traitor. She angrily walks out of Brabbit's Office, and is not seen again until Chapter 14: The Prisoners as one of the prisoners, most likely because she was branded a traitor and she has been locked up.|$|R
