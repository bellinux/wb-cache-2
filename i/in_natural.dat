5|$|Diamonds exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones.

Some natural type IIb diamonds phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. <b>In</b> <b>natural</b> diamonds, fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish.

5|$|Most helium on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
