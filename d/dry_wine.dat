5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a <b>dry</b> <b>wine,</b> and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

5000|$|From the 1980s, {{and even}} more from the 1990s, {{production}} of <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> became much more common in Germany. Thus, wines designated [...] "Spätlese trocken" [...] in many cases came to represent the best <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> from many wineries. From the early 2000s, the new designations Grosses Gewächs and Erstes Gewächs have become more common, {{with the result that}} remaining Spätlese trocken wines rather represents the second-best <b>dry</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{temperature}} of {{service is a}} criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice. Between 8 and 9°C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> service between 10 and 12°C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14°C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.|$|E
25|$|At mealtimes {{very dry}} wines with little {{minerals}} are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity {{of white wine}} counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken {{at any time during}} the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.|$|E
25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E

50|$|With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of the new classifications of top <b>dry</b> German <b>wines,</b> Erstes Gewächs and Grosses Gewächs, the Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter (VDP) has discouraged the continued use of Auslese trocken, {{as it has been}} seen as confusing for the consumer to have sweet and powerful <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> with the same Prädikat. However a significant number of VDP members are still using the Prädikat classification on <b>dry</b> <b>Wines,</b> since the Prädikat only is dedicated to the quality level of the picked grapes and not the taste.|$|R
25|$|Grenache prefers hot, dry soils {{that are}} well drained but it {{relatively}} adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets roulés heat retaining stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retain enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. The skin of Grenache is thin and lightly pigmented, making wines with pale color and low tannins. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produced darker, more tannic wines such as {{those found in the}} Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines than those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery {{decided to}} try {{draining}} some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a <b>dry</b> <b>wine,</b> and tried to sell it {{under the name of}} Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saignée method. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation, so he added [...] "White Zinfandel" [...] to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make [...] "white" [...] wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. [...] However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Rosé had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley.|$|E

Sometimes Auslese is also {{made into a}} powerful <b>dry</b> <b>wine,</b> but the designation Auslese trocken has been discouraged after the introduction of Grosses Gewächs. Auslese is the Prädikat which covers the widest range of wine styles, and can be a dessert wine.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, and {{more so in}} the 1990s, Austrian wine moved into new styles, which {{primarily}} meant less semi-sweet and sweet white <b>wines,</b> and more <b>dry</b> white <b>wines</b> and red <b>wines.</b> For these <b>dry</b> <b>wines,</b> the Prädikatswein designations (such as Spätlese or Auslese) shared with the German wine classification system, were seen as less suitable. Just as in Germany, much of the high-end <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> therefore ended up using a designation, Qualitätswein, which in principle was seen as below the Prädikatswein. In Wachau, regional designations for <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> were created as a response; Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd. However, several organisations pressed in the 1990s for a different national system to be introduced, with [...] "appellation-style" [...] designations based on geographical origin rather than on must weight, with regulations for each DAC regarding allowed grape varieties and wine styles.|$|R

2500|$|The first popular diet was [...] "Banting", {{named after}} the English {{undertaker}} William Banting. In 1863, he wrote a booklet called Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public, which contained the particular plan for the diet he had successfully followed. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and <b>dry</b> <b>wine.</b> The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, sweet foods, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting’s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would {{be used as a}} model for modern diets. The pamphlet's popularity was such that the question [...] "Do you bant?"

2500|$|On wine labels, German wine may be {{classified}} {{according to the}} residual sugar of the wine. Trocken refers to <b>dry</b> <b>wine.</b> These wines have less than 9grams/liter of residual sugar. Halbtrocken wines are off-dry and have 9-18grams/liter of residual sugar. Due to the high acidity ("crispness") of many German wines, the taste profile of many halbtrocken wines fall within the [...] "internationally dry" [...] spectrum rather than being appreciably sweet. Feinherb wines are slightly more sweet than halbtrocken wines. Lieblich wines are noticeably sweet; except for the high category Prädikatsweine of type Beerenauslese and above, lieblich wines from Germany are usually of the low Tafelwein category. The amount of German wines produced in a lieblich style has dropped markedly since the style went out of fashion in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|It {{provides}} a fairly neutral palate for {{the expression of}} terroir, vintage variation and the winemaker's treatment. In cool areas the juice is sweet but high in acid with a [...] full-bodied fruity palate. In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under ripened grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now the less ripe grapes are made into popular sparkling wines such as Crémant de Loire. The white wines of the Anjou AOC are perhaps the best expression of Chenin as a <b>dry</b> <b>wine,</b> with flavors of quince and apples. In nearby Vouvray AOC they aim for an off-dry style, developing honey and floral characteristics with age. In the best vintages the grapes can be left on the vines to develop noble rot, producing an intense, viscous dessert wine which may improve considerably with age.|$|E
2500|$|Wine tasting is {{the sensory}} {{examination}} {{and evaluation of}} wine. Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and spices. The sweetness of wine {{is determined by the}} amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. <b>Dry</b> <b>wine,</b> for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine [...] "breathe" [...] {{for a couple of hours}} before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. Decanting (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flesh of}} the grape is the most {{important}} part – it is between 75 and 85% of the weight of the grape. It consists of large polygonal cells which are very thin-walled. With a low pressure the cells leak their contents: the wort. The {{flesh of the}} grape contains mainly water. The organic components are fermentable sugars (between 170-230 grams for a <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> and between 200 and 300 grams per litre or even more for Fortified wines) and organic acids, especially malic acid and tartaric acid. Acids occur in larger amounts in the centre of the berry while the sugars are in greater proportion at the periphery. This heterogeneity in the distribution of sugars, acids, and inorganic compounds in the berry is used during pressing, especially in Champagne pressing. This process separates them as it happens and uses them to measure the progress of the [...] "vintage", the first and second tailles, and finally the rebêches of insufficient quality to be made into AOC wine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} Barolo {{was once a}} sweet wine and that it took a French oenologist {{to turn it into}} a <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> has been {{recently}} challenged, based on new research, by Kerin O'Keefe. According to this revision of Barolo's history, Paolo Francesco Staglieno was responsible for the modern dry version. He was the author of a winemaking manual, Istruzione intorno al miglior metodo di fare e conservare i vini in Piemonte, published in 1835. It was Staglieno who was called upon by Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, who appointed him to the position of oenologist at his Grinzane estate between 1836 and 1841. Staglieno's task was to produce quality wines geared towards ageing and stable enough to be exported. Staglieno fermented the wines dry, something that at the time was referred to as [...] "the Staglieno method". Oudart was a grape and wine merchant, not an oenologist, who in the early 1800s moved to Genoa and set up a winery, Maison Oudard et Bruché. By the time Oudart turned up in Alba, King Carlo Alberto and Cavour were already following Staglieno's guidelines and both were producing dry wines. This revised version of the history of Barolo was positively accepted by other experts.|$|E
2500|$|Today {{there are}} {{multiple}} sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, {{the mood of the}} meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert Mark Oldman has noted [...] "Food and Wine pairing can be like sex and pizza: even when it's bad, it can still be pretty good" [...] and gives the example of wedding cake with a dry sparkling wine. A very <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, [...] "the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard" [...] and is not a [...] "good pairing" [...] according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline.
