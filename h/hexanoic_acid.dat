50|$|Biosynthesis of hectochlorin {{starts with}} hctA (Figure 1A), {{responsible}} for the start unit, which has 53% similarity to an Acyl-ACP synthetase in Fischerella and is predicted to generate a <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acid</b> that starts the hectochlorin molecule. This <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acid</b> gets halogenated twice at the fifth carbon by the gene hctB, generating the gem-dichloro group in 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acid. For such, hctB has one halogenation domain in the N-terminus, which is 47% similar to a halogenase at Microcystis aeruginosa and also contains all conserved residues for the binding of Fe2+/2-oxoglutarate co-factor. In the C-terminus, one ACP domain is present and it is fairly homologous to several others ACP domain at cyanobacteria, like Curacin A, Jamaicamide and so on. As mentioned before, hctC is a transposase of unknown function {{and it is not}} directly related in the molecule synthesis. Next, this 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acquires one KS extension by hctD. This gene consists of a single KS module with a minimal configuration (KS-AT-CP) plus one KR and cMT, producing a 7,7-dichloro-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-octanoic acid. HctE consists of a bi-modular NRPS, of which the first module incorporates an isovaleric acid and the second module incorporates a heterocyclic cysteine. In the first module, the adenlyation-domain (A domain) has a mutation substituting a conserved aspartate residue (Asp235) that is related to interactions with the amino group of the cognate amino acid, therefore, incorporating isovaleric acid instead an amino acid. This hydroxyl group that substitutes an amino group condensates with the previous carbonyl from the KS extension. The second module has 67% identity to CurF and BarG (from Curacin A and Barbamide BGCs) and is predicted to adenylate and heterocyclize a cysteine, as well as oxidize it by FMN-dependent oxidase present in between adenlyation conserved motifs, catalyzing the formation of a thiazole ring (Figure 1C). HctF gene has remarkable similarity to hctE, although, there are two main differences: the iso-valeric acid incorporated does not condensate by the hydroxyl group that substitute an amino group, instead, it condensates be the hydroxyl group in the side chain created by a P450 oxidation (Figure 1B); hctF has an extra thioesterase domain that converts thioester bond to ester bond and catalyze the attack from the C-terminal free hydroxyl group to this newly formed ester, cyclizing the molecule. The final genes hctG and hctH probably encode two P450 that oxidize the side chain of both isovaleric acids (Figure 1D). Lastly, a post-NRPS modification happens in the free hydroxyl group from the second isovaleric acid, adding an acetyl group. This addition is not predicted in the current biosynthesis, although the absence of this post-NRPS modification would produce the analogue previously mentioned, deacetylhectochlorin.|$|E
50|$|Hectochlorin is a lipopeptide that {{exhibits}} potent antifungal activity against C. albicans and {{a number}} of plants pathogens, as well as inhibiting growth of human cell lines by hyperpolymerization of actin. It was originally isolated from the filamentous cyanobacterium Moorea producens JHB, collected from Hector Bay, Jamaica, 1996, which is a strain also known for being the producer of other two potent biomolecules named Jamaicamide A and Cryptomaldamide (unpublished). Due to its activity against plants pathogens, synthetic efforts elucidated the compound’s total synthesis in 2002. Moorea species are normally the main component of the dietary of some sea hares, which concentrate the cyanobacterial metabolites as a mechanism of defense from predators. Therefore, in 2005, hectochlorin was re-isolated from the Thai sea hare Bursatella leachii, along with a new analogue, deacetylhectochlorin. Another reisolation of hectochlorin was reported in 2013, from another Moorea producens strain (RS05), isolated from the Red Sea, surprising in a non-tropical environment, as opposed to the other Moorea strains isolated before. The predicted biosynthesis of hectochlorin was published in 2007 and consists in a hybrid NRPS-PKS, with a <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acid</b> as start unit that becomes halogenated twice in the position 5, producing fairly rare gem-dichloro group, that along with two 2,3-dihydroxyisovaleric acid (DHIV) units compose a very interesting bioactive molecule.|$|E

Fatty acid absorption also was measured. Segments of terminal ileum were perfused at steady state with isotonic electrolyte solutions containing 11. 2 mM glucose, 4. 5 mM taurocholate, and 0. 1 - 5. 0 mM fatty acid. Three C 18 fatty acids, oleic acid, 10 (9) -hydroxystearic acid, and ricinoleic acid, completely inhibited water absorption at 5 mM. Sodium, chloride, and potassium absorptions were inhibited {{in parallel with}} absorption of water. Differences between the potencies of C 18 fatty acids were apparent when lesser concentrations were perfused.

The polar group of C 18 fatty acids was modified by conjugating oleic and ricinoleic acids with taurine.

Short-chain fatty acids (C 3 and C 4) and their hydroxylated derivatives were ineffective at 5 mM. When water absorption was inhibited, absorption of glucose and taurocholate was decreased.

However, the basal ABA levels were not altered. <b>Hexanoic</b> <b>acid</b> primed callose deposition against B. cinerea in a cultivar-dependent manner. Treated plants from Ailsa Craig, Moneymaker, and Rheinlands Ruhm showed increased callose deposition but not from Castlemart. <b>Hexanoic</b> <b>acid</b> did not prime callose accumulation in flc plants upon B. cinerea infection; therefore, ABA could act as a positive regulator of Hx-IR by enhancing callose deposition.

The enzyme-catalysed first-order exchange rate of the pro- 2 S proton of glycine was approximately 7000 times more efficient than that of the pro- 2 R proton of glycine at both pH 7. 0 and 7. 8. 1 H-NMR was used to follow the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates of the alpha-protons of L- and D- 2 -amino derivatives of butyric, pentanoic and <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acids</b> at pH 7. 8. Increasing the size of the R-group leads to a progressive change in the stereospecificity of the exchange reaction from the pro- 2 S proton of glycine to the 2 R proton of L-amino acids.

The limonoids obtained from AI were azadirachtin A and B, nimbin, salannin and their acetyl derivatives; while from MA we obtained a new triterpenoid, named 3 -α-tigloylmelianone, as well as three known limonoids named methyl kulonate, 21 -β-acetoxymelianone and melianone. The elucidation of the limonoids’ structures was performed by means of 1 D and 2 D-NMR and the accuracy of theoretical exact mass values, was deduced by HPLC-Q-TOF analysis. According to our results 21 -β-acetoxymelianone and 3 -α-tigloylmelianone show both antiproliferative (IC 50 = 100 and 91. 8 μg/mL) and cytotoxic (CC 50 = 90. 6 and 64. 7 μg/mL) activity on the tumorigenic cell line A 549, while melianone exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity with a CC 50 calculated at 3. 6 μg/mL. Methyl kulonate as well as limonoids isolated from AI were found neither cytotoxic nor antiproliferative. Methanol extract from MA fruits was analysed by GC/MS and found to contain hexadecanoic, acetic, and <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acids</b> as well as furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural. The extract was found nematicidal on Meloidogyne incognita, both in terms of juveniles paralysis (EC 50 / 96 h = 0. 04...|$|R
40|$|This work forms part of {{a global}} study on the {{recycling}} into alcoholic fermentation of condensates arising from the concentration of vinasses. Its purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of reverse osmosis (RO) in the treatment and exploitation of these condensates, i. e., elimination of the anti-fermentation molecules they contain (formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, <b>hexanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> 2, 3 -butanediol, furfural and phenyl- 2 -ethyl-alcohol) {{so that they could}} be recycled. The experimental system used was a DSS Labstack M 20 - 0. 72 filtration system with flat, Filmtec FT 30 Sea Water (SW) membranes from Dow. As the inhibitory compounds include organic acids, the effect of pH was studied: trials at pH 3. 0, 5. 2, 7. 5 and 10 were performed at 40 bar and 25 - 30 degrees C, and monitored by chemical analysis and inhibition tests. Rejection coefficients were found to be higher than 85 % for all compounds at pH > 5. RO permeates arising from the treatment of condensates with a pH 7. 5 and 10 proved not inhibitory. Because of a strong rise between 6 and 12 during the titration, working at pH higher than 6 needs a fine tuning of pH value or the use of membranes resisting high pH values. At pH 6, however, 10 % inhibition is still present; in order to eliminate all traces of inhibition, it would then be necessary to envisage double RO or coupling with another process...|$|R
