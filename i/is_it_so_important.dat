Because the roots of the chords will sound whether we want them to or not, whether or not the {{alphabetical}} symbol is correct. The root progression which emerges may not coincide with what we think we have written; it may be better or it may be worse; but art does not permit chance. The root progression supports the work. The total root progression is heard as a substantive element, almost like another melody, and it determines the tonal basis of the music. And the tonal basis of a piece is very important to the construction of themes and to the orchestration.|$|E
50|$|It {{seems that}} in the West eastern martial arts have, for a long time, been taught without much {{reference}} to the knowledge pertaining {{to the field of}} the healing arts, whereas in the East there was traditionally a strong interface between both practices - not least for the purpose of sustaining physical strength and healing injury. As mentioned above, language barriers, uncertainty of oral tradition and lack of in-depth training and proper source material as well as the vast variety of schools can easily lead to terminological imprecision, misinterpretation and misunderstanding. An example at hand is the question of the Hara: what and where is the Hara or Dantian (tanden); why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> in both traditions; and how is it related to the Eight Extraordinary Vessels and the other energy pathways (meridians or channels).|$|E
50|$|Retailers {{are pushing}} for tagging each {{individual}} item. In fact, large companies like Wal-Mart, JC Penney, and Dillard’s are issuing electronic product code mandates, where they request their suppliers to comply with these EPC protocols. In 2005, it was required that the suppliers use RFID tagging at the pallet and case level, {{but now it is}} required that they tag on the item-level as well. The reason why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> for them to implement this is because they want to avoid losing a sale over an out-of-stock item, which they believe accounts for a big part of their losses. Also, if they know where an item is at all times then it easier to move it to where it is supposed to be. By doing this they reduce transportation costs, they gain added shelf visibility and it drives down wasteful overstock.|$|E

30|$|There {{is growing}} {{consensus}} among leaders today that business exists, {{not to make}} money, but {{to make the world}} better, and most agree that both employees and customers want to associate with enterprises that provide a sense of purpose. 90 % of executives have said that their companies understands the importance of purpose, but “only 46 percent said it informs their strategic and operational decision-making.” (Izzo and Vanderwielen, 2018). Every leader must have a purpose, and they have a responsibility to address this significant question: why do we exist? Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that we exist? what is the contribution we want to make? Why is the world better because we are here?

This book considers the nature of significance and the way it is continually accomplished within activity, communication and representation. It argues that significance is generated at the intersection of signs and systems, which involves the enactment of forma (the substance of a sign), informa (the content of a sign) and performa (the use of signs in coordinated action). In demonstrating the value of this perspective the book employs the innovative approach of considering examples and cases from different times, cultures and species.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will present some ideas about {{successful}} communication to obtain intersubjectivity/mutual understanding in systems development.

The gap between what you can and cannot express has to be bridged by means of pedagogical support. The issues of learning and teaching are primarily discussed in relation to some common forms of cooperation in systems development, such as dialogues, group work and assembly meetings. The pedagogical premises for supporting communication and using methods to obtain mutual understanding are presented by means of various examples. 1...|$|E
40|$|As editors, {{one of the}} {{key issues}} we {{consider}} when deciding whether to send a manuscript for review is how well the paper has been theorised. Many of the submissions we receive describe projects that have been undertaken but do not explain to readers how the issues described can be understood, as though the description contains self-evident truths. Many such papers are not sent for review because they lack adequate theorisation. But what is ‘theory’ and why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important?</b> Theory, according to Richard Pring, can be understood as ‘the assumptions which lie behind practice’ and as ‘tightly organised systems of explanation’ (Pring, 2004, p. 77). A more systematic explanation can be contrasted with ideas that are said to be ‘common sense’. The importance of theorising teacher education is that it promotes scholarly inquiry, adds to a professional body of knowledge and has the potential to produce insights and alternative understandings. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to address a gap in {{scholarship}} concerning memory in Deuteronomy. While the trend in biblical studies has been to look at texts as memory products, we shall take a different tack by analyzing the text as a memory producer. That is, we look not at how cultural memory shaped Deuteronomy, but how Deuteronomy itself aims to shape cultural memory. We approach this task by leveraging appropriate tools from contemporary memory research, especially from the realms of linguistics, sociology, and psychology. We train them, in particular, on the what, the why, and the how: What is Deuteronomy's conception of memory, why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>important,</b> and how does the book seek to inculcate it?
