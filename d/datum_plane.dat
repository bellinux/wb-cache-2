Mating relations between <b>datum</b> <b>planes</b> are shown to involve translational and rotational errors, which are related to form tolerances and are usually neglected in tolerance analysis. To evaluate these errors, the contact between <b>datum</b> <b>planes</b> was simulated by a stochastic model, where two surface profiles are randomly generated and then registered to reproduce a mating condition. Concepts of fractal geometry were exploited to make the generation consistent with the autocorrelation properties of actual surfaces resulting from manufacturing processes.

40|$|Accurate {{velocity}} {{model building}} is a key in achieving high quality subsalt images. To reach this goal, we propose a target oriented and efficient velocity analysis methodology. Our methodology comprises of two steps. In the first step the surface data is downward extrapolated to a new <b>datum</b> <b>plane</b> using a beam based redatuming algorithm. In the second step we switch to a Kirchhoff or fast beam migration algorithm to perform the actual velocity analysis. The redatuming process has the advantage that it not only regularizes the subsurface data, but also reduces the data to a shorter recording times and a narrower offset range. Most importantly the resulting wave field at the new <b>datum</b> <b>plane</b> is generally much simpler in nature as supra salt sediment and top salt reflected as well as refracted arrivals have been removed – hence revealing the weaker subsalt events. A fast migration method can therefore be used to scan the subsalt velocity {{to determine the best}} image quality.

To this end positions on the object are measured, resulting {{in a collection of}} points in space. From this collection of points one wishes to extract information on atness, roundness, etc. of the object. In this paper we study one particular feature of objects, the angularity. The angularity indicates how well a plane makes a specified angle with another plane. We study the problem in 2 -dimensional space (where the planes become lines) and in 3 -dimensional space. In 2 -dimensional space the problem is equivalent to computing the smallest wedge of the a given angle that contains all the points. We give an O(n² log n) algorithm for this problem.

5000|$|The {{first of}} the Optical Landing Systems was another British innovation, the Mirror Landing Aid invented by Lieutenant Commander H. C. N. Goodhart RN. This was a gyroscopically-controlled concave mirror (in later designs {{replaced}} by a Fresnel lens Optical Landing System) {{on the port side}} of the deck. On either side of the mirror was a line of green [...] "datum" [...] lights. A bright orange [...] "source" [...] light was directed into the mirror creating the [...] "ball" [...] (or [...] "meatball" [...] in later USN parlance), which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land. The position of the ball compared to the datum lights indicated the aircraft's position in relation to the desired glidepath: if the ball was above the <b>datum,</b> the <b>plane</b> was high; below the <b>datum,</b> the <b>plane</b> was low; between the <b>datum,</b> the <b>plane</b> was on glidepath.

40|$|A {{simplified}} optical method, {{based on}} interference phenomena of diffused light, is described for {{the determination of}} isopachic patterns. The procedure consists in using a monochromatic diffused light beam to illuminate the model surface. If an optically flat glass plate, used as <b>datum</b> <b>plane,</b> is brought {{in contact with the}} model front surface an interference pattern is produced related to the thickness of the air-film between the <b>datum</b> <b>plane</b> and the surface of the model. Interference patterns before and after loading of the specimen allow the determination of isopachics. Curves of variation of interference fringes throughout the surface of the specimen, before their use for the determination of thickness variation, must be readjusted in convenient scale {{as well as for the}} elimination of superimposed simple interference patterns due to arbitrary inclination of the datum optical plane before and after loading. The method does not necessitate a complicated equipment. It is straightforward and very sensitive. It can be applied to transparent as well as to opaque models made of metal sheets. It can also be used as a supplementary means to measure thickness-strains in the birefringent coating method. The surface of the model though polished could not be obligatorily optically flat.
