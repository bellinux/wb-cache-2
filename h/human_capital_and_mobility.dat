In this study, we analyze intergenerational earnings <b>mobility</b> among immigrants <b>and</b> the earnings of second-generation immigrants, i.e. children with foreign-born parents in Sweden. Most empirical studies on intergenerational transmission of <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> earnings <b>mobility</b> in economics departs, {{in one way or}} the other, from the Becker and Tomes’ ([1986]) model. In the Becker and Tomes model the parental generation renounces a share of their consumption possibilities and invests it in the skill formation of their children. These investments generate a pattern of persistence in labor earnings over generations. In order to study intergenerational mobility among different ethnic groups, Borjas ([1992 – 1994]) extends the Becker and Tomes model by introducing “ethnic capital”, a ethnic group specific component in the intergenerational transmission of <b>human</b> <b>capital,</b> which works as an externality in the <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation process.|$|R

We focus on isolating the impact of two measures of <b>human</b> <b>capital,</b> formal education <b>and</b> work experi-ence, on the occupational mobility of young workers who have only fairly recently entered the labor market. We employ a semi-parametric double index based es-timator for discrete choice models, which allows a flexible relationship between the <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> variables <b>and</b> occupational <b>mobility.</b> We find statistically, and economically, strong negative effects from both formal education and work expe-rience on occupational mobility.

Over the past two decades, social scientists in a range of fields have in effect carried out a major programme of research on science, technology and innovation. If there is any unity in this research, it is simply the view that these activities are social and economic processes, not simply technical processes of discovery and invention. The argument here is that this research has reached the stage where it is both necessary and possible to rethink the rationale, objectives and instruments of policies in the general areas of science, technology, innovation and industrial change. At the same time, this background research work opens up new areas of policy-relevant questions. This paper therefore overviews some of the main themes in modern research in innovation and technological change, focusing on their implications for policy. How does recent research change our conceptions of the appropriate objectives and methods of science and technology policy? Against this background, what are the main unresolved problems facing policy-makers over the next ten years? What kinds of conclusions can we draw regarding research priorities and objectives for policy researchers in the years ahead? After discussing these issues, the next section explores how these problems can be investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of knowledge transfer and explains the factors that enable or impede absorption capacity and knowledge transfer in the MENA countries, with particular reference to the case of Egypt. We employ the conceptual framework used in the international literature on absorption capacity and international knowledge transfer channels including FDI, international trade, ICT, education, <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> university-industry linkage, and we examine the factors that enable or impede absorption capacity and knowledge transfer channels in the MENA region and Egypt respectively. One interesting element in our study is that we present a systematic framework for the factors that enable or impede knowledge transfer in Egypt and the MENA region. We find that the factors hindering absorption capacity and knowledge transfer are related to institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, higher education and training, goods market efficiency and labour market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness and capacity for innovation. Our results are consistent with the stylized facts in the MENA literature regarding the impediment factors hampering the transfer of knowledge in the MENA region. Our results are also in line with the stylized facts in the international literature regarding the interaction and linkage between the different knowledge transfer channels. The major policy implication from our findings is that knowledge transfer is facilitated by supporting the linkages between the different knowledge transfer channels within this systematic framework. Knowledge transfer through utilization of FDI is facilitated by the sound institutions for the provision of sufficiently qualified labour, ICT infrastructure, opening up to international trade, good university-industry cooperation, R&D and innovation capacity.

40|$|This paper studies {{individual}} log real wage {{change of}} {{east and west}} Germans over the period 1990 / 91 to 1995 / 96 {{using data from the}} German Socio-economic Panel. Parameters are estimated by median regression. <b>Human</b> <b>capital</b> theory <b>and</b> job <b>mobility</b> theories have implications for wage changes that differ between a transition and a non-transition economy. Wage changes decrease in experience according to <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> theory. But during a transition shock the introduction of new production techniques implies that experienced and inexperienced workers invest similarly in on-the-job training. Hence, annual wage changes do not vary much with experience. The estimation results reflect this difference. Matching and on-the-job search theory imply the following: A higher a worker's experience the higher his/her match quality and in turn the less (more) he/she can gain (lose) from an additional voluntary (involuntary) job change. But a transition shock destroys the high match quality of many experienced workers' jobs, so that wage changes due to voluntary and involuntary job change vary less with experience in a transition country than in a non-transition country. For involuntary job change, I find evidence for this hypothesis. Causal effects of job mobility on wages are estimated by comparing wage changes of this period movers with wage changes of next period movers. The results show that voluntary job changes raise real wages of both east and west Germans; involuntary changes tend to lower real hourly wages.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} intersection between labor and financial markets, in which labor mobility plays a fundamental role. Unlike physical assets such as buildings or machines, <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> can actually {{walk away from}} the firm as employees and managers switch employers. The interaction between labor <b>mobility,</b> firm risk <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> has been remarkably under-researched until now. The main question of this broad project is how differences in the flexibility of workers to find employment across different industries [...] labor mobility [...] affects the owners of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>capital.</b> The three parts of the dissertation look at this question from different angles. The first part, Labor <b>Mobility</b> <b>and</b> the Cross-Section of Expected Returns, focuses on the effect of labor mobility on the degree of operating leverage of a firm and thus on asset returns. I construct a dynamic model where worker's employment decisions affect the productivity of <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> asset prices in predictable ways. The model shows that reliance on a workforce with flexibility to enter and exit an industry translates into a form of operating leverage that amplifies equity-holders' exposure to productivity shocks. Consequently, firms in an industry with mobile workers have higher systematic risk loadings and higher expected asset returns. I use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct a novel measure of labor supply mobility, in line with the model, based on the composition of occupations across industries over time. I document a positive and economically significant cross-sectional relation between measures of labor <b>mobility,</b> operating leverage, <b>and</b> expected asset returns. This relation is not explained by firm characteristics known in the literature to predict expected returns. The second part, Aggregate Asset-Pricing Implications of <b>Human</b> <b>Capital</b> Mobility in General Equilibrium, extends the model in the first chapter to consider the general equilibrium implications of labor mobility. The setup is based on a multi-industry dynamic economy with production. The extended model shows that mobility of labor affects not only cash-flows, but also aggregate risk, and the equity premium. This part considers two different types of <b>human</b> <b>capital.</b> Generalist <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> can move between industries, while specialized <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>capital</b> cannot. The greater relative mobility of <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> relative to physical capital affects how aggregate risk in the economy is split between these two components of total wealth. The model shows that aggregate consumption and wealth increase when <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> is more mobile. However, at the same time, aggregate risk and the equity risk premium also increase under <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> mobility. I assume that the workforce in the economy is exogenously given in the first two chapters of this dissertation. This assumption is relaxed in the third chapter, Investments in <b>Human</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>and</b> Expected Asset Returns, where I endogenize the composition of occupations to discuss the interaction between <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> investments <b>and</b> labor <b>mobility.</b> This chapter focuses on the decision of workers to acquire different types of costly <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> with different degrees of associated labor mobility. This part introduces a two-sector general-equilibrium model with production <b>and</b> investments in <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> (i. e. education). Ex-ante identical workers face a trade-off between breadth and depth in the acquisition of industry-specific labor productivity. This chapter derives sufficient conditions for the existence of mobile workers.
