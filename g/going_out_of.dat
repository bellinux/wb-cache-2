5|$|Oldham Borough was {{established}} in 1964 as Oldham Dew FC, and after many years playing {{under the name of}} Oldham Town changed its name to Oldham Boro in 2009, finally becoming known as Oldham Borough just months before it folded. The team played in the North West Counties Football League before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence in 2015, just over 50 years after it was founded.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Journal – in April 1917, on {{the advice}} of John Koren, Speyer had {{provided}} a loan to The Boston Journal newspaper to prevent it from <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. The newspaper had printed some articles of a pro-German nature and the committee thought it imprudent but not disloyal of Speyer to have lent the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Dundee Hibernian in 1909, playing {{from the outset}} at Tannadice Park. They were voted into the Scottish Football League in 1910. After being saved from <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{business}} in October 1923, the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal.|$|E

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their way to burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business.|$|E

5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) {{were some}} of the {{recognized}} musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use in many contexts.|$|E

5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noire went {{straight}} to top of the UK games chart and became the fastest selling new intellectual property in the UK (a record it held until the 2014 release of Watch Dogs). It stayed top of the UK game chart for three weeks. In Australia, video game stores in major cities reported that the game was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> stock after a week. L.A. Noire debuted in Japan for the week of 4–10 July and sold a combined 71,057 units on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 version topped the chart, with 58,436 units sold, and the Xbox 360 version moved 12,621 units.|$|E

A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control on its own, leading it to crash into another car.

5|$|The Celtics {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E
5|$|Ron Vanderlinden {{was hired}} as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped {{engineer}} turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed signs of significant improvement, and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The Terrapins, however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl—a Maryland alumnus was {{the chief executive officer}} of both events. The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds. After the ensuing punt, Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a winning season, Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game. The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.|$|E
5|$|With 7:51 left in {{the game}} and down 17–6, Cutler {{attempted}} to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson {{in the corner of the}} left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds {{left in the}} game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18–17 win.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, La Sombra and Rush were {{involved}} in an incident in Guadalajara, where the two attacked fans who were throwing beers at them. The following day, Jalisco's Boxing and Wrestling Commission suspended the two from wrestling in the state for three months. While the commission only suspended them from wrestling in Jalisco, CMLL decided to pull both La Sombra and Rush from their Super Viernes show three days later. CMLL did not offer an official explanation for the change. Over the summer of 2015 Los Ingobernables started to wrestle against tecnico teams instead of generally facing rudo teams {{as they had been}} up to that point. By August, 2015 Los Ingobernables found themselves facing off against Atlantis on multiple occasions, often with La Sombra <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his way to attack Atlantis, tearing Atlantis' mask apart during matches to show his disdain for the veteran tecnico. On August 19, 2015 CMLL held a press conference where they announced that the winner of the main event of the 80th Anniversary, La Sombra, would put his mask on the line against the winner of the main event of the 81st Anniversary Show, Atlantis, in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show on September 18, 2015. On August 31, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to Último Guerrero, ending his two and a half year reign. La Sombra lost the Lucha de Apuestas match to Atlantis. As a result, La Sombra was forced to unmask and reveal his real name. In early November, La Sombra and Rush began having issues with each other, which led to a singles match between the two on November 13, where Rush was victorious. After the match, {{which turned out to be}} La Sombra's final with CMLL, the two founding members of Los Ingobernables made peace with each other.|$|E

When Uzziah also went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this house for his transgression, he was cast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all society, and made to dwell in a kind of a pest-house, even to the day of his death (2 Chron 26:21).|$|R
