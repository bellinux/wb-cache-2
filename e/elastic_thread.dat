40|$|Connectin is a {{very long}} and {{flexible}} protein of striated muscle, linking myosin filaments to z discs in a sarcomere. Isolated native connectin in solution frequently forms <b>elastic</b> <b>threads</b> upon concentration of the solution, by side-by-side association of molecules. An X-ray diffraction study was performed to examine the presence of ^-sheet structure in artificially prepared <b>threads.</b> The <b>elastic</b> properties of such threads were measured at various temperatures. Negative temperature dependence of the elastic coefficient suggests that the elasticity of connectin threads is due to deformation of the three-dimensional structure and not to rubber-like behavior. Connectin is a long and flexible protein of striated muscle and connects myosin filaments to z discs in a sarcomere (for a review, see Refs. 1 and 2). Circular dichroism data reported recently suggest that connectin consists of about 70 % /S-sheet struc-ture (5). Isolated native connectin frequently forms <b>elastic</b> <b>threads</b> upon concentration of con-nectin solution, and electron microscopic examina-tion revealed long filaments of side-by-side asso-ciated molecules (4) in such a solution.

60|$|Our solar system, as {{has been}} already mentioned, consists, in chief, of one sun and sixteen planets certainly, but in all {{probability}} a few others, revolving around it as a centre, and attended by seventeen moons of which we know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing. These various bodies are not true spheres, but oblate spheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they rotate:—the flattening being {{a consequence of the}} rotation. Neither is the Sun absolutely the centre of the system; for this Sun itself, with all the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity. Neither are we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids move—the moons about the planets, the planets about the Sun, or the Sun about the common centre—as circles in an accurate sense. They are, in fact, ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the revolution is made. An ellipse is a curve, returning into itself, one of whose diameters is longer than the other. In the longer diameter are two points, equidistant {{from the middle of the}} line, and so situated otherwise that if, from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the longer diameter itself. Now let us conceive such an ellipse. At one of the points mentioned, which are the foci, let us fasten an orange. By an <b>elastic</b> <b>thread</b> let us connect this orange with a pea; and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse. Let us now move the pea continuously around the orange—keeping always on the circumference of the ellipse. The <b>elastic</b> <b>thread,</b> which, of course, varies in length as we move the pea, will form what in geometry is called a radius vector. Now, if the orange be understood as the Sun, and the pea as a planet revolving about it, then the revolution should be made at such a rate—with a velocity so varying—that the radius vector may pass over equal areas of space in equal times. The progress of the pea should be—in other words, the progress of the planet is, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance from the Sun—swift in proportion to its proximity. Those planets, moreover, move the more slowly which are the farther from the Sun; the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other, as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} SAS {{design was}} based on two new fabrics: a type of [...] "powernet" [...] (or [...] "girdle fabric") for high-tension areas, and an elastic bobbinet weave for lower-tension areas.

The terms warp and weft are used loosely here, as the material was not woven using traditional means. Powernet used Spandex cord as the warp with nylon cord as the weft, allowing movement primarily along the warp axis. Bobbinet used cotton-wrapped rubber warp and nylon or Dacron weft, and was flexible in both directions. The cotton wrapping limited the maximum stretch to 200% of the rest length.

60|$|The {{construction}} of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, {{like those of the}} Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity {{to the back of the}} bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain <b>elastic</b> <b>threads,</b> and retain the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.|$|R

These procedures were only designed to help women with the then-standard sizes A through D up to a size 38 band size and were {{not intended to be}} used for larger-breasted women. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Other companies like the Model and Fay-Miss (renamed in 1935 as the Bali Brassiere Company) also began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s.

Maidenform introduced brassieres with seamless cups in 1933, but resisted using cup sizes for its products until 1949.|$|E
5000|$|The {{full force}} {{application}} of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield {{and not as a}} sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not {{to be used as a}} cause of action against another. In Combe v Combe 1951 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC 1975 QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action."Early cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for Employment v Globe <b>Elastic</b> <b>Thread</b> Co Ltd 1980 AC 506. The promise or representation must be “precise” and “unambiguous” although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‘waiver’ has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. In Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a [...] "promise" [...] as such, but merely an [...] "understanding". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to [...] "relief against forfeiture" [...] cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases. This case was the one on which Denning placed considerable reliance in the High Trees case. It never applied to situations of part payment of debts, however, under the modern law the concept of waiver has been effectively considered within [...] "promissory estoppel".|$|E

40|$|Arcyria denudata {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Myxomycetes found worldwide. The capillitial threads of this species has a variety of surface ornamentation. Its capillitium has been studied using light and {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM). The capillitium consists of a dense network of branching and anastomosing <b>elastic</b> <b>threads</b> 3 ~ 6 μm in diameter. The capillitial threads are marked with variously shaped protuberances; sometimes these protuberances are spirally arranged around the axis. These protuberances are too small to observe with light microscopy. The fine structure of the surface ornamentation of capillitial threads was observed using SEM as papillae, cogs, rings, half-rings, reticulations and longitudinal striations. The threads with cogs, rings or half-rings formed a network composed of irregular ridges on the surface. Certain threads also had fine warts, fine hollows and fine papillae. Plates were observed at the branching points of the thread. These plates had a network composed of fine ridges on the surface. The capillitial threads sometimes form small loops with cogs and rings. These cogs and rings are often unevenly arranged on the outside of a loop. Arcyria denudata (L.)

60|$|As the bisulphide {{of carbon}} {{has a strong}} power of {{softening}} indurated caoutchouc, I soaked in it during a short time several rootlets of a plant which had grown up a plaistered wall; and I then found many extremely thin threads of transparent, not viscid, excessively elastic matter, precisely like caoutchouc, attached to two sets of rootlets on the same branch. These threads proceeded from the bark of the rootlet at one end, and {{at the other end}} were firmly attached to particles of silex or mortar from the wall.

The genus Ficus abounds with caoutchouc, and we may conclude from the facts just given that this substance, at first in solution and ultimately modified into an unelastic cement, {42} is used by the Ficus repens to cement its rootlets to any surface which it ascends. Whether other plants, which climb by their rootlets, emit any cement I do not know; but the rootlets of the Ivy, placed against glass, barely adhered to it, yet secreted a little yellowish matter.

Also results demonstrate that by increasing the number of tested threads, the elongation value has a higher impact on tensile force. The influence of linear density of elastic PU core on tensile force increases by increasing elongation value of threads. When influence of inlay-yarn linear density and number of threads on tensile force is determined it is possible to predict influence of inlay-yarn properties on compression properties of knitted orthopaedic supports.
