5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E
5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

500|$|Eric Walters of Paste awarded The Flash episode a 9.0 out of 10, stating, [...] ""Flash vs. Arrow" [...] was {{everything}} a fan could have wanted from a crossover event," [...] noting it was [...] "tight, well-paced, superbly written and, most importantly, fun...".

500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> material." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Do 32 first flew on 29 June 1962, {{and much}} flight testing was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{aircraft}} and two further prototypes. The aircraft was also stowed in a trailer, transported, unfolded and flown. The heavy rotor could be spun up [...] before takeoff with zero pitch, containing enough energy for a rapid initial vertical climb or jump start, autogyro fashion. All three were eventually lost in accidents with different causes. Though Dornier had hopes of large Army orders, none followed. Agricultural applications were considered, {{and there was}} a design project for the Do 32Z, a two-seat version with a bigger engine, but no more manned Do 32s flew. The unflown fourth prototype is on display at the Deutsches Museum, painted as the first prototype D-HOPA. The Do 32U was a pilotless version of the Do 32E, very similar, apart from the missing seat. The Do 32K, developed into the Do34, was also an unmanned drone with compressed air-driven rotors, but without a fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{more was}} <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{phenomenon}} until 1856 when German glassblower Heinrich Geissler created a mercury vacuum pump that evacuated a glass tube {{to an extent}} not previously possible. [...] Geissler invented the first gas-discharge lamp, the Geissler tube, consisting of a partially evacuated glass tube with a metal electrode at either end. [...] When a high voltage was applied between the electrodes, {{the inside of the}} tube lit up with a glow discharge. [...] By putting different chemicals inside, the tubes could be made to produce a variety of colors, and elaborate Geissler tubes were sold for entertainment. More important, however, was its contribution to scientific research. One of the first scientists to experiment with a Geissler tube was Julius Plücker who systematically described in 1858 the luminescent effects that occurred in a Geissler tube. He also made the important observation that the glow in the tube shifted position when in proximity to an electromagnetic field. Alexandre Edmond Becquerel observed in 1859 that certain substances gave off light when they were placed in a Geissler tube. He went on to apply thin coatings of luminescent materials to the surfaces of these tubes. Fluorescence occurred, but the tubes were very inefficient and had a short operating life.|$|E

[...] Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine gave it four out of five stars saying, [...] "This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked. Marguerite Bennett and G. Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world. It's easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue an 8.4 out of 10 and said, [...] "While certain details {{regarding}} the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear, A-Force #1 marks a worthy debut for Marvel's newest team book." [...] Eric Diaz of The Nerdist gave it three out of five burritos and wrote, [...] "Overall the issue was fine, and I'm curious to see where it all goes, but I'm far more eager to see what can be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> grouping of [...] awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper." [...] Diaz also noted that, [...] " [...] making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called A-Force." [...] Lan Pitts of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 praising the artwork of Jorge Molina, Laura Martin and Matt Milla.|$|E
