5|$|Michael Schumacher started {{alongside}} Coulthard on {{the front}} row of the grid. Going into the first corner, Häkkinen accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher and Coulthard off the line and overtook both <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> the lead. He managed to maintain his lead until his first pit stop on lap 31. As his teammate Coulthard made his pit stop one lap later, Häkkinen regained the lead which he held to win his third win of the season. Michael Schumacher fended off Coulthard, who challenged him in the later stages despite losing time lapping backmarkers, to take second.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 Webber {{announced}} {{his return to}} sportscar racing, racing for Porsche {{as one of their}} <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> the 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship as the marque returned to the top category of sportscar racing after a 16-year absence. Driving the Porsche 919 Hybrid Webber finished his first World Endurance Championship race in third at the 2014 6 Hours of Silverstone two laps behind the winning Toyota. At Le Mans, although still running at the finish, the team were thirty three laps down and were therefore listed as Not Classified. Two more third-place finishes followed at Fuji and Bahrain. At the 6 Hours of São Paulo, Webber's Porsche took pole position, but was involved in a heavy crash {{towards the end of the}} race whilst passing the Ferrari of the 8 Star Motorsports team. Webber's car split in two, but he avoided serious injury. Webber therefore finished his first season in 9th place.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 Ofcom {{commissioned}} research among {{residents of}} the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to pirate radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were identified as key <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> pirate radio. According to the research both pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently {{for the needs of}} the public at large. Pirate radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.|$|E
5|$|In the 1982 season, Mouton {{finished}} {{a close second}} overall to Walter Röhrl, after wins in Portugal, Brazil and Greece, and helped Audi to its first manufacturers' title. Her campaign the following year resulted in fifth place. With the team having four top <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> 1984, Mouton's participation on world championship level became part-time. In 1985, she won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, setting a record time in the process. In 1986, she moved to Peugeot and won the German Rally Championship as the first female driver {{to win a major}} championship in rallying. Soon after securing the title, Mouton retired from rallying due to the ban of Group B supercars. In 1988, she co-founded the international motorsport event Race of Champions in memory of her former rival Henri Toivonen. Mouton became the first president of the FIA's Women & Motor Sport Commission in 2010 and the FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011.|$|E

5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that none of their cars were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the restart at the beginning of lap 58, Bottas made a move on Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{two hours}} after the court made its initial {{judgment}} in favour of van der Garde, the FIA published an entry list for the Australian Grand Prix that included both Nasr and Ericsson for Sauber following pre-event scrutineering. Despite this, neither driver took to the circuit during the first practice session on the Friday due to Sauber running {{the risk of having}} team assets seized for not complying with court orders. Nevertheless, based on media speculation about Bernie Ecclestone's intervention to avoid further negative publicity on the sport, Ericsson and Nasr did participate in that afternoon's second practice session. On Saturday, 14 March 2015, the dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der Garde announcing that he would forego racing in Melbourne, with a view to finding a more permanent solution in the future. The Sauber team and its new <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> 2015 were thus able to complete Saturday's qualifying session and a point-scoring race on the Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} {{maintain}} his lead from teammate Coulthard. On lap two Herbert moved into fifth position after Irvine dropped to seventh place when Verstappen overtook him. Further down the field Barrichello continued to gain positions when he passed both BAR <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> eighth. The McLaren drivers managed to maintain a gap to Trulli who set the fastest lap of the race, 1:46.321. Irvine lost a further position to Barrichello on lap three, as Frentzen claimed 14th from Diniz. On lap four, Frentzen made up a further position by passing Heidfeld for 13th. On the same lap Verstappen locked up his tyres to avoid a collision with Herbert. This allowed Barrichello to pass Verstappen for sixth position in the run up to the Clark chicane on lap five. Herbert lost fifth position to Barrichello on lap six with Frentzen continuing {{to move up the}} field by passing Ralf Schumacher and Wurz for eleventh. Barrichello began setting consecutive fastest laps as he closed the gap to de la Rosa. Zonta lost 10th position when he was passed by Frentzen on lap seven. On the next lap, Verstappen suffered a worrying moment when half of his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Frentzen managed to gain a further four positions in the next four laps.|$|E
