5|$|Although {{signed by}} Pierce and Santa Anna, the treaty needed a 2/3 {{vote in favor}} of {{ratification}} in the US Senate, where <b>it</b> <b>met</b> strong opposition. Antislavery senators opposed further acquisition of slave territory. Lobbying by speculators gave the treaty a bad reputation. Some senators objected to furnishing Santa Anna financial assistance.|$|E

5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species. Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, <b>it</b> <b>met</b> with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E
5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. <b>It</b> <b>met</b> no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process.

5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing to be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when <b>it</b> <b>met</b> later that year in Rome.|$|E

5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} book before Geisel ran {{into an old}} college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and <b>it</b> <b>met</b> with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the route}} was mostly removed in 2009, it began at Harrison Street, the old routing of SR 86, in Riverside County. It then headed north as Pierce Street until {{intersecting}} 66th Street, where SR 195 turned east. The highway intersected SR 86 {{and continued to}} the town of Mecca, where <b>it</b> <b>met</b> its north end at SR 111. The route loosely paralleled the northern end of the Salton Sea, passing through farmland for its entire length.|$|E

5|$|Fighting was renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1993, as the Croatian army launched Operation Maslenica, an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22. The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area, as it targeted the city airport and the Maslenica Bridge, the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991. The attack proved successful as <b>it</b> <b>met</b> its declared objectives, but at a high cost, as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers were killed in a relatively limited theater of operations.|$|E

When Highway41 was extended north to Pembroke in 1957, Highway60 was routed along it between Golden Lake and Eganville. It was extended east to Highway17 in downtown Renfrew circa 1961. It was extended further east when Highway17 was rerouted around Renfrew in 1977, establishing the current route.|$|E
5|$|In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania died. He was {{the last}} of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of Pomerania. Sweden {{acquired}} the Pomeranian rule, while the Commonwealth was only able to get back its fiefs, Bytów Land and Lębork Land. Słupsk Land was also sought by Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of Pomerania adjacent to the border of the Commonwealth, extending south to where <b>it</b> <b>met</b> with Habsburg lands.

On 1 November 1988, Federal Councillor Arnold Koller signed the dissolution order, and the AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss nuclear weapons program.|$|E
