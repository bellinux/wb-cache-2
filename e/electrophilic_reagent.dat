40|$|The {{activation}} of relatively unreactive carbon-carbon (C-C) multiple bonds {{is an important}} tool for the introduction of functional groups and stereochemical information in organic molecules. In recent years, the use of electrophilic cationic gold(I) complexes for the functionalization of alkynes and allenes has seen rapid development. An especially general application of gold catalysis is the nucleophilic trapping of gold-activated ð bond to give a heterocyclic compound. In the case of allenes, chiral ligands {{have been used to}} generate product with excellent enantiocontrol. In {{the first part of this}} Thesis we report studies on the development of an enantioselective cyclization using the gold-catalyzed transformation of propargyl esters to generate allenes in situ. A subsequent gold-catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric cyclization of a phenol onto the allene resulted in the generation of enantioenriched cyclized chromanone derivatives from racemic starting material. The optimal catalyst for this transformation was a (biscarbene) digold(I) complex, which delivered better enantioselectivities than previously known phosphine-gold and phosphoramidite-gold complexes. Electrophilic sources of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) activate C-C multiple bonds in much the same way as gold(I) complexes, but the electrophilic atom of the reagent is incorporated into the final product. Because halogen atoms are amenable to further functional group manipulation and are also present in complex natural products, the enantioselective synthesis of halofunctionalized products from alkenes is an important synthetic goal. Typically, enantioselectivity is achieved using a chiral catalyst to activate the <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagent.</b> However, high enantioselectivities may be hampered by uncatalyzed background reactivity. The Toste research group has introduced a new approach for electrophilic functionalization (chiral anion phase transfer catalysis) by inducing ion pairing between a phosphate anion chiral source and a cationic <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagent</b> by phase transfer. This concept was initially demonstrated for fluorination, using the cationic reagent F-TEDA-BF 4 (Selectfluor®). In the second part of the Thesis, we report studies on the extension of this strategy to the heavier halogens. With the successful development of bromination and iodination reagents suitable for chiral anion phase transfer, we applied these reagents to the synthesis of halogenated benzoxazines with high levels of enantioselectivity...|$|E

This so-called Staudinger ligation has been employed {{in a wide range}} of applications as a general tool for bioconjugation including specific labeling of nucleic acids. Results A new approach for the preparation of labeled nucleosides via intermolecular Staudinger ligation is described. Reaction of azidonucleosides with triphenylphosphine lead to iminophosphorane intermediates, which react subsequently with derivatives of coumarin or ferrocene to form coumarin or ferrocene labeled nucleosides. Fluorescent properties of coumarin labeled nucleosides are determined. Conclusion New coumarin and ferrocene labeled nucleosides were prepared via intermolecular Staudinger ligation. This reaction joins the fluorescent coumarin and biospecific nucleoside to the new molecule with promising fluorescent and electrochemical properties. The isolated yields of products depend on the structure of azidonucleoside and carboxylic acids.

40|$|Basic {{properties}} of cuboctahedral Pd-Pb clusters ranging from 13 to 116 atoms were studied by computational analysis, {{and the effects}} of doped Pb atoms on Pd clusters were investigated. The average bond length of Pd-Pb clusters was found to be similar to 0. 1 A longer than pure ones, but doped Pb atoms did not constantly expand the Pd-Pd bond lengths in Pd-Pb clusters owing to size effect. In addition, doped Pb atom changed the thickness of surface phase and surface morphology of Pd cluster. The chemical activity of Pd clusters could be enhanced by the doped Pd atoms, although an enough size was required. Lead atoms essentially changed the surface charge population of Pd clusters. The Pd atoms in Pd-Pb clusters were seen to become more electrophilic than in pure Pd clusters, and the probability of being attacked by nucleophilic reagent could be comparable with that of being attacked by <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagent.</b> Total electron density and deformation electron density revealed that the nature of interaction between metal atoms was metal bond.

Chapter one of the thesis is {{a review of the}} relevant chemistry of the compounds: their synthesis and key transformations. In chapter two, new research on 3 (2 H) -furanones is outlined in two parts. The first describes an investigation into the cyclisation of α'-trialkylsilyloxyenone adducts with arenesulfenyl and selenenyl chlorides into the corresponding sulfur and selenium substituted 3 (2 H) -furanones without the involvement of a Lewis acid catalyst. The study, largely involving in situ NMR techniques, identified key features associated with the formation and reaction of the chlorosulfide and chloroselenide intermediates, including operation of the Thorpe-Ingold effect.

40|$|International audienceStatistical copoly(ionic liquid) s (coPILs), namely, poly(styrene) -co-poly(4 -vinylbenzylethylimidazolium acetate) are {{synthesized}} by free-radical copolymerization in methanolic solution. These coPILs {{serve to}} in situ generate polymer-supported N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), {{referred to as}} polyNHCs, due to the noninnocent role of the weakly basic acetate counteranion interacting with the proton in C 2 -position of pendant imidazolium rings. Formation of polyNHCs is first evidenced through the quantitative formation of NHC-CS 2 units by chemical postmodification of acetate-containing coPILs, {{in the presence of}} CS 2 as <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagent</b> (= stoichiometric functionalization of polyNHCs). The same coPILs are also employed as masked precursors of polyNHCs in organocatalyzed reactions, including a one-pot two-step sequential reaction involving benzoin condensation followed by addition of methyl acrylate, cyanosilylation, and transesterification reactions. The catalytic activity can be switched on and off successively upon thermal activation, thanks to the deprotonation/ reprotonation equilibrium in C 2 -position. NHC species are thus in situ released upon heating at 80 degrees C (deprotonation), while regeneration of the coPIL precursor occurs at room temperature (reprotonation), triggering its precipitation in tetrahydrofuran. This also allows recycling the coPIL precatalyst by simple filtration, and reusing it for further catalytic cycles. The different organocatalyzed reactions tested can thus be performed with excellent yields after several cycles...|$|E

The peroxide-oxidized C 165 S mutant of AhpC incubated with NBD-Cl gave a product with an absorbance maximum at 347 nm, whereas the thiol-NBD conjugate formed from the reduced protein absorbed maximally at 420 nm. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the modified proteins allowed identification of the species absorbing at 347 nm as a Cys-S(O) -NBD derivative containing one additional oxygen relative to the Cys-S-NBD product. The C 165 S conjugates with Cys-S(O) -NBD and Cys-S-NBD had no peroxidase activity when compared to unreacted C 165 S and wild-type AhpC, but were both reactivated through removal of NBD by DTT. Oxidized C 165 S was also modified by dimedone, a common sulfenic acid reagent, to give the expected inactivated conjugate of higher mass. This reagent was not removed by DTT and blocked any further reaction of the protein with NBD-Cl.
