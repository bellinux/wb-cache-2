50|$|Two {{pairs of}} magnets are placed {{back to back}} on a {{suspension}} strip making a balanced system with a magnetic field at each end. When a sample, which is fixed in a glass tube holder, is introduced into the field of one magnet, that magnet experiences a force which deflects the beam. The deflection is detected by an optical transducer. A magnetic field is generated at the second magnet which, by negative feedback, restores the beam to its original position. The magnetic field required {{to do that is}} generated by passing a current through a coil of wire. One end of that wire is between the poles of the second magnet. The current required to do this is proportional to the force exerted on the first magnet. There is a second coil of wire that creates an <b>electrical</b> <b>zero</b> and a copper sheet that can critically dampen the system.|$|E
5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>zero</b> position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|E

It wasn’t until 1957 that a theory successfully described this phenomenon. Electrons {{are able to}} conduct with <b>zero</b> <b>electrical</b> resistance by binding into pairs, named Cooper pairs. In conventional superconductors (with Tc below ~ 30 K), Cooper pairs are formed when the electrons interact with vibrations of the crystal lattice, phonons.

A primary goal in the study of high-temperature superconductivity is to determine this pairing mechanism and to further understand the magnetic and electronic phases of these materials. Neutron scattering was used to study magnetic excitations in the high-temperature superconductor HgBa 2 CuO 4 +δ (Hg 1201). Such excitations are a candidate for the pairing mechanism.
