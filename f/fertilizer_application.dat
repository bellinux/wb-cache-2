25|$|Rice pests are any organisms or {{microbes}} {{with the}} potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds). Rice pests include weeds, pathogens, insects, nematode, rodents, and birds. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including climatic factors, improper irrigation, the overuse of insecticides and high rates of nitrogen <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application.</b> Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice gall midge and army worm outbreaks tend to follow periods of high rainfall early in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.|$|E

This study aims determining economic feasibility of organic greenhouse lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in an on farm trial, to foster organic greenhouse vegetable production in the preservation area of Tahtali Dam, projected as the sole water resource of Izmir, Turkey’s third largest. A 384 m 2 greenhouse, constructed of galvanized metal tubing anchored {{and covered with a}} polyethylene was analyzed to identify typical operation procedures, and to determine unitary construction and operation cost. Organic lettuces were produced during autumn season of 2001 - 2002, testing different organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications,</b> including two rates of farmyard and poultry manure (30 and 50 t ha- 1) with and without two organic fertilizers based on either bacteria or algae.

40|$|Throughout {{the world}} {{there is a}} trend towards {{retaining}} crop residues rather than burning them. For this reason, changes in soil chemistry and aggregation in a Vertisol induced by 59 years of burning or green cane harvesting with or without annual <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> were investigated. Crop residues were either burnt prior to harvest with the harvest residues raked off (R- 1), burnt prior to harvest with the harvest residues left on the soil surface (R- 2) or left unburnt with all the trash left on the soil surface (R- 3) Concentrations of organic C in the surface 10 cm of soil increased with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> and with increasing amounts of crop residue returned in the order R- 1 < R- 2 < R- 3. <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> caused an accumulation of residual P in both inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) forms. A sequential P fractionation showed that fertilizer P accumulated in both labile and recalcitrant Pi and Po forms, and trash retention caused an accumulation of recalcitrant Po. Concentrations of K decreased in the unfertilized R- 1 and R- 2 treatments because K reserves were depleted. By contrast, {{there was an increase}} in the concentrations of K in the fertilized R- 3 treatment. The soil became more acid on the fertilized and, to a lesser extent, trash retention plots. We attribute this to nitrification and subsequent nitrate leaching. Acidification resulted in a loss of exchangeable Ca and Mg, a decrease in ECEC, and an increase in the concentrations of total and monomeric Al in soil solution, in exchangeable Al 3 + and in the buffering reserve of non-exchangeable Al associated with organic matter. Aggregate stability was increased by increasing crop residues but decreased by <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications.</b> The decrease was attributed to an increase in the proportion of exchangeable cations present in monovalent form due to <b>applications</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> K and leaching of Ca and Mg. We conclude that trash retention and annual <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> have substantial long-term effects on both organic matter status and soil pH and therefore on other soil chemical and physical properties...|$|R
