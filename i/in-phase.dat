5|$|Tracking west-northwestward {{and then}} westward along the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Mekkhala was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on January 15, due to its slightly improved structure. Mekkhala quickly intensified {{on the next day}} due to improved conditions; the wind shear became <b>in-phase</b> with the storm's motion while the robust divergent outflow persisted. Therefore, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at 06:00UTC on January16, and later that day the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon, when a central dense overcast has significantly deepened and totally obscured the LLCC. Later, a microwave imagery revealed that Mekkhala formed a ragged eyewall structure. The system reached peak intensity at 00:00UTC on January 17 with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph), although operationally the JMA estimated typhoon-force winds of 130km/h (80mph).|$|E
25|$|According to GLONASS developers, {{there will}} be three open and two {{restricted}} CDMA signals. The open signal L3OC is centered at 1202.025MHz and uses BPSK(10) modulation for both data and pilot channels; the ranging code transmits at 10.23 million chips per second, modulated onto the carrier frequency using QPSK with <b>in-phase</b> data and quadrature pilot. The data is error-coded with 5-bit Barker code and the pilot with 10-bit Neuman-Hoffman code.|$|E
25|$|The B80 boron cluster {{occupies}} the large space between four supericosahedra {{as described in}} the REB66 section. On the other hand, the 2-dimensional supericosahedron networks in the Sc4.5–xB57–y+zC3.5–z crystal structure stack <b>in-phase</b> along the z-axis. Instead of the B80 cluster, a pair of the I2 icosahedra fills the open space staying within the supericosahedron network, as shown in figure 28 where the icosahedron I2 is colored in yellow.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} length associated with sound power is αL, {{the position of}} the gauze. The characteristic speed must be the convection speed u at the heat source. For detailed study of the whistle, see Matveev. Since the first mode resonance is about half-wave, the sound field emitted from the tube is from two <b>in-phase</b> monopole-like sources, one at either end. A gas flame inside a tube can drive resonance; it was called a singing flame. There is a reverse Rijke Tube when hot air passes through a cold grid.|$|E
25|$|One simple {{combination}} is two simple sources {{separated by a}} distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair {{is known as a}} doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this {{combination is}} similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting <b>in-phase</b> monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.|$|E
500|$|Applications of {{the hybrid}} include {{monopulse}} comparators, mixers, power combiners, dividers, modulators, and phased array radar antenna systems. [...] Both <b>in-phase</b> devices (such as the Wilkinson divider) and quadrature (90°) hybrid couplers {{may be used}} for coherent power divider applications. [...] An example of quadrature hybrids being used in a coherent power combiner application is given in the next section.|$|E
500|$|The {{phases of}} the inputs to each power {{combiner}} are arranged such that the two inputs are 90° out of phase with each other. [...] Since the coupled port of a hybrid combiner is 90° out of phase with the transmitted port, this causes the powers to add at {{the output of the}} combiner and to cancel at the isolated port: a representative example from figure 21 is shown in figure 22. [...] Note that there is an additional fixed 90° phase shift to both ports at each combiner/divider which is not shown in the diagrams for simplicity. [...] Applying <b>in-phase</b> power to both input ports would not get the desired result: the quadrature sum of the two inputs would appear at both output ports – that is half the total power out of each. [...] This approach allows the use of numerous less expensive and lower-power amplifiers in the circuitry instead of a single high-power TWT. [...] Yet another approach is to have each solid state amplifier (SSA) feed an antenna and let the power be combined in space or be used to feed a lens attached to an antenna.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} HKB model experiments, {{subjects}} were asked to wave one finger on each hand in two modes of direction: first, known as out of phase, both fingers moving in the same direction back and forth (as windshield wipers might move); and second, known as <b>in-phase,</b> where both fingers come together and move away to and from the midline of the body. [...] To illustrate coordination dynamics, the {{subjects were asked}} to move their fingers out of phase with increasing speed until their fingers were moving as fast as possible. [...] As movement approached its critical speed, the subjects’ fingers were found to move from out-of-phase (windshield-wiper-like) movement to <b>in-phase</b> (toward midline movement).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, the HKB model {{has become a}} widely {{accepted}} theory to explain the coordinated movements and behaviors of individual neurons into large, end-to-end neural networks. [...] Originally the model described {{a system in which}} spontaneous transitions observed in finger movements could be described as a series of <b>in-phase</b> and out-of-phase movements.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, {{harmonics}} (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) {{have the}} property of being <b>in-phase</b> when compared line-to-line. In a delta-wye transformer, these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater resistive heating. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they {{will result in a}} non-zero current in the neutral wire. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, near Monterey, California, at 1474 metres depth, an ROV filmed {{a female}} ceratioid {{anglerfish}} {{of the genus}} Oneirodes for 24 minutes. When approached, the fish retreated rapidly, but in 74% of the video footage, it drifted passively, oriented at any angle. When advancing, it swam intermittently at a speed of 0.24 body lengths per second, beating its pectoral fins <b>in-phase.</b> The lethargic behaviour of this ambush predator is suited to the energy-poor environment of the deep sea.|$|E
2500|$|After {{absorbing}} short-wavelength light, {{there is}} short interval {{of time when}} the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted <b>in-phase</b> with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass [...] emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a ruby laser in this way produces a very high intensity of coherent red light.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} this {{behavior}} was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called entrainment or mode locking in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums {{have been used in}} clocks and were widely used in gravimeters in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of <b>in-phase</b> synchronization, as well as [...] "death" [...] states wherein one or both clocks stops.|$|E
2500|$|While gaits can be {{classified}} by footfall, new work involving whole-body kinematics and force-plate records {{has given rise to}} an alternative classification scheme, based on the mechanics of the movement. [...] In this scheme, movements are divided into walking and running. [...] Walking gaits are all characterized by a 'vaulting' movement of the body over the legs, frequently described as an inverted pendulum (displaying fluctuations in kinetic and potential energy which are perfectly out of phase). [...] In running, the kinetic and potential energy fluctuate <b>in-phase,</b> and the energy change is passed on to muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments acting as springs (thus it is described by the spring-mass model).|$|E
2500|$|Methane is a {{tetrahedral}} molecule {{with four}} equivalent C–H bonds. Its electronic structure {{is described by}} four bonding molecular orbitals (MOs) resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on C and H. The lowest energy MO {{is the result of}} the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the <b>in-phase</b> combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms. Above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of MOs that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen. The resulting [...] "three-over-one" [...] bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements.|$|E
2500|$|In {{classical}} optics, {{light is}} {{thought of as}} electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is thought of as light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being <b>in-phase</b> with another is not valid in quantum theory. [...] Laser radiation is produced in a resonant cavity where the resonant frequency of the cavity {{is the same as}} the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. [...] As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. [...] That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some non-linear effects limit it. [...] As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. [...] See Fig.1) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, {{meaning it}} is stronger aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures. [...] This is explained by the thermal wind relationship. [...] It also means that a pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. [...] If both an upper tropospheric cold-core low and lower tropospheric easterly wave trough are <b>in-phase,</b> with the easterly wave near or to the east of the upper level cyclone, thunderstorm development (also known as moist convection) is enhanced. [...] If they are out-of-phase, with the tropical wave west of the upper level circulation, convection is suppressed due to convergence aloft leading to downward motion over the tropical wave or surface trough in the easterlies. [...] Upper level cyclones also interact with troughs in the subtropical westerlies, such as cold fronts and stationary fronts. [...] When the subtropical disturbances in the Northern Hemisphere actively move southward, or dig, the area between the upper tropospheric anticyclone to its west and cold-core low to its east generally have strong northeasterly winds in addition to a rapid development of active thunderstorm activity. [...] Cloud bands associated with upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices are aligned with the vertical wind shear. [...] Animated satellite cloud imagery is a better tool for their early detection and tracking. [...] The low-level convergence caused by the cut-off low can trigger squall lines and rough seas, and the low-level spiral cloud bands caused by the upper level circulation are parallel to the low-level wind direction. [...] This has also been witnessed with upper level lows which occur at higher latitudes. [...] For example, in areas where small-scale snow bands develop within the cold sector of extratropical cyclones.|$|E

This shows the {{points in the}} complex plane where, in this context, the real and imaginary axes are termed the <b>in-phase</b> and quadrature axes respectively due to their 90° separation. Such a representation on perpendicular axes lends itself to straightforward implementation. The amplitude of each point along the <b>in-phase</b> axis is used to modulate a cosine (or sine) wave and the amplitude along the quadrature axis to modulate a sine (or cosine) wave.
