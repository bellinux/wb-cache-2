40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} effect of {{environmental}} conditioning and geometric parameters {{on the performance of}} the T-peel test. Finite element analyses were performed to establish the effects of these parameters on joint performance and stress distribution within the adhesive layer. The finite element models presented in this report were constructed and solved using the ABAQUS program with FEMGV as the pre-processor. The analyses were based on experimental data generated within the DTI funded ADH and PAJ programmes. The effect of environmental conditioning on the joint performance was investigated using a sequentially coupled mechanical-diffusion finite element model, which incorporated continuously varying adhesive material properties. The numerical predictions revealed that the stress distributions become more uniform along the adhesive layer when the adhesive contains increased amounts of moisture. Peel stresses {{at the edge of the}} adhesive fillet decrease with increasing moisture content. Parametric studies on the specimen geometry revealed that stress distributions are sensitive to adherend material properties, adherend thickness and <b>flange</b> <b>radius,</b> the <b>flange</b> <b>radius</b> is the least significant. In general, stresses were reduced when changes in the T-peel geometry resulted in smaller join...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the problem}} of bending process is the final product {{dimension}} that it is not agree with the expected results. To reduce trial and error of parametersdesign, designers can utilize computer simulations to predict parameter process virtually and more time-saving analysis. The aim of this study is determine the variations effect of initial blank material thickness to the flange flatness of the final product in the jogged flange process. In order to find the influence on the uneveness of the flange bend, the parameters of plate thickness, <b>flange</b> <b>radius</b> ratio, and flange length ratio are selected. Verification models were created to justify the trend data between modeling and the experimental results. From the result, the elevation difference on uneveness of the flange bendwas obtained. For initial blank material thickness dimensions, {{it can be seen that}} the minimum value of the uneveness defect can be obtained by using equal of plate area ratio. The observed increase of the <b>flange</b> <b>radius</b> could be attribute to decrease of uneveness of the flange bend. The increase of plate thickness, uneveness of the flange bend will be decrease...|$|E

After the model's deducing of the relative strain degrees of the external and inner ring of the cup with flange and the calculation of their values, diagrams will be drawn on which {{it can be seen}} that they are not mutually equal during the process. That is going to show that in the case of the first operation the process of deep drawing is non- stationary...|$|E
40|$|Estimating the {{magnitude}} of the pressure reflection coefficient |R| and the end correction l at the open end of ducts is a critical procedure when designing or predicting the acoustic behavior of acoustical systems, such as exhausts, tailpipes, mufflers, loudspeaker enclosures and so on. For cylindrical ducts and plane waves, exact intricate solutions exist for two distinct open-end boundary conditions, namely for a thin-walled unflanged pipe and for a pipe terminated by an infinite flange. This work provides simple approximate expressions for |R| and l of cylindrical pipes terminated by circular <b>flanges</b> with finite <b>radii.</b> The expressions are obtained from a polynomial fit performed over the numerical results provided by a Boundary Element model, and is valid for Helmholtz numbers in the range 0 < ka < 3. 0, as well as for 0 < a/b < 1, where a and b are the pipe and <b>flange</b> <b>radii,</b> respectively. When compared with the exact solutions for both the unflanged and the infinite-flanged pipe, the approximate formulae provide a maximum error of ~ 2 % at the upper frequency limit (ka &# 8594; 3. 0) ...|$|R
5000|$|Several factors affect these {{stiffnesses}} {{to varying}} degrees. These include wheel radius, rim bending and torsional stiffness, number of spokes, spoke gauge, lacing pattern, hub stiffness, hub <b>flange</b> spacing, hub <b>radius.</b> In general lateral and radial stiffness decreases {{with the number}} of spoke crossings and torsional stiffness increases {{with the number of}} spoke crossings. One factor that has little influence on these stiffnesses is spoke tension.|$|R
40|$|Production of {{cylindrical}} cups {{is one of}} {{the most}} important deep drawing processes. However, the process has some noticeable defects such as wrinkling, tearing, spring back, and thickness variation in different locations of produced cups. In this research the parameters of interest are punch/die shoulder radius, blank holder force, friction between sheet and die/punch/holder. To make the simulations ABAQUS finite element software, and to study the effects of these parameters, Taguchi method are used. To verify the study’s simulation results, experimental tests have been carried out. Studied locations include <b>flange,</b> die <b>radius</b> shoulder, wall thickness, punch radius shoulder, punch radius, the bottom of the cups. Also By applying Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method the significance and magnitude of each parameter in determining the thickness in previously given locations are calculated in percentage. Finally, to get the initial blank thickness in different locations the optimum level of parameters is calculated...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of bicycle wheels, there has been very few design changes because the current design is known to work. This study aimed to develop a method to provide {{optimised}} spoking geometries for rear bicycle wheels. MATLAB® was used to optimise the spoke geometries based on the best combination of torsional and lateral stiffness. The developed script can be easily adapted to calculate the optimised geometry for any wheel with tensioned spokes. The load responses of the optimised wheels were then compared with conventional 2 X and 3 X spoke patterns and three commercially available wheels using ANSYS® FEA software. When the optimised geometries were simulated in ANSYS® under torsional, radial and lateral loads, their performance was better than the conventionally spoked and commercial wheels that had similar specifications. These results confirmed that wheel design can be improved. The recommended guidelines produced in this study only apply to the wheel geometries contain herein, as certain limits were imposed on the hub <b>flange</b> <b>radius</b> and the spoke diameters. Limitations on the use of existing theoretical models have also been identified. ...|$|E
40|$|First-generation {{sheeting}} is sheeting without longitudinal and transversal stiffeners. For {{the prediction}} of failure of this sheeting type, if loaded by j concentrated load and bending moment, several theoretical models and design codes exist. One of these theoretical models was developed recently and predicts failure by using a derivative of the web-crippling deformation due to the concentrated load as an imperfection for the compressed flange for which the behaviour is predicted by Marguerre's simultaneous differential plate equations. The quality of the model has been checked with {{a whole range of}} experiments, however, the experiments did not have such a variation of variables that the model could be checked systematically. In this paper, a FE model is used to predict failure for a systematic variation of sheeting variables and the failure loads are used to check the theoretical model. For varying web width, angle between web and <b>flange,</b> corner <b>radius,</b> yield strength, plate thickness, and span length, the theoretical model performs well, qualitatively and quantitatively, compared to the finite element model. For the compressed flange width and load bearing plate width, the theoretical model results show some divergence from the FE model results, although absolute differences remain acceptable...|$|R
40|$|A Solid State Neutral Particle Analyzer (SSNPA) array {{has been}} {{installed}} on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). The array consists of four chords viewing through a common vacuum <b>flange.</b> The tangency <b>radii</b> of the viewing chords are 60, 90, 100, and 120 cm. They view across the three co-injection neutral beam lines (deuterium, 80 keV (typ.) with tangency radii 48. 7, 59. 2, and 69. 4 cm) on NSTX and detect co-going energetic ions. A silicon photodiode used was calibrated by using a mono-energetic deuteron beam source. Deuterons with energy above 40 keV can be detected with the present setup. The degradation of the performance was also investigated. Lead shots and epoxy are used for neutron shielding to reduce handling any hazardous heavy metal. This method also enables us to make an arbitrary shape to be fit into the complex flight tube...|$|R
40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{is one of}} the major forming {{processes}} adopted for manufacturing of thin walled components (thickness < 3 mm) in aerospace and automobile industry. The final form and dimensions of the sheet metal components are affected by several factors such as material characteristics, thickness, bend <b>radius,</b> <b>flange</b> length, spring back, etc,. Among these, spring back is considered to be the major factor affecting the bend angle on the component. Thus, to achieve the nominal bend angle, it is necessary to predict the bend angle on the form tool with due consideration given to spring back. This work proposes a relation for the bend angle on the form tool with respect to the nominal bend angle on the component for a given sheet thickness and material. The relation was verified for Al 2024 alloy sheet metal components of thickness ranging between 1 - 2 mm, and the results were found to be very encouraging...|$|R
500|$|Like Probactrosaurus, the {{scapular}} {{blade of}} Eolambia is nearly rectangular, with {{the sides of}} the blade being straight and meeting the end of the blade at an almost-right angle. The humerus is bowed towards the midline, and the deltopectoral crest on the humerus is prominently thickened. A knob is present on the outer surface of the joint with the radius on the humerus. Both the ulna and the radius are relatively straight bones. The top of the ulna bears three [...] "prongs", namely the olecranon process and two additional triangular <b>flanges.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>radius</b> bears a flattened inner surface at the top end, and a distinct platform on the inner surface at the bottom end, both for articulating with the ulna. The hand has five digits. Among the metacarpal bones of the hand, the second is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. Like Iguanodon, Probactrosaurus, and other basal iguanodonts, the claw on the first digit is distinctively conical. The second and third claws are hoof-like, with the third claw bearing roughened flanges on its sides – a trait also shared with other iguanodonts.|$|R
40|$|Tbe study {{consists}} of an experimental and analytical investigation into the lateral buckling behaviour of steel I-section girders braced by continuous or discrete U-frames. Scaled down laboratory tests on twin I-section girders {{have been carried out}} under full instrumentation and are reported. Lateral deflection of the compression flanges and final buckling modes were recorded and the coupling effect of U-frame action is clearly demonstrated. The failure loads obtained were generally higher than the corresponding design values according to BS 5400. Using a large displacement elasto-plastic finite element package, ABAQUS, finite element idealisations of the tests were established and analysed. Good correlation between the experiments and the numerical analyses was reached. Validity of the ABAQUS package was confirmed and first order elements were sufficiently effective for the analysis. This was followed by further investigation of a wider range of I-section girders using ABAQUS. The ultimate bending resistance of the girders obtained from finite element analysis was in general greater than the corresponding design values to BS 5400, particularly so with girders of high slendemess. Thus the present design method is considered to be unduly conservative. The cause of this conservatism in BS 5400 is discussed. The expression for the calculation of effective length of U-frame braced girders was found to be reasonable. Based on the results from ABAQUS and reviews of the limited research directly related to this study, two main parameters in the BS 5400 expression for beam slenderness seem inappropriate for lateral buckling of an I-section girder under U-frame restraint. These are the radius of gyration of the whole girder section and the ratio of overall depth of a girder to mean <b>flange</b> thickness. Instead, <b>radius</b> of gyration of the compression flange together with a contribution from the adjoining web section was found to be more appropriate as also was the web slenderness. In addition, a modification is proposed to the present limiting stress curve for lateral buckling of bare steel I-section girders. Empirically derived factors have been introduced. The general procedures in the existing design method to BS 5400 remain similar, however. ...|$|R
