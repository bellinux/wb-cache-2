40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Traditionally, <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> compounds (DMCs) {{have been based on}} unsaturated polyester resins (UPR), fillers and glass fibre reinforcements. Such systems however are inflammable and will emit dense, toxic smoke on combustion. Phenolic resins, on the other hand, have excellent flame retardant properties, but slightly inferior mechanical properties. Phenolic DMCs are based on mineral fillers and glass fibre reinforcements, compounded into a phenolic resol (heat cure) resin. Compounding these systems using a co-rotating twin screw extruder, instead of the traditional method using a Z-blade mixer, results in long fibre DMCs which have better mechanical properties than short fibre DMCs. In this study, a wide range of inorganic materials, their pH being one of the selection factors, have been investigated as potential phenolic DMC fillers. Viscosity measurements were carried out on resin/filler mixtures, while on the cured samples flexural and impact properties were investigated. Producing DMCs using a twin screw compounder, the effects of filler loading, types of glass fibre, glass fibre loading and machine output on flexural and impact properties were investigated.

40|$|The {{problems}} associated with x-ray-transparent denture base are defined and conventional approaches to their solution are assessed. Consideration of elemental absorption parameters leads to the postulation that atoms such as zinc, and bromine, may be effective radiopacifiers over {{at least part of}} the clinical x-ray spectrum. These elements had hitherto been considered too light to be effective. Investigation of copolymers of methylmethacrylate and p-bromostyrene revealed no deleterious effects arising from the aromatically brominated monomer (aliphatic bromination caused UV destabilisation). For effective x-ray absorption a higher level of bromination would be necessary, but the expense of suitable compounds made further study unjustifiable. Incorporation of zinc atoms into the polymer was accomplished by copolymerisation of zinc acrylate with methylmethacrylate in solution. At high zinc levels this produced a powder copolymer convenient for addition to dental polymers in the <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> process. The resulting mouldings showed increasing brittleness at high loadings of copolymer. Fracture was shown to be through the powder particles rather than around them, indicating the source of weakness to be in the internal structure of the copolymer. The copolymer was expected to be cross-linked through divalent zinc ions and its insolubility and infusibility supported this. Cleavage of the ionic cross links with formic acid produced a zinc-free linear copolymer of high molecular weight. Addition of low concentrations of acrylic acid to the <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> monomer appeared to 'labilise' the cross links producing a more homogeneous moulding with adequate wet strength. Toxicologically the zinc-containing materials are satisfactory and though zinc is extracted at a measurable rate in an aqueous system, this is very small and should be acceptable over the life of a denture. In other respects the composite is quite satisfactory and though a marketable product is not claimed the system is considered worthy of further study...|$|E

This research investigated manufacturing process {{of a series of}} {{ceramic moulding}} compounds that could be moulded at modest temperature(~ 150 °C) and pressure. The process replicates the polymer <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> compounds as fibre reinforced polymeric moulding composites(FRP). The conventional polymeric matrix of the DMC {{has been replaced by a}} soluble metal silicates based on an inorganic system which can be compounded with fibres, minerals or synthetic fillers and hardening additives to produce a thick paste or a doughy substance(ceramic DMC/CDMC).

The mechanical properties of the compounds have been tested and additional formulation changes have been introduced to maintain desirable processing characteristics [...] ...|$|E

The AGE-starch was hydrolyzed with α-amylase under neutral condition for 6 h at 45 °C for improved process ability. The grafting and hydrolytic scission was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), respectively. Homogeneous composite premixes of AGE-starch, wood fibers, various amount of glycerol and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate were successfully mixed with a Brabender-kneader at 55 °C and cured by compression molding at 150 °C using 2 wt% of dibenzoyl peroxide. Adding 5 wt% of glycerol did not reduce the ultimate strength of the composites; 10 % glycerol reduced the strength from 60 MPa to 40 MPa, and 16 % glycerol to 14 MPa. The results with 5 wt% glycerol are comparable with earlier achieved results. The water absorption rate increased with increased glycerol content and the mechanical strength of the composites was lost completely when the moisture uptake reached 15 wt%...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the characterisation and reuse of fibres recovered from end of life thermoset composites by fluidised bed thermal processing. Emphasis is placed on the properties of recovered glass fibres and their reuse in a <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> compound and a tissue product. The need for a recycling process is demonstrated by a survey of the market for thermoset composites with particular consideration given to the potential growth in automotive applications. A study of processes developed to recycle such materials and the effect on the structural properties of composites containing such recyclate shows that a process capable of generating recyclate of greater value is required, particularly for the case of contaminated materials. A review of investigations into the effect of prior heat treatment on the mechanical properties of glass fibres shows that their strength will be reduced by a deterioration of the fibre surface during fluidised bed thermal recovery but that their stiffness is likely to be unaffected. The implications of these effects on possible applications for the recovered fibres are described. Tests are reported on the structural properties of laminates containing heat treated glass cloth which show that there is a strength reduction which is both time and temperature dependent but that modulus is not significantly affected. Strength loss increases with up to 20 minutes heating but then remains constant. In some cases the strength loss can be reduced by resizing the cloth. Measurement of the properties of fibres recovered using the fluidised bed process shows that the recovered fibre strength decreases with increasing processing temperature. Glass and carbon fibres recovered at 450 °C retain approximately 50 % and 80 % of their virgin strengths respectively. The Young's modulus of the recovered fibres is shown to be largely unaffected by the process for both glass and carbon fibres. Investigation of the lengths of the recovered glass fibres by image analysis techniques suggests that their distribution depends on the structure of the composite and the method of size reduction. A weighted mean fibre length of 3. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm is possible with the apparatus described in this thesis. The reduced reinforcement potential of the recovered fibres is confirmed by experiment. Recovered glass fibres are used to displace virgin fibres in a <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> compound. At replacement levels of up to 50 % there is no significant effect on the mechanical properties of a compression moulded plate. Above this level, tensile, flexural and impact strengths are reduced and with complete replacement the reduction is by approximately 40 %, 50 % and 70 % respectively. These results are confirmed on a pilot plant scale. Recovered glass fibres can be successfully incorporated with virgin fibres into a veil. Replacement of virgin fibres reduces both wet and dry strength because the recovered fibres are both shorter and weaker. The permeability of the veil is found to depend on its porosity and not its recovered fibre content. The experimental veils can be used to protect and improve the surfaces of mouldings...|$|E
40|$|PhDCeramic {{materials}} have considerable attraction {{for use in}} applications where the service temperatures are high and where fire performance and non-combustibility are important. Unfortunately most monolithic ceramic materials are extremely brittle which limits their use for structural applications. The development of fibre and particulate reinforced ceramic composites provides a route to achieving increased toughness in the materials, although this is often {{at the expense of}} ultimate strengths and/or the process-ability of the materials. Many reinforcing fibres used with ceramics are inherently expensive and manufacturing routes to produce fibre reinforced materials can involve high processing temperatures and are consequently expensive. A key goal of this research therefore is to develop a new type of ceramic matrix composites that combine toughness, strength and process-ability to provide a cost effective structural material. The research described in this thesis has been concerned with the development and characterisation of a series of ceramic compounds that can be moulded at modest temperatures(130 - 160 " C) and pressures in a manufacturing system that replicates <b>dough</b> <b>moulding</b> compounds (DMC) as used for polymeric matrix composites. The conventional polyester matrix of polymeric DMC {{has been replaced by a}} soluble inorganic system which is compounded with fibres, fillers and hardening agents to produce a paste-like or doughy substance The handle-ability of the material is determined by the viscosity of the matrix and the type or amount of fillers and additives present. The research has involved a careful set of experiments in which the formulation of the ceramic DMC has been systematically varied in order to achieve an optimum viscosity for storage and handling together with a further series of experiments studying the hardening and cure of the compounds. The mechanical properties of the compounds have been measured and additional formulation changes have been introduced to maintain desirable processing characteristics while improving mechanical properties, and in particular the impact resistance using instrumented falling weight impact machines. Finally the fire properties of the compounds have been studied using cone calorimetry and indicative furnace testing. The structure of the compound has been studied throughout the programme with various microscopic techniques and thermal analysis systems used to characterise the materials, their dispersion and changes that occurred during processing and after high temperature exposure. The final result of the programme has been the identification of a range of material formulations that can provide a tough moulding compound, capable of high temperature service use, that possesses useful structural properties and which can be processed cheaply at modest temperatures using low cost materials...|$|E

50|$|CMC powder {{is widely}} used in the ice cream industry. It is used to make ice creams without {{churning}} mechanism or extreme low temperatures thereby eliminating the need of the conventional churners or salt ice mixes. CMC is used in bakery products like breads and cake preparation. The use of CMC gives loaf a much improved quality at a reduced cost to the baker economizing on the fat component. CMC is also used as an emulsifier in producing high quality biscuits. Due to CMC, fat disperses uniformly in the dough and hence CMC improves {{the release of the}} <b>dough</b> from the <b>moulds</b> and cutters to achieve well-shaped biscuits without any distorted edges. It can help to reduce consumption of egg yolk or fat used in making biscuits, thus achieving economy. Use of CMC in candy preparation ensures smooth dispersion in flavour oils, improves texture & quality. They are used in chewing gums, margarines and peanut butter as emulsifier, also it is used in leather crafting to burnish the edges.|$|R

Besides, the incineration emissions contribute a large impact to our environment. Therefore, {{it is important}} to develop new technology of cartridge water filter that has less impact towards environment, which is the bio-based cartridge water filter. The raw material used in the development of bio-based cartridge water filter is banana stem. The cartridge was prepared by mixing the banana stem powder with glue that made from Sago flour to form dough and followed by pressing the <b>dough</b> into the <b>mould.</b> The molded <b>dough</b> was heated at 80 °C for 5 days with the mould covered and another 10 days without the mould to remove the moisture contamination of the cartridge. The water quality evaluated were turbidity, color, free and total chlorine, suspended solid, pH and dissolve oxygen. The results were compares with the conventional cartridge water filter which is the polypropylene cartridge. It was found that the bio-based cartridge water filter have similar performance with conventional cartridge water filter and even better from it because it can remove 100 percent remove free and total chlorine from the water sample.

40|$|Kenkey, is a maize based sour, stiff dumpling, and it {{is among}} the most common {{fermented}} cereal food products in Ghana. There are several types of kenkey, and while some are made from whole maize grains others are produced using degermed/and dehulled maize grains. The kenkey types made using dehulled maize grains are less popular and have largely remained at the level of “ethnic food”, restricted to very few socio-cultural communities. Current trends in urbanization, and the increasing popularity of kenkey among consumers, require larger scale production with consistent quality. The study was carried out to examine the traditional white kenkey process and to optimize the key processing variables in order to obtain reproducible quality white kenkey that will be acceptable to native and non-native consumers. A survey was conducted in three white kenkey production districts to collate information on production, vending and consumption practices. The sensory profile and consumer acceptance of different types of kenkey and other fermented maize products in Ghana were investigated. A total of two hundred consumers including 110 Ghanaians and 90 internationals were used for the consumer test. Traditional white kenkey types were analyzed for their physicochemical, textural, microstructure and sensory characteristics. Physicochemical analysis involved determination of pH, titratable acidity, sugars, lactic acids, minerals, vitamins and amino acids using high performance liquid chromatography procedures. The textural characteristics of white kenkey randomly obtained from traditional processors were determined using instrumental (texture analyser) and consumer assessments. The effects of processing variables of steeping time (12, 30 and 48 h) and dough fermentation time (0, 12 and 24 h) on the physicochemical properties of white kenkey were determined. A (three variable) Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the processing variables of steeping time, steeping temperature, and fermentation time on white kenkey quality parameters of moisture, pH, titratable acidity, glucose and lactic acid content. The optimum region of the process variables was obtained by hedonic tests on the white kenkey using balanced incomplete block design (for k= 5, b= 21, λ= 2, r = 7) Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) was conducted on white kenkey made from within and outside the optimum region of the process variables, as well as white kenkey obtained from vendors using a panel of 18 trained members. Consumer acceptance study was conducted using 65 consumers for white kenkey obtained from the optimum region and traditionally processed white kenkey obtained from vendors. The results of the survey showed that there were two main types of white kenkey, nonsweetened white kenkey and sweetened white kenkey to which sugar is added during production. All three procedures involved steeping of dehulled maize grains which is then milled into a meal. In the (procedure at Atimpoku), the meal was not fermented any further but precooked, moulded into balls wrapped in leaves and steamed. In the (procedure at Anum), the meal was kneaded into dough and allowed to ferment for 12 hours, the fermented dough (70 %) is precooked and mixed with the remaining <b>dough,</b> <b>moulded</b> into balls and steamed. Three classes of behaviours of consumers were identified. Those who liked all the products 'all likers' (36 %), those who preferred the white kenkey 'white likers' (30 %) and those who preferred Banku 'banku likers' (34 %). Sensory attributes important for the white likers were whitish colour, fruity odour, smooth and nonsticky texture, a less sour product without a pronounced fermented odour, and a bland taste. The white kenkey samples randomly obtained from vendors contained 70 – 77 % moisture, 0. 58 - 0. 88 g/ 100 g ash, 0. 09 - 0. 19 g/ 100 g fat, 2. 45 - 2. 84 g/ 100 g protein, vitamin B 1 of 17 - 47 g/ 100 g, had pH of 4. 07 – 4. 54, titratable acidity 0. 42 - 0. 60 % lactic acid, 2 - 28 mg/g glucose, and 0. 6 - 2 mg/g lactic acid. The amino acids lysine, methionine, Gaba and Ornitine values were less than 0. 2 g/ 100 g. Steeping time of maize was complimentary to fermentation time since both influenced the conversion of glucose by lactic acid bacteria into lactic acid. Generally, the longer steeping and fermentation times gave higher levels of glucose and lactic acid in the white kenkey. However, whilst steeping increased glucose level, dough fermentation reduced it. The intensity of whiteness (L) in white kenkey diminished as steeping time increased. On the other hand, fermentation time improved whiteness of kenkey. High aflata (i. e ratio of precooked to uncooked dough) produced kenkey with softer texture, whilst reducing the aflata ratio increased the hardness and stickiness of white kenkey. Consumers preferred white kenkey made using high aflata ratio and steamed for longer periods. The optimization studies showed that processing variables had significant effects on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of white kenkey. The optimum region for the process variables at which the most acceptable kenkey was obtained were steeping time of 30 - 45 h at 30 - 35 ºC temperature followed by 12 h dough fermentation. Consumer acceptance test indicated no significant difference in acceptance between the traditionally processed white kenkey samples and those obtained from the optimum region. White kenkey samples of higher quality potential has been identified. The process for production of white kenkey has been standardized, saving production time. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the potential use of recycled glass fibre composite materials as a replacement for virgin reinforcing materials in new thermoset composites. Specifically the closed-loop mechanical recycling of composites used heavily in the automotive sector known as <b>dough</b> and sheet <b>moulding</b> composites, DMC and SMC respectively, are investigated. The recycling of glass reinforced thermoset polymer composite materials has been an area of investigation for many years and composites used in the automotive industry are of particular interest due to legislative and social pressures on the industry. The mechanical recycling process and then collection of useful fibrous grades of recycled materials, recyclate, by a novel air separation technique were investigated first. The properties of these recyclate fibres were characterised and compared directly with the properties of virgin glass fibres they were to be used to replace. Single fibre tensile tests were employed to compare the strengths of the fibres and single fibre pull-out tests were used to investigate the strength of the interface between the fibres and a polyester matrix. These tests showed the recyclate fibres to be weaker and have a poorer interface with the polyester matrix than the virgin glass fibres. Understanding the properties of the recyclate materials meant their reformulation into new composites could be carefully considered for the production of new high performance materials. Two grades of the collected recyclate materials were then reformulated in to new DMC and SMC composites, replacing percentages of the virgin glass fibre reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured composites were characterised throughout for direct comparison against one another and an unmodified control material, using both three-point flexural tests and Charpy impact tests. Through the modification of existing manufacturing techniques and the development of novel production equipment it has been possible to successfully manufacture both DMC and SMC composites with the recyclate materials used to replace virgin glass fibres. Virgin glass fibres have successfully been replaced by recyclate materials without disrupting standard production techniques and with minimal reduction of the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. As the loadings of recyclate materials used were greatly increased both the flexural and impact strengths were significantly degraded and it was found that chemical modification of the composite could be used to improve these formulations. It has been shown that the recyclate materials should be considered and treated as a distinct reinforcing ingredient, separately from the remaining virgin glass fibres.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression <b>moulding</b> (using <b>dough</b> and sheet <b>moulding</b> compounds), reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|R
