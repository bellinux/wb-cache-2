500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids obviously, I think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen a movie like this." [...] Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the use of}} MotionScan was {{critically}} acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are [...] "dead from the neck down". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; [...] "people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of}} the body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games," [...] he said. [...] "We would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spent more time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved," [...] said Bao.|$|E
500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. This was something that the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I think that would have been, um, just more fun for the audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a genuine eccentric".|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented that she would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she {{would return to the}} show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E

The stranger recognizes him to be a poet, and speaks of how he has spent his life searching for the meaning of Art ('L'art est la science du poète'), and for the elements or principles of Art.

2500|$|In 1986, Gauntlett {{negotiated}} {{the return of}} fictional British secret agent James Bond to Aston Martin. Cubby Broccoli had chosen to recast the character using actor Timothy Dalton, {{in an attempt to}} re-root the Bond-brand back to a more Sean Connery-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production Vantage for use in the filming of The Living Daylights, and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a KGB colonel in the film, however: [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done it but really could not afford the time." ...|$|E

This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the guys did a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires.
