40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} {{response of}} thin films/lines on thicker substrates under internal loadings resulting from material mismatch is examined. As the well-known Stoney formula {{is limited to}} isotropic, blanket films that undergo only small deformations, proper interpretation of curvature-stress relationships for new film geometries and for new experimental testing techniques requires an extension of this analytical framework. Mismatch stresses in thin films/lines and consequent curvature evolution of the film/line-substrate system are investigated in realistic, complex geometries relevant to industrial trends, such as high line aspect ratio, multi-level structure, and large diameter wafers. A combined analytical and numerical method is presented to evaluate curvature and stress evolution in metal and dielectric lines in an interconnect structure on a Si substrate during fabrication steps and subsequent thermal loading. An <b>engineering</b> <b>map</b> based on a closed-form solution for volume-averaged thermal stresses in lines is developed for material selection and design optimization. Coherent gradient sensing (CGS), an optical, full-field and vibration-insensitive experimental method, is used to study large deformation behavior of thin film-substrate systems by measuring the gradient of out-of-plane displacement of deformed surfaces. Experimental results are {{discussed in terms of}} the limitation of the small deformation theory upon which the Stoney formula is predicated. In particular, this work seeks to incorporate anisotropy and non-linearity arising from geometrical changes such as directional patterning and large deformation in the range of isotropic and linear-elastic material behavior. by Tae-Soon Park.

40|$|Technology {{has changed}} {{the focus of this}} {{collection}} in recent years. Presently, digital access to both maps and GIS data is the primary goal. However, maintenance of the paper map collection is vital, as it supports the graduate and undergraduate curricula in many areas. The paper map collection supports students studying geology, natural resources, geography, Great Plains studies, political sciences, history, community and urban planning, and architecture. The University Libraries are a regional depository for U. S. Government documents, and the majority of maps in the Libraries 2 ̆ 7 collection are distributed through this program. Although, most new maps currently received through this program are digital and access is provided on-line, 400 to 600 per year are still distributed in paper. These, and commercially published maps, such as those by National Geographic, make up the bulk of new paper maps added to the collection. It has been the practice of the University Libraries to distribute the depository maps to the various libraries or library departments based on subject specialization. Thus, U. S. government maps dealing with agriculture, soils, or forestry are located in the C. Y. Thompson Library. Geology and domestic topographic maps distributed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) are located in the Geology Library, and maps distributed by the U. S. Department of Energy are held in the Engineering Library. Love Library holds the rest of the collection.

40|$|In this thesis, guiding and routing {{of optical}} signals in high index {{difference}} ([delta]m) waveguide systems are studied for silicon microphotonic applications. High [delta]n waveguide systems offer compact device sizes that enable highly dense integrated optics suitable for silicon microphotonics. Scattering loss {{due to the}} roughness at the core/cladding interfaces is identified as {{a major source of}} loss in a high M system. Using both experimental and theoretical approaches, the interdependence of scattering loss, waveguide dimension, and roughness is investigated. We developed a 3 dimensional model that successfully explains the scattering loss dependence on the waveguide dimension. Using this model, a loss contour map is constructed to better understand the scattering loss from interface roughness. This map provides an effective methodology to reduce roughness scattering, which we used to develop two fabrication technologies. Loss reduction from 32 dB/cm to 0. 8 dB/cm is achieved for [delta]n = 2. 0. This is the lowest loss ever achieved for a single-mode, high An system. PolySi/Si 02 waveguide systems are investigated due to the compatibility of multi-level processing. Our best PolySi/Si 02 waveguide shows additional 10 dB/cm loss, coming mainly from the top surface roughness due to grain boundary grooving. compared to a Si/Si 02 waveguide. Compact high An routing devices such as round bends, Y-splitters, and Multi-Mode Interference (MMI) splitters are fabricated and tested. We show that single-mode waveguide bends exhibit μm size bending with low loss and single-mode splitters show splitting with good uniformity. MMis show advantages over equivalent Y-splitter based structures in terms of size and loss. Our MMI design led to the fabrication of the smallest optical 1 x 16 fanout ever built. High Transmission Cavity (HTC) based bends, splitters, and resonators, that are compatible with an anisotropic etching technique, are demonstrated. An index <b>engineering</b> <b>map,</b> which shows competing trends of minimum bending radius and scattering loss as tin is changed. is constructed. From this map, the optimal M can be found for a given fabrication technology. Improvement in the fabrication technology allows for higher tin and provides a scaling law in optical devices. This point is proven by our 0. 8 dB/cm Si/Si 02 waveguides, which lifts the upper limit of the usable [delta]n. by Kevin Kidoo Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Catalytic {{oxidation}} {{of hydrogen}} and methane is studied, {{with emphasis on}} the influence of catalytic and homogeneous chemistries on bifurcation behavior and their impact on reactor operation. In order to simplify this complex problem, only the homogeneous problem was first studied through detailed modeling. Subsequently, the full catalytic problem was addressed with experiments and simulations, using a platinum catalyst. Simulation results were analyzed using a variety of numerical techniques to understand the role and interplay of chemistry, reaction exothermicity, and transport on bifurcation behavior. Experimental data was used primarily for model validation and refinement. ^ Investigation of only homogeneous oxidation (by modeling a perfectly mixed reactor) revealed that at relatively low pressures, gas-phase H 2 ignition is kinetically driven, while at higher pressures, reaction exothermicity is essential for multiplicity and is significantly influenced by the transport of HO 2 and H 2 O 2. In contrast, gas-phase CH 4 ignition shows a strong dependence on thermal feedback, regardless of reactor parameters, even when purely kinetic ignition is possible. Although oxidation of CH 4 is chemically more complex than H 2, the dependence of CH 4 ignition on pressure and species transport is less complex than that of H 2. Mechanism reduction (for hydrogen and methane) and ignition criterion development (for hydrogen) were also performed to explore the possibilities of reducing the complexity of the problem. ^ Catalytic combustion of H 2 over platinum was subsequently modeled using a stagnation-point flow geometry. The study showed that at low temperatures, a distinct set of catalytic ignitions, extinctions, and autotherms occurs, attributed to surface reactions alone. The onset of homogeneous chemistry was seen at temperatures greater than ∼ 1000 K. Using turning points as the limits of stability, an <b>engineering</b> <b>map</b> indicating parameters for catalytic and complete oxidation was generated. In addition to the modeling efforts, catalytic ignition and autothermal temperatures were also measured experimentally. These results validate the model predictions reasonably well, showing that the model is capable of capturing the intriguing features of catalytic oxidation, such as autotherms, ignition, multiplicity, and the surface stoichiometric point. ^ Finally, reaction mechanism synthesis was studied. Using a semi-empirical approach, a general methodology for predicting the kinetic parameters for catalytic reactions was developed, which is thermodynamically consistent and takes into account adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The H 2 oxidation over platinum has been chosen as a model system to test this methodology. Comparison with a variety of available experimental data in the literature shows that the proposed surface mechanism is capable of quantitatively capturing all the important features of the published experiments. ...|$|E
