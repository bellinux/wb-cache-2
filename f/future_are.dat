5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature {{of the past and}} world literature of the <b>future</b> <b>are</b> thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its <b>future</b> <b>are</b> pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluation}} strategy of <b>futures,</b> which may <b>be</b> termed call by <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> non-deterministic: {{the value of}} a <b>future</b> will <b>be</b> evaluated at some time between when the <b>future</b> <b>is</b> created and when its value is used, but the precise time is not determined beforehand and can change from run to run. The computation can start as soon as the <b>future</b> <b>is</b> created (eager evaluation) or only when the value is actually needed (lazy evaluation), and may be suspended part-way through, or executed in one run. Once {{the value of a}} <b>future</b> <b>is</b> assigned, it is not recomputed on <b>future</b> accesses; this <b>is</b> like the memoization used in call by need.|$|R

5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and <b>future</b> <b>are</b> related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe <b>future</b> <b>are</b> well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Futures</b> {{can easily}} <b>be</b> {{implemented}} in channels: a <b>future</b> <b>is</b> a one-element channel, {{and a promise}} {{is a process that}} sends to the channel, fulfilling the future.

25|$|Logical determinism: The {{notion that}} all propositions, whether about the past, present or <b>future,</b> <b>are</b> either true or false.

25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers.

25|$|Memories of 'future relevance' {{are also}} {{consolidated}} greater during sleep. In {{a study by}} Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories of items that participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep. Sleep consolidated these memories of future relevance to a greater extent. Memories that are emotionally significant and relevant for the <b>future</b> <b>are</b> therefore preferentially consolidated during sleep. This can translate to mean that memories that are more meaningful or valuable to a person are consolidated more.|$|E
50|$|Some languages, such as Alice ML, define <b>futures</b> that <b>are</b> {{associated}} with a specific thread that computes the future's value.

After the accident 49 recovered bolts were investigated, of which 41 had fatigue cracks. On 8bolts, the fatigue damaged area exceeded 90% of the total cross-sectional area.|$|E

40|$|<b>Futures</b> <b>are</b> {{special kind}} of values that allow the {{synchronisation}} of different processes. <b>Futures</b> <b>are</b> in fact identifiers for promised results of function calls that are still awaited. When the result {{is necessary for the}} computation, the process is blocked until the result is returned. We are interested in this paper in transparent first-class futures, and their use within distributed components. We say that <b>futures</b> <b>are</b> transparent if the result is automatically and implicitly awaited upon the first access to the value; and that <b>futures</b> <b>are</b> first-class if they can be transmitted between components as usual objects. Thus, because of the difficulty to identify future objects, analysing the behaviour of components using first-class transparent <b>futures</b> <b>is</b> challenging. This paper contributes with first a static representation for futures, second a means to detect local deadlocks in a component system with first class futures, and finally extensions to interface definitions in order to avoid such deadlocks...|$|R

25|$|Current UN {{projections}} show {{a continued}} increase in {{population in the}} near future (but a steady decline in the population growth rate), with the global population expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. Estimates by the UN Population Division for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion; mathematical modeling supports the lower estimate.
