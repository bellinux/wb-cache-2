5|$|On 12 August 1921, the League {{was asked}} to settle the matter; the Council created a {{commission}} with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide {{the details of the}} interaction between the two areas – for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> the two areas. In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{complexity}} of round robin iterative data flow analysis has been traditionally defined as 1 + d where d is {{the depth of}} a control flow graph. However, this bound is restricted to bit vector frameworks, which by definition, are separable. For non-separable frameworks, the {{complexity of}} analysis {{is influenced by the}} <b>interdependences</b> <b>of</b> program entities, hence the bound of 1 + d is not applicable. This motivates the need for capturing the <b>interdependences</b> <b>of</b> entities to define a general complexity measure. We propose Degree of dependence δ which quantifies the effect of non-separability on the complexity of analysis for a particular problem instance. We define the complexity bound of 1 + δ + d which explains the complexity of round robin analysis of general nonseparable data flow problems. Like d, δ is a theoretical concept useful for understanding the complexity rather than estimating it. In bit vector frameworks the bound 1 + δ + d reduces to 1 + d due to δ = 0. Apart from being general, our bound is also precise, as corroborated by empirical results. Index Terms — Data flow analysis, Complexity, Constant propagatio...|$|R
25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free movement of goods, capital, services, technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies and capital. Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology.|$|E

25|$|Globalization (or globalisation; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the increasing}} interaction of people through {{the growth of the}} international flow of money, ideas and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of integration which has social and cultural aspects as well. It involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology and data. Advances in the means of transport (such as the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships) and in telecommunications infrastructure (including the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones) have been major factors in globalization, generating further <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> economic and cultural activities.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{positive}} relationship between trust and supply chain performance and to investigate whether the <b>interdependence</b> structure <b>of</b> the supply chain network moderates such an effect. Interdependencies occur in supply chain because supply chain partners depend upon one another for product and process accomplishments and for the needed resources and capabilities owned by their partners. The interdependence structure is described in terms <b>of</b> <b>interdependence</b> pattern (which partner depends on each one) and degree <b>of</b> <b>interdependence</b> (density <b>of</b> interdependencies). Both variables are supposed to moderate the relationship between trust and enhanced supply chain performance. The proposed conceptual model is operazionalized through NK model and finally tested using simulation. Results confirm that the positive effect of trust on supply chain performance varies across the different examined interdependence structures. We also find that trust is detrimental for supply chain performance under a particular type of pattern characterized by a dependent form of interactions...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, General Butler was {{preparing}} his soldiers {{for an attack}} on the forts that were now in Farragut's rear. Commodore Porter, now in charge of the flotilla still below the forts, delivered a demand to surrender to the forts, but General Duncan refused. Accordingly, Porter again began to bombard the forts, this time in preparation for Butler's assault. However, on the night of April 29, the enlisted garrison in Fort Jackson mutinied and refused to endure more. Although Fort St. Philip was not involved in the mutiny, the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> the two forts meant that it was also affected. Unable to continue the battle, Duncan capitulated the next day.|$|E

The Royal Government of Cambodia estimates Cambodia contains approximately 10.36 million hectares of forest cover, representing approximately 57.07% of Cambodia’s land area (2011). On the contrary, international observers and independent sources provide rather different numbers. Consensus permeates, as most sources agree, that deforestation, loss of seasonal wetlands and habitat destruction - among countless minor factors - correlates with the absence of strict administrative control and indifference in law enforcement - not only in Cambodia but the entire region.|$|E

25|$|A related issue, said Pius, is the {{relation}} between capital and labour and the determination of fair wages. Pius develops the following ethical mandate: The Church considers it a perversion of industrial society to have developed sharp opposite camps based on income. He welcomes all attempts to alleviate these differences. Three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family, the economic condition of the enterprise, and {{the economy as a}} whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and a sound enterprise. Thus, Pius concludes that cooperation and not conflict is a necessary condition, given the mutual <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> the parties involved.|$|E

If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E
