5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, {{to the effect}} that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E

Both sides <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with resource supply and personnel issues {{over the course of the}} siege. British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access.

The absence of conflict, along with its inevitable counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Liberal Party, Loxton entered {{politics}} and was a {{member of the}} Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979. During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970–71. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of the subcontinent in 1959–60, overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident.|$|E

Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by the Arab League, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{successful}} Bulgarian actions the Byzantines were no longer capable of taking the city with a direct assault. They also could not exhaust the defenders with hunger because, after their supplies were cut, the Byzantines themselves <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with that problem. In addition, an army led by Samuil marched into the mountains at the Byzantines' rear. In the meantime, instead of securing the way for retreat, Leon Melissenos pulled back to Plovdiv. That action was an additional reason for Basil II to lift the siege. The commander of the Western armies, Kontostephanos, persuaded him that Melissenos had set off to Constantinople to take his throne.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with the}} major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited {{as a reason for}} the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E

5|$|Dowling took {{command of}} the RAN's first {{aircraft}} carrier, , in 1948. He became Chief of Naval Personnel in 1950, and Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet in 1953. Soon after taking up the position of CNS in February 1955, {{he was promoted to}} vice admiral and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. As CNS he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with shortages of money, manpower and equipment, and with the increasing role of the United States in Australia's defence planning, at the expense of traditional ties with Britain. Knighted in 1957, Dowling was Chairman of COSC from March 1959 until May 1961, when he retired from the military. In 1963 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order and became Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, serving until his death in 1969.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with issues {{regarding}} land and labour. The latter was of major significance {{at this time in}} Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced labour was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply labour. Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning labour by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's view was that a mutually beneficial relationship between capital and labour was possible through market forces alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of compulsory labour even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
