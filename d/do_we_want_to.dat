He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Using two {{digital video}} (DV) cameras, Bartley and ÓBriain shot over 200 hours of {{material}} on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described {{the amount of}} footage compared to the film's final length as [...] "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro and Bickford hired screenwriter Benjamin A. van der Veen {{to write}} the screenplay's first drafts, and their {{extensive}} research took them to Cuba where they met with several of the remaining members of Guevara's team in Bolivia {{as well as the}} revolutionary's wife and children. [...] It was during this phase of development that the filmmakers discovered Terrence Malick had been in Bolivia as a journalist in 1966 working on a story about Che. [...] Malick came on as director and worked on the screenplay with van der Veen and Del Toro, but after a year-and-a-half, the financing had not come together entirely and Malick left to make The New World, a film about Jamestown, Virginia. Afraid that their multi-territory deals would fall apart, Bickford and Del Toro asked Steven Soderbergh, who was previously on board as producer, to direct. The filmmaker was drawn to the contrast of [...] "engagement versus disengagement. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> participate or observe? Once Che made the decision to engage, he engaged fully. Often people attribute that to a higher power, but as an atheist, he didn't have that. I found that very interesting". Furthermore, he remarked that Guevara was [...] "great movie material" [...] and [...] "had one of the most fascinating lives" [...] that he could [...] "imagine in the last century". Bickford and Del Toro realized that there was no context for what made Guevara decide to go to Bolivia. They began looking for someone to rewrite the screenplay; [...] Peter Buchman was recommended to them because he had a good reputation for writing about historical figures, based on a script he worked about Alexander the Great. He spent a year reading every available book on Guevara in preparation for writing the script. The project was put on hold when Bickford and Del Toro made Traffic with Soderbergh.|$|E

2500|$|On October 22, 2003, Moody {{left the}} band during the European tour for Fallen, {{reportedly}} because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: [...] "...we'd gotten {{to a point}} that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." [...] This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the thing that people would want to hear..." [...] She adds [...] "So that's a lot of the reason [...] it's been so fun writing now, is [...] we're not thinking about that. It's like 'what do we like?', 'what's fun?', like 'what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that's different?'" [...] Moody was replaced by Terry Balsamo from Cold.|$|E

Vocals were done in The Garage Studios in Stockholm, while additional vocals were recorded in Vocal Land Studio. Drum parts were recorded at Atlantisstudion in Stockholm. By the mid-December 2009, the band had finished with the recording of the album. Just before Christmas, they invited people from the European record company people to a listening session. After they listened to the whole album {{the next day the}} management told the band that the record company loved it and that it was the best record in years. The management proposed the idea of this album being the last studio album and announcing a final tour. Matthias Jabs explained [...] "We had never spent a second thinking about this.

We were taken back a bit, but after a couple days living with the thought we decided together – that would be the right thing to <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go out on top while we are still healthy and can still do a high-energy show that’s two, sometimes three hours a night." ...|$|E

People will always think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it good enough, dear? Just to specialise.... I think of you.

6000|$|The great {{mechanical}} impulses of the age, {{of which}} {{most of us are}} so proud, are a mere passing fever, half-speculative, half-childish. People will discover at last that royal roads to anything can no more be laid in iron than they can in dust; that there are, in fact, no royal roads to anywhere worth going to; that if there were, it would that instant cease to be worth going to,--I mean so far as the things to be obtained are in any way estimable in terms of price. For there are two classes of precious things in the world: those that God gives us for nothing--sun, air, and life (both mortal life and immortal); and the secondarily precious things which he gives us for a price: these secondarily precious things, worldly wine and milk, can only be bought for definite money; they never can be cheapened. No cheating nor bargaining will ever get a single thing out of nature's [...] "establishment" [...] at half-price. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be strong?--we must work. To be hungry?--we must starve. To be happy?--we must be kind. To be wise?--we must look and think. No changing of place at a hundred miles an hour, nor making of stuffs a thousand yards a minute, will make us one whit stronger, happier, or wiser. There was always more in the world than men could see, walked they ever so slowly; they will see it no better for going fast. And they will at last, and soon too, find out that their grand inventions for conquering (as they think) space and time, do, in reality, conquer nothing; for space and time are, in their own essence, unconquerable, and besides did not want any sort of conquering; they wanted using. A fool always wants to shorten space and time: a wise man wants to lengthen both. A fool wants to kill space and kill time: a wise man, first to gain them, then to animate them. Your railroad, when you come to understand it, is only a device for making the world smaller: and as for being able to talk from place to place, that is, indeed, well and convenient; but suppose you have, originally, nothing to say.[95] We shall be obliged at last to confess, what we should long ago have known, that the really precious things are thought and sight, not pace. It does a bullet no good to go fast; and a man, if he be truly a man, no harm to go slow; for his glory is not at all in going, but in being.|$|E
