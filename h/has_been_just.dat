25|$|Global {{market share}} for {{processing}} has remained stable, even as grindings increase to meet demand. One {{of the largest}} processing country by volume is the Netherlands, handling around 13% of global grindings. Europe and Russia as a whole handle about 38% of the processing market. Average year after year demand growth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> over 3% since 2008. While Europe and North America are relatively stable markets, increasing household income in developing countries {{is the main reason}} of the stable demand growth. As demand is awaited to keep growing, supply growth may slow down due to changing weather conditions in the largest cocoa production areas.|$|E

The University of Regina Cougars and the University of Saskatchewan Huskies are men's and women's teams which compete in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The Saskatchewan Huskies men's team made history and won their first ever CIS Championship in the 2009-2010 season under head coach Barry Rawlyk. Three {{members of the}} squad were named CIS Championship Tournament All-Stars, {{one of which was}} also named tournament MVP. The Regina Cougars success <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as brief. The Cougars' women's team won the CIS championship in the 2000–01 season. The CIS women's basketball tournament was held in Saskatchewan in March 2008, with the University of Saskatchewan hosting the tournament.|$|E

But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
500|$|Hoshino {{has been}} highly praised for her art, {{which has been}} {{compared}} to the works of Joe Madureira, Kelley Jones, and Chris Bachalo by one reviewer and described as [...] "some of the best artwork in the business" [...] by another. Her character designs received many positive comments ranging from [...] "especially lovely" [...] to [...] "the most visually striking element" [...] of her art and it is said that both male and female readers will enjoy the designs. However, she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as highly criticized for her lack of skill in drawing action scenes, which leads one reviewer to believe she will not or cannot draw physical combat.|$|E

It will claim that that Austrian action <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as much of a surprise to it as to the other Powers, pointing out the fact that the Emperor is on his northern journey, and that the Prussian Minister of War, as well as the Chief of the Grand General Staff are away on leave of absence." ...|$|E

2500|$|The aye-aye's {{classification}} {{with the}} order Primates <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as uncertain. [...] It {{has been considered}} a highly derived {{member of the family}} Indridae, a basal branch of the strepsirrhine suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates. [...] In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade {{with the rest of the}} Malagasy lemurs, despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuriformes, deriving from the same lemur ancestor that rafted to Madagascar during the Paleocene or Eocene. [...] In 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular mimicry {{is defined}} as the {{theoretical}} possibility that sequence similarities between foreign and self-peptides are sufficient to result in the cross-activation of autoreactive T or B cells by pathogen-derived peptides. Despite the promiscuity of several peptide sequences which can be both foreign and self in nature, a single antibody or TCR (T cell receptor) can be activated by even a few crucial residues which stresses the importance of structural homology in the theory of molecular mimicry. Upon the activation of B or T cells, it is believed that these [...] "peptide mimic" [...] specific T or B cells can cross-react with self-epitopes, thus leading to tissue pathology (autoimmunity). Molecular mimicry is a phenomenon that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> recently discovered as one of several ways in which autoimmunity can be evoked. A molecular mimicking event is, however, more than an epiphenomenon despite its low statistical probability of occurring and these events have serious implications in the onset of many human autoimmune disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Conwell first {{appeared}} in the role of Leslie Michaelson on December 2, 2010, introduced by the soap opera's former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell on a recurring status. Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. When I went to the audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched a lot of movies where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I think is very important. I had been a fan of the show, so I had an idea of the role. But thank goodness for the internet." [...] Conwell said that she enjoys playing Leslie, a role which signifies [...] "growth" [...] for her career. In December 2012, after two years on recurring, Conwell was placed on contract by Bell's successor, Jill Farren Phelps however, was dropped back to recurring in August 2014.|$|E
