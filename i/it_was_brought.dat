5|$|Broadly speaking, {{daylight}} saving time was abandoned {{in the years after}} the war (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades and commonly during World War II.

5|$|Many envisioned {{starting}} a silk {{industry in the}} British colonies in America, starting in 1619, under the reign of King James I of England. The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> by Cortez in 1522. Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.|$|E

The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} it was a good deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, {{to the extent}} that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E

In 2001 Kalokola, ostensibly on behalf of the Lihau family, filed a complaint against unknown persons with the attorney general of Kinshasa, claiming that Lihau had been murdered. He based his assertion on a strange visit that Lihau supposedly had with someone the day {{after the death of his}} wife and on unusual signs that were observed on Lihau's body when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to Kinshasa.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by VelÃ¡zquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E
5|$|The {{style that}} {{developed}} from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, {{is now known as}} Gothic. It was characterised by pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to Britain by the Cistercians, whose abbeys retained thick walls, but pierced them with lancet arches with slender pointed arches. This style became characteristic of the early Gothic in Britain and can be seen at Dundrennan Abbey, begun around 1142, which resembles religious foundations in northern England. The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was {{under the control of}} the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> {{under the control of the}} Afghan General Kalapahad. Following the defeat of the Afghan king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was under the control of the Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E
