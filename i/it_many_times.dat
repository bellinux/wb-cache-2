He was also forming a friendship with a third composer who influenced him, Frédéric Chopin; under his influence Liszt's poetic and romantic side began to develop.|$|E

25|$|Places are {{determined}} to be haunted if people {{in contact with the}} areas encounter severe misfortunes. In this case, a yuta, or several yuta, are usually contracted to contact the offended spirit and determine both how the offending individual can recompensate for his trespass, and whether or not the spirit can be brought to terms with the aims of the individual for the spirit's area. Though the spirit can almost always be pacified, <b>it</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> cannot accept the disturbance of its space, and thus the area is marked by the community as forbidden territory for development or travel. A yuta, a Buddhist monk, or a Shinto priest may be called upon to banish the spirit.|$|E
25|$|Rusk's {{mountaineering}} career {{took him}} all over the West Coast of the United States, beginning in 1889 and continuing to 1930. He met many other people on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described {{him as one of}} the most expert and daring mountaineers in the West. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, he had very few accidents while climbing and often saved others from extreme danger. He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing <b>it</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E
25|$|M. drewseni {{typically}} feed on nectar, pulp (paper), {{and other}} insects. Most foraging for food occurs {{close to the}} nest (within 40–50 m). When this species preys on other insects, it typically snatches the prey, chews it into a pulp and then returns to the nest. Foragers also have been seen attacking insects that are stuck on spiders’ webs. ll captured prey tends to be fairly substantial in size (greater than 3mm) but small enough that the wasp could chew the whole insect {{before returning to the}} nest. Because foragers chew their prey so quickly, it can be very hard to determine exactly what their prey is. In fact, M. flavitarsis is the only Mischocyttarus species with published prey information. They reportedly prey on flies and caterpillars and, occasionally, meat and fish. Aside from various prey, nectar {{plays a key role in}} M. drewseni diets. This nectar is typically consumed from the buds and flowers of Althernanthera ficoidae, Hyptis atrorubens, and Clidemia hirta. Once a wasp finds a good source of nectar, it tends to return to <b>it</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> just like workers return to the same nest material supply. This seems to be an individual venture, as there is no communication between foragers when a good nectar supply is located.|$|E
