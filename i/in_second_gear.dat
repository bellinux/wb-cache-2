5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. The session was held in cooler night-time weather conditions. Drivers used soft-compound tyres for their first timed laps before entering the pit lane for new tyres {{for the remainder of}} the session. Vandoorne set the pace in the early part of the session and improved to clinch his first pole position of the season, and his fifth consecutive in the series, with a time of 1:39.237. He was joined on the grid's front row by his teammate Matsushita who was three-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Lynn was ninth after his first timed lap but recovered to qualify in third place. Pic, who was Vandoorne's closest contender in the session's opening segment, took fourth, ahead of Marciello who was stuck <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear</b> until his team corrected the issue. King was relegated to sixth by Marciello's fastest lap. Norman Nato and Rossi were seventh and eighth. Gasly made a mistake late in the session which restricted him to ninth and Sirotkin rounded out the top ten. Artem Markelov was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top-ten starting positions; his best lap time was seven-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Haryanto ran strongly in the session's early period but took 12th after he was unable to improve on his second set of soft-compound tyres. He was ahead of Evans, Robert Visoiu, and Richie Stanaway. The two Carlin drivers qualified in 16th and 18th (with Julián Leal ahead of Marco Sørensen). They were separated by Sergio Canamasas in the faster of the two MP Motorsport cars. André Negrão, Daniël de Jong, Nathanaël Berthon, René Binder, Marlon Stöckinger, and Zoël Amberg were the last of the qualifiers.|$|E
5|$|Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as {{they pushed}} hard {{in their efforts}} to build up a {{sufficient}} lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try to stay ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap28. Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear.</b> With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.|$|E
25|$|The track {{underwent}} a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the ultra-fast track (where {{in its last}} years every corner was taken in no lower than fourth or fifth gear, depending on the transmission of the car, except for the Bridge chicane, which was usually taken <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear)</b> into a more technical track. The reshaped track's first F1 race {{was perhaps the most}} memorable of recent years, with Nigel Mansell coming home first in front of his home crowd. On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell even found time to pick up stranded rival Ayrton Senna and give him a lift on his side-pod after Senna's McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race.|$|E
50|$|Noise 2: This noise, {{commonly}} referred to as gear rattle, can be induced by lugging the engine in any gear, but is usually most noticeable <b>in</b> first or <b>second</b> <b>gear.</b> While the noise is occurring, if you press lightly on the clutch pedal without releasing the clutch, the noise will be reduced or eliminated.|$|R

50|$|Winter (W): In some Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and General Motors models, {{a winter}} mode can be engaged so that <b>second</b> <b>gear</b> is {{selected}} instead of first when {{pulling away from}} stationary, to {{reduce the likelihood of}} loss of traction due to wheel spin on snow or ice. On GM cars, this was D2 <b>in</b> the 1950s, <b>Second</b> <b>Gear</b> Start after 1990, and Snow/Ice mode in the 2010s. On Ford, Kia, and Honda automatics, this feature can be accessed by moving the gear selector to 2 to start, then taking one's foot off the accelerator while selecting D once the vehicle is moving.|$|R
25|$|After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was {{completed}} {{in time for the}} 2011 race, the start of the track was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear</b> and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a minimum speed of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start-finish straight.|$|E

2500|$|Elliott closely battled Kulwicki, {{trying to}} take the lead, but Kulwicki held off the challenge. Elliott backed off, and at lap 300, Kulwicki held about a two-second lead. Kulwicki's team planned to make their last pit stop on lap 306, again {{intending}} to take on fuel only. With Elliott narrowing the margin, however, Kulwicki's crew moved the pit stop up to lap 309 as he was nearing the point where he could clinch an additional five championship bonus points for having led the most laps during the race. Kulwicki finally stopped on lap 310, boosting his laps led total to 103. By opting for a [...] "gas and go" [...] stop, [...] Kulwicki was able to save time and have his crew ready to push the car in case it stalled, since he was forced to start the car <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear.</b> There was some concern that Kulwicki did not take on enough fuel, but the crew was not going to call him in again.|$|E
2500|$|Barris built two {{fiberglass}} {{copies of}} the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet [...] "fuzz" [...] paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. [...] Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The three replicas are all based on a 1965–1966 Ford Galaxie. The #1 Barris-built Batmobile sold at Barrett-Jackson Auctions on January 19, 2013 for $4,620,000,. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections, including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry. This car was built with a dual-quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine, Art Carr-prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5.14 gears in the rear end. Quarter-mile times were in the mid-12 second range, primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>gear</b> and smoke the overinflated rear tires for show down most of the strip. The [...] "rocket exhaust" [...] was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically.|$|E

50|$|The lap {{starts with}} a short sprint up Boulevard Albert Ier, to the tight Sainte-Dévote corner. This is a nearly 90-degree {{right-hand}} bend usually taken <b>in</b> first or <b>second</b> <b>gear.</b> This corner has seen many first lap accidents, although these are less common since {{the removal of the}} mini roundabout on the apex of the corner before the 2003 event, making the entrance to the corner wider. The cars then head uphill along Avenue d'Ostende, before changing down for the long left-hander at Massenet. The maximum gradient {{in this part of the}} circuit is around 12%.|$|R

Interior features further included Walnut wood trim and an optional in-dash six-CD changer. The overall RX 300 concept, which directed SUV qualities to an on-road vehicle, was based on market research which found that merely 7 percent of SUV owners drove off-road. The RX 300 interior featured leather trim, two rows of seating, and a rear cargo area which could be concealed beneath a tonneau cover. The center dashboard was dominated by a central liquid crystal display (LCD) multi-information screen for audio, climate, and performance data, along with a U-shaped wood trim piece {{and a pair of}} air conditioning vents. The gear shift was mounted {{at the base of the}} center console, thus leaving open space below for additional storage space, legroom, or movement to the passenger-side seat.

50|$|Based in Hamilton, New Zealand, Torpedo7 {{was founded}} in 2004 by {{mountain}} bike enthusiast Luke Howard-Willis. A 51% stake was purchased by The Warehouse Group for NZ$33 million in 2013. While The Warehouse Group now has full ownership (through Torpedo7's ultimate parent company, Boye Developments Limited), Torpedo7 continues to operate as a standalone business. In October 2014, seven R&R Sport stores previously acquired by The Warehouse Group in December 2013 rebranded as Torpedo7.

It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side twist grip. It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in neutral (the start gear) and used the pedals as a kick starter. To pedal the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the clutch lever was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put <b>in</b> first or <b>second</b> <b>gear.</b> The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960.
