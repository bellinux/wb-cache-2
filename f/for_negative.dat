5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the profusion of passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, {{one and a}} half were <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, two and a half of which were for losses. One and a half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and {{recovered}} two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's kicking {{game had}} {{a far more}} active day than its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso booted sevenpunts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed threefieldgoals. The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, an average of 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough {{in the air to}} allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> yardage.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's third {{drive of}} the quarter started from its 23-yard line. The first two plays of the drive were stopped <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> gain, then Taylor {{completed}} a 17-yard throw to Jarret Boykin for a first down. Tech couldn't gain another first down, however, and punted to Stanford, which started from its 13-yard line. As in Virginia Tech's previous drive, the Stanford offense began with a play that lost yardage, but it made up the failure with a running play that gained sixyards and a passing play from Luck to Fleener for a first down at the Stanford 32-yard line. On the quarter's final play, running back Tyler Gaffney gained sevenyards. With one quarter remaining, Stanford led 26–12.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} an early {{reputation as a}} prolific schoolboy batsman, Jardine played cricket for Winchester College, attended the University of Oxford, playing for its cricket team, and played for Surrey County Cricket Club as an amateur. He developed a defensive method of batting which was unusual for an amateur, receiving occasional criticism <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> batting. Despite this, Jardine was selected in Test matches {{for the first time}} in 1928, and went on to play with some success in the Test series in Australia in 1928–29. Following this tour, his business commitments prevented him from playing as much cricket. However, in 1931, he was asked to captain England in a Test against New Zealand. Although there were some initial misgivings about his captaincy, Jardine led England in the next three cricket seasons and on two overseas tours, one of which was the Australian tour of 1932–33. Of his 15 Tests as captain, he won nine, lost one and drew five. He retired from all first-class cricket in 1934 following a tour to India.|$|E

5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{one and two}} player modes, both {{of which}} are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Jr.; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challenging: Donkey Kong can ask <b>for</b> <b>negative</b> numbers, and the absolute values of the target numbers are in the hundreds instead of the tens.|$|E
50|$|McCroskey did {{two studies}} putting {{different}} variables into each study {{to see the}} effect on the three different types of orientations, ambivalent, indifferent, and upward mobile (Papa 2008). The outcome variables in study 1 were job satisfaction, communication, apprehension, nonverbal immediacy, assertiveness, and responsiveness. For ambivalents the result showed that they had a <b>negative</b> strong relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, positive weak relationship <b>for</b> communication apprehension, <b>negative</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> nonverbal immediacy, no relationship <b>for</b> assertiveness, and <b>negative</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> responsiveness. For the indifferents it showed that they had a <b>negative</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, no relationship for communication apprehension, no relationship for nonverbal immediacy, a <b>negative</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> assertiveness and no relationship for responsiveness. For the upward mobile it showed that there was a positive weak relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, <b>negative</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> communication apprehension, positive moderate relationship for nonverbal immediacy, positive moderate relationship for assertiveness, and a positive moderate relationship for responsiveness(Pruden).For study 2 the outcome variables were job satisfaction, competence, caring, trustworthiness, extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism. For the ambivalent it showed a <b>negative</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, <b>negative</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> competence, <b>negative</b> strong relationship <b>for</b> caring, <b>negative</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> trustworthiness, <b>negative</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> extraversion, positive weak relationship for neuroticism, and positive moderate relationship for psychoticism.
