5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the <b>die</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|E

In the drawn part wall, which is {{in contact with the}} punch, the hoop strain is zero whereby the plane strain condition is reached. In reality, mostly the strain condition is only approximately plane. Due to tensile forces acting in the part wall, wall thinning is prominent and results in an uneven part wall thickness, such that the part wall thickness is lowest {{at the point where the}} part wall loses contact with the punch, i.e., at the punch radius.|$|E

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw <b>die</b> <b>radius.</b> Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production costs. This thesis investigates the influence of draw die geometry on the wear distribution over the draw <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> for AHSS and develops a methodology for optimising the draw die geometry to reduce wear using numerical and experimental methods. Tool wear predictions on automotive sheet metal forming die and recommended protections of the tool surface under the initial production conditions were obtained from AutoForm simulation software. Effects of lubrication coefficients, binder pressure loads and die coating on tool wear distributions were investigated as well. It is concluded that the areas that are most sensitive to tool wear occurs at the locations corresponding to the large gradient of drawing depth. To study the tool wear distributions for more common stamping parts, a numerical tool wear model was developed and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel tests are carried out using an Erichsen sheet metal tester with high pressure prescale films to verify the numerical model results. Comparing the results obtained from the prescale film with {{the results from the}} simulation, it is concluded that the contact pressure distributions indicated by the prescale film are consistent with those from the simulation. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, were numerically investigated using the tool wear model developed, and the contact pressure distribution and tool wear work along the radii were determined. The following conclusions were reached from the investigations: (1) The colour contour of the high contact pressure on the <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> can be divided into three distinct zones of high pressure and tool wear; (2) The dominant zone leading to maximum contact pressure and tool wear severity depends on the geometry of <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> profile under the same material and process conditions; (3) The geometry of draw <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> has a significant influence on the tool wear and standard circular and elliptical curves can lead to the achievement of reduced and uniform contact pressure distribution (wear distribution) along most of zones of the draw <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> arc. The results suggest that to minimise contact pressure and tool wear using this approach it would be necessary to optimise the shape for a particular combination of material type, thickness and forming process. Effects of control parameters, such as blank geometry, punch geometry, deep-drawing process parameters and tool material, on wear behaviour in deep-drawing for various shape of <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> were then investigated to provide guidelines for impacts of these parameters. A specialised software routine was then compiled for optimisation of <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> profiles to minimise and achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python programming language.

Among the various intelligent methods for controlling springback, an artificial neural network (ANN) may be used for real time control by virtue of their robustness and speed. The present work describes the development of an ANN based on backpropagation (BP) of error.

Cup drawability was also studied with the change of material strain hardening exponent, n, strength coefficient, K, average anisotropy, R, and friction coefficients between die-sheet-punch to find the best operating conditions.

One of the key requirements for prepainted coatings is to retain its surface quality and properties during forming process. During forming process, major surface damage occurs when the coated sheet is bent and un-bent around the die corner. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and detail study of the surface conditions is required. In the present study, influence of forming parameters such as <b>die</b> <b>radius,</b> lubrication and specimen material are investigated. The influence of these parameters on friction, surface damage and properties of polymer coatings are evaluated. Experiment set-up is built to conduct bending under tension test. This test gives {{a better way to}} evaluate coating performance, as it closely simulates the die region of real forming process and considers bending effects. Experimental results show increase in friction and surface damage with decrease in <b>die</b> <b>radius.</b> Moreover, with decrease in <b>die</b> <b>radius</b> hardness of the coating decreases and strain in the specimen increases.

The inverse models were created using classifiers that related the weighting vectors to the process parameter levels for the blank holder force (BHF), <b>die</b> <b>radii</b> (DR) and tool gap (TG) of the parameters. Several classifiers were tested: linear, quadratic Gaussian and artificial neural networks. The quadratic Gaussian classifiers were the most accurate and the most consistent type of classifier over all the parameters. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AA 7075 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} structural materials extensively used in automobile and aerospace industries. Extensive research on its formability aspects is required to develop useful components of complex shapes out of this material. One of the ways to measure the formability is to find its deep drawability characteristics. In this study, the significance of three important deep drawing process parameters namely blank temperature, <b>die</b> arc <b>radius</b> and punch velocity on the deep drawing characteristics of aluminium 7075 sheet was determined. The combination of finite element method and Taguchi analysis was used to determine the influence of process parameters. Simulations were carried out as per orthogonal array using DEFORM 2 D software. Based on the predicted deformation of deep drawn cup and analysis of variance test (Anova), it was observed that blank temperature has greatest influence on the formability of aluminium material followed by punch velocity and <b>die</b> arc <b>radius.</b> Multiple regression analysis techniques were applied in modelling the behaviour of AA 7075 aluminium alloy under multistep deformation conditions...|$|R
