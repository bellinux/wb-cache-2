5|$|According to some genealogists, Lady Macbeth and King Duncan's {{wife were}} {{siblings}} or cousins, where Duncan's wife had a stronger {{claim to the}} throne than Lady Macbeth. It was this that incited her <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> hatred of Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Champfleury was {{intimidated by}} her {{vitality}} and <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> removed himself from her life. On his recommendation, she turned creative control of Balzac's unfinished novels Le Député d'Arcis and Les Petits Bourgeois to another writer, Charles Rabou. Rabou added extensively {{to them and}} published both books in 1854. To soothe the publisher, Hańska falsely claimed that Balzac had chosen Rabou as his literary successor.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{recurring}} pattern of coups and counter-coups, {{that were a}} succession of increasingly authoritarian and corrupt governments all full of false promises of democracy and new starts. ‘Decalo lists the following reasons for African military coups: ethnic rivalries, intramilitary quarrels, personal <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> ambitions and personal fear’.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{have been}} telling myself, papa, all along; but, now that the day has come, and I have seen what <b>jealousies,</b> <b>and</b> competitions, and vanities, and disappointments it has produced--not even poor little Blanche allowed any comfort--I am almost sick at heart with {{thinking}} Cocksmoor was the excuse!" ...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is no}} way that architecture’s star system can prompt virtuous behaviour: it is more likely to trigger petty <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> an {{unhealthy}} ambition to emulate.|$|R
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, Jacob flies {{back to the}} United Kingdom for the appeal, but it is rejected. With their {{relationship}} compromised and no hope of resolving the visa issue, Anna and Jacob begin to fight with each other out of <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> frustration. Jacob {{goes back to the}} US, and Samantha. Anna eventually gets promoted at work to the position of editor—something she wanted very much. Her love life, however, is not as positive or fulfilling—her new boyfriend Simon (Charlie Bewley) does not evoke the same feelings in her as Jacob, whom she still misses.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
6000|$|When civil dudgeon first grew high, [...] And men fell out, {{they knew}} not why; [...] When foul words, <b>jealousies,</b> <b>and</b> fears, [...] Set folk {{together}} by the ears-- [...] --BUTLER.|$|R
60|$|Dor. 'Tis {{better as}} 'tis; we have drawn off already {{as much of}} our love as would run clear; after possessing, the rest is but <b>jealousies,</b> <b>and</b> disquiets, and quarrelling, and piecing.|$|R
60|$|The Lord of Stoutenburg {{felt that}} here in Gilda's {{presence}} he could forget his ambitions and his crimes, the man {{whom he was}} so foully putting to death, his <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> even his revenge.|$|R
5|$|While the {{publicity}} stunt placed Monroe on international front pages, it also {{marked the end}} of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was furious about the stunt. The union had been troubled from the start by his <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> controlling attitude; Spoto and Banner have also asserted that he was physically abusive. After returning to Hollywood, Monroe hired famous attorney Jerry Giesler and announced in October 1954 that she was filing for divorce. The Seven Year Itch was released the following June, and grossed over $4.5 million at the box office, {{making it one of the}} biggest commercial successes that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{legend of}} Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th {{century in the}} city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but on the first night of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E

50|$|When Vincente's {{handsome}} nephew {{shows up}} from the countryside, passions grow more heated, <b>and</b> closeted <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> rivalries of the students become unscaled. At the film's end, the leader Carla reveals a surprising fact about herself.|$|R
60|$|I will spare what I {{think of}} the {{treatment}} in England of the Savoy question. We are losing all moral prestige {{in the eyes of}} the world, with our small <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> factional struggles for power.|$|R
5|$|M. N. Rajam {{was cast}} as Manohari, {{the queen of}} Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a {{character}} driven by <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written {{in such a way}} that she would find it easier to pronounce them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R. Ramsingh was selected for the role of Madhana and Bhupathi's father, Veerabahu, after Ramachandran was impressed by his performance in one of the stage plays he featured in. J. P. Chandrababu played Veerangan's friend and sidekick, Sagayam. T. P. Muthulakshmi was cast as Nagamma, a native of Kanni Theevu, who wants a husband. G. Sakunthala played Manohari's lady-in-waiting Nandini and K. S. Angamuthu the restaurateur Pappa respectively.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E
5|$|When King Powhatan is {{presented}} with the captured Smith, he decides, {{at the urging of}} the tribe’s priest Grimosco, to execute him. Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian allies {{on the way back to}} the settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the attraction is mutual. They speak of love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives the news with anger, <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E
6000|$|Pala. Well, I'll {{say that}} for thee, thou art a very {{dexterous}} executioner; thou hast done my business at one stroke: yet I must marry another--and yet I must love this; and if it lead me into some little inconveniencies, as <b>jealousies,</b> <b>and</b> duels, and death, and so forth--yet, while sweet love is in the case, Fortune, do thy worst, and avaunt, mortality! ...|$|R
60|$|Waller {{lost his}} {{reputation}} in this fight, and was exceedingly slighted ever after, even {{by his own}} party; but especially by such as were of General Essex's party, between whom and Waller there had been <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> misunderstandings for some time.|$|R
60|$|Jac. I never trouble myself so long beforehand. <b>Jealousies</b> <b>and</b> disquiets are {{the dregs}} of an amour; but I'll leave mine before I have drawn it off so low. When it once grows troubled, I'll give vent to a fresh draught.|$|R
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
50|$|Also, Ida's {{beginning}} {{recognition as}} a jazz singer causes increased tension <b>and</b> <b>jealousy</b> between her <b>and</b> Vivaldo.|$|R
50|$|It {{cannot be}} doubted {{that much of}} the {{opposition}} which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable — the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> fears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? Well, she did not, neither did I. Indeed, {{she pointed out}} that this was her trouble. Among the great of the earth she knew no such man, and, if she sought lower, then would come <b>jealousies</b> <b>and</b> war." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria {{across the}} centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, {{stopping}} at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys {{to other parts of}} England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected {{on the grounds of the}} King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by <b>jealousy,</b> <b>and</b> forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.|$|E
5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of <b>jealousy</b> <b>and</b> obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
