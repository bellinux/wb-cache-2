5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> U.S. {{involvement}} in Zaire defies justification. It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the full measure of resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by the Administration is commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, then he should not qualify for any form of military assistance, lest the United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, inch by inch.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{favorite}} for the Republican nomination was the previous nominee, James G. Blaine of Maine. After Blaine wrote several letters denying {{any interest in}} the nomination, his supporters divided among other candidates, with John Sherman of Ohio as the leader among them. Others, including Chauncey Depew of New York, Russell Alger of Michigan, and Harrison's old nemesis Walter Q. Gresham, now a federal appellate court judge in Chicago, also sought the delegates' support at the 1888 Republican National Convention. Blaine did not publicly endorse any of the candidates as a successor; however, on March 1, 1888 he privately wrote that [...] "the one man remaining who <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment</b> can make the best one is Benjamin Harrison." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1569 the Northern Rebellion {{broke out}} with the aim to install Mary, Queen of Scots (who was in English captivity) on the English throne. The Earl of Warwick {{was one of the}} commanders {{appointed}} to march against the revolt, which was disintegrating rapidly, though. Due to his bad health Warwick was soon allowed to return to his Midlands estates. In January 1570 Robert, Earl of Leicester saw his reconvalescent brother at Kenilworth and reported to Elizabeth: [...] "all this hard weather [...] hath every day travelled on horse, Your Majesty's service hath made him forget his pain ... assuredly he is marvellous weary, though <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment</b> it hath done his body much good".|$|E

500|$|Krueger {{did what}} he could to {{accelerate}} the movement of units of Major General Innis P. Swift's 1st Cavalry Division to the Admiralty Islands in response to urgent pleas from Brigadier General William C. Chase, who managed to defeat the numerically superior Japanese forces. Krueger was unimpressed with Chase. [...] "His task", Krueger wrote to Swift, [...] "was undoubtedly a difficult one, but did not, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> warrant the nervousness apparent {{in some of his}} despatches. This, and his failure to obey repeated positive orders to furnish detailed information of his situation and his losses, his closing his radio station during long periods, and his evident ignorance that reinforcements could not reach him by the times he demanded, were not calculated to inspire confidence." ...|$|E
500|$|As Interior Secretary, Lane was {{responsible}} for the territories, and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory. While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska. In 1914, Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad, which passed the Senate following a two-day speech in support by Walsh. [...] Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident, John Franklin Alexander Strong, as territorial governor. [...] Secretary Lane's vision for the territory was, [...] "Alaska should not, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw. [...] She has the potentialities of a State. And whatever policies may be adopted should look toward an Alaska of homes, of industries, and of an extended commerce." ...|$|E
500|$|With Roosevelt's final public {{word on the}} matter, the {{controversy}} began to die down in earnest, although its key players continued {{to comment on the}} debate's major points for the next few years. The New York Times favored the President's position in an editorial titled [...] "The War of the Naturalists", while some still supported Long and his literary efforts. Long was traveling in Maine when Roosevelt's [...] "Nature Fakers" [...] article was published, and did not respond to the criticisms against him with his past vigor. He later wrote that [...] "the only fakir in the whole controversy, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> is the big fakir at Washington". Long's literary reputation steadily declined, although he continued to write and publish well into the early 1950s. For his remaining life, Burroughs continued to write disparagingly about the effect of sentimental animal stories. In his 1908 book Leaf And Tendril, he wrote: ...|$|E

I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Then-president George W. Bush, {{when asked}} whether he would watch the film, responded: [...] "Doubt it." [...] “New {{technologies}} will change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment</b> we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
