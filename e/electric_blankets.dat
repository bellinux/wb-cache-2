The first <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> {{was invented in}} 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell.

He soon finds out that cows have found an old {{typewriter}} in the barn, and are using it to type notes requesting things from Farmer Brown such as <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> to keep them warm at night. Farmer Brown refuses, so the cows, {{who are willing to}} withhold their milk until they get what they ask for, go on strike. Soon, the hens type a similar note asking for <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> as well, and after Farmer Brown furiously refuses to provide them, the hens go on strike as well and refuse to lay eggs.Farmer Brown realizes this makes it impossible to run a farm. In a furious attempt to re-establish normalcy, he uses another typewriter to send a note back to the cows, declaring they do not need the things they are asking for and that their job is to produce milk and eggs so he can run his farm. The cows hold an emergency meeting, {{at the end of which}} they seemingly come to a resolution. They promise the farmer that if he gives them <b>electric</b> <b>blankets,</b> they will give up their typewriter. A duck who acts as a neutral party agrees to deliver the typewriter when the cows have received the electric blankets.Farmer Brown decides the deal is fair, so he leaves <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> for the cows and waits for the duck to deliver the typewriter. Instead, the ducks send him a note which states that their pond is boring and they would like a diving board, at which point the story ends.|$|E
50|$|Much like heating pads, <b>electric</b> <b>blankets</b> use an {{insulated}} wire or heating element inserted into a fabric that heats {{when it is}} plugged in.

40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with endogenous and exogenous estrogen excess. Some investigators have posited that electromagnetic fields may influence cancer risk through estrogenic hormonal mechanisms; however, {{there have been no}} studies reporting on <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> exposure in relation to endometrial cancer. The authors examined this possible association between endometrial cancer risk and <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> or mattress cover use as part of a population-based, case-control study. This analysis included incident endometrial cancer cases 40 – 79 years of age, interviewed during 1994 (n = 148; response rate, 87 %) and identified from the Wisconsin tumor registry. Female controls of similar age were randomly selected from population lists (n = 659; response rate, 85 %). Information regarding <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> and mattress cover use and endometrial cancer risk factors was obtained through structured telephone interviews approximately 1 year after diagnosis. After adjustment for age, body mass index, and postmenopausal hormone use, the risk of endometrial cancer was similar among ever users (odds ratio = 1. 04, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 70, 1. 55) and among current users (odds ratio = 0. 87, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 49, 1. 54) as compared with never users. Despite its small size and potential misclassification of exposure, this study provides evidence against an association between <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> or mattress cover use and endometrial cancer.

40|$|AbstractWe {{conducted}} a prospective, randomized trial of three methods of rewarming patients after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients underwent either {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting or first-time valve replacement and were cooled to 32 º C during bypass. No significant differences existed among the groups as regards operative or preoperative parameters including hemodynamics and blood use. The patients actively warmed with a convective (Bair Hugger system, 3 hours) or a conductive <b>blanket</b> (<b>electric</b> overblanket, 4 hours) reached normothermia more quickly than those warmed with the space blanket (7 hours). This was reflected in significantly earlier extubation in the former two groups: Bair Hugger system 10. 8 ± 0. 6 hours, <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> 11. 3 ± 1. 0 hours, and space blanket 14. 8 ± 0. 8 hours. Patients warmed with the space blanket required a higher dosage of morphine over the first 12 hours than those warmed with the <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> (10. 4 vs 6. 5 mg; p = 0. 004), which may account {{for some of the}} differences between these two groups. No differences could be demonstrated between the two active blankets. On economic grounds we therefore recommend the reusable <b>electric</b> <b>blanket</b> for routine use.

50|$|A typical Bert and Ernie skit has Ernie {{coming up}} with a hare brained idea, and Bert trying {{to talk him out of}} it, ending with Bert losing his temper and Ernie {{remaining}} unaware of the results of his own bad idea.

When he shows the ice cubes to Bert, he finds out that they have melted into water. Bert knows what happened, and tries to tell Ernie that his ice cubes melted because of the <b>electric</b> <b>blanket,</b> but Ernie takes this to mean that a fish from the ocean came into the apartment and melted his ice cubes, and vows to find the (non existent) fish that melted them.|$|R
