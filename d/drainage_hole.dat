50|$|Re-potting: Potting Terrestrial Orchids Good {{drainage}} is important. Mix 3 parts fibrous peat, 3 parts coarse grit, 1 part perlite, and 1 part charcoal. Select a pot {{that will}} accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make {{sure that it}} has a <b>drainage</b> <b>hole.</b> Hold the orchid over the pot so that the crown is just below the rim of the pot. With your other hand, fill pot with moistened soil mix, tamping to firm. There really is no need to add crockery {{to the bottom of the}} pot, but you may want to add a small square of wire mesh or other permiable fabric over hole in bottom of pot. Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part coarse grit or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure {{that it has a}} <b>drainage</b> <b>hole.</b> Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits down sides. Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot. With other hand, fill pot with moistened bark mix, tamping to firm. Some epiphytes do not need to be potted and prefer to grow on a mound or slab of bark. Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.|$|E

This work was conducted through numerical analysis by finite element method to evaluate the hydraulic uplift pressure distribution generated by the calculated flow.

Uplift and pore water pressures are the main hydraulic factors to be considered in the design of hydraulic structures.

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Gas {{drainage}} {{has been}} the most common technique for gas management in underground coal mines. This method involves drilling holes into a virgin coal seam to allow the gas bleed off from the coal into the drainage holes. A major problem with the underground gas drainage is the air leakage around the gas <b>drainage</b> <b>hole</b> that cannot be blocked off by the sealing material. The air leakage will cause the low concentration of the drained gas and decrease the efficiency of the gas <b>drainage</b> <b>hole,</b> which may further lead to many other risks, such as spontaneous combustion, gas combustion and gas explosions. A thin spray-on liner is defined as a chemical-based layer or coating (3 - 5 mm) that is sprayed onto the rock surface to support mining excavations. Since their introduction, thin spray-on liners have received some success as a ground support tool for underground mining. Besides ground support, thin spray-on liners also show some potential {{to be used as a}} gas management tool in underground coal mines due to their relatively low permeability. This paper describes a field trial of using thin spray-on liners for enhancing the gas drainage efficiency by blocking the fractures around the drainage holes. The project involves spraying a thin spray-on liner onto the area surrounding gas drainage holes whereby the thin spray-on liner acts as a thin membrane decreasing the permeability of coal. This restricts the air migrating through the coal seam and diluting the gas from the drainage holes. The key benefits associated with the application of TSLs are the increase in the methane purity and the decrease in the air contamination. In-situ adhesion tests were conducted in parallel with the gas tests, and the results revealed that the TSL tested could be implemented for underground coal mine applications as the main failure mode is the internal failure of the coal substrate...|$|E
