2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s Garcke and Fells, had {{developed}} a system of <b>factory</b> <b>accounting,</b> and pictured its elements in four complementary flow diagrams. In 1896 J. Slater Lewis further developed this system, and pictured a diagram of manufacturing accounts, in which the four diagrams were integrated into one whole. A decennium later Alexander Hamilton Church (1908/10) would further develop this system by introducing the concept of production factors, and picturing the [...] "Principles of Organization by Production Factors" [...] around any organization. Using this concept of production factors Church was able to simplify the system of manufacturing accounts to a [...] "Systems of Controlling Accounts." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} developments in this volume is his distinction between operating departments and service or indirect departments with respect to the allocation of overhead. Another historically important contribution is the integration of the <b>factory</b> <b>accounting</b> with the general financial ledger through the use of reciprocal accounts.But Nicholson went well beyond the treatment of [...] "what are costs" [...] and [...] "how to account for costs." [...] He was deeply interested in factory organization as such, and in the relationship of the cost department with the other departments in a company. The reader can infer this emphasis from the [...] "factory organization" [...] part of the title of his first book. A large part of his consulting practice was devoted to problems of organization and management.|$|E

50|$|<b>Factory</b> <b>accounting</b> {{software}} {{was among the}} most popular of early business software tools, and included the automation of general ledgers, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).|$|E
5000|$|In <b>factory</b> <b>accounting</b> more cost {{books are}} being used {{corresponding}} to the different divisions of the factory: There are the [...] "Stores Ledger," [...] the [...] "Cost Ledger," [...] and the [...] "Stock Ledger."

5000|$|The whole system, {{introduced}} in the 1885 publication, was summarized in the 1886 article, entitled [...] "Metcalfes cost of manufactures" [...] in the journal Mechanics.

In preparing such a chart, the accounts should be given symbol numbers. It may be noted that <b>factory</b> ledger controlling <b>accounts</b> vary in number from the three simple accounts previously described to several hundred.|$|R
50|$|Frank E. Webner's 1917 book {{entitled}} <b>Factory</b> <b>Accounting</b> formed {{one of the}} texts on higher accountancy of the La Salle Extension University. As it is generally understood, the primary use to which all of these texts were to be put was correspondence instruction. A growing secondary consideration in offering them to the public was that they supplied a need, very real in some quarters, for satisfactory texts for School and collegiate instruction.|$|E
50|$|One {{acquainted with}} Webner's earlier volume, Factory Costs, misses {{in the present}} volume much of the well thought out and philosophic {{treatment}} of the troublesome problem of burden application so ably presented there. The difference in scope and purpose of the two books accounts for its omission from the present volume. On the whole <b>Factory</b> <b>Accounting</b> is an able presentation of the subject of costs, is somewhat broader than the usual treatment, and should prove a satisfactory text for students.|$|E
5000|$|With the emerge {{of larger}} machine shops mid 19th century {{accounting}} methods developed in larger farm companies were {{applied in the}} growing industry. In his 1885 book on <b>factory</b> <b>accounting</b> Metcalfe gave a description of normal system of labour registration mid 1870s:The timekeeper, generally the foreman, goes about the shop towards {{the close of the}} day and asks each workman how he has spent it according to the workman's recollection he enters the time reported in a book, as hereafter described.|$|E
50|$|J.

Burton's Commercial Management of Engineering Works (1899). and others. Those works contributed significantly to the establishment the new discipline of cost accounting.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a diagram}} of {{manufacturing}} accounts, Slater Lewis explained how [...] "scheme {{of production and}} cost control is unfolded in its logical flow."
