25|$|Excavations {{carried out}} in 1934 by H. E. Kilbride-Jones {{on behalf of the}} Ministry of Works, showed that the circle was built in stages.

Then came the outer stones, with their bases shaped into points to make them more stable in their <b>gravel</b> <b>bed.</b> They have been {{somewhat}} eroded over time by acidic peat eating away the lower portions of the stones. Oak and hazel were burned within the stone rings, leaving charcoal behind, and cremated human bones were deposited in the ashes within five of the rings.

Varney Airlines began operating out of Boise in 1933, later merging with National Air Transport to become United Airlines. Since United traces its roots to Varney, United is recognized as the airline that has operated the longest out of Boise, 91 years as of 2017. United Airlines has contracted out its airport operation to SkyWest Airlines and no longer has any active employees in the State of Idaho, although as of May 2016 United Airlines operates two daily mainline flights between Boise (BOI) and Denver (DEN). The airfield also played host to Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis on September 4, 1927.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of an {{anadromous}} salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a <b>gravel</b> <b>bed</b> in {{the upper reaches of}} a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called sac fry or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called fry. At {{the end of the summer}} the fry develop into juvenile fish called parr. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.|$|E
500|$|Cave Junction has {{a number}} of {{historic}} sites related to its early gold mining days, including various mines, ditches, and Logan Cut. [...] The historic Osgood Ditch in Takilma provided water for early mining operations in the Illinois Valley. [...] Although mining in the Illinois Valley started in the rivers, gold was soon discovered in gravel beds high up the slopes above the rivers. [...] It had been deposited by ancient rivers that then eroded deep into the earth. [...] To extract this gold, prospectors created ditches to bring the water to these areas. [...] The water was then moved through piping to the desired location. [...] The pressure the water built up as it dropped was used for hydraulic mining. [...] Water cannons fired water over , and the debris was run through a sluice box. [...] Gold was located within pockets in the gravel, and because the miners could not predict where the pockets were, almost every gravel deposit in the Illinois Valley was mined. [...] The Illinois Valley's largest gold rush town, Waldo, Oregon, was located on a gravel deposit and was eventually destroyed when its <b>gravel</b> <b>bed</b> was run through a sluice box, along with most of the town. [...] Today nothing of Waldo remains. [...] The Osgood Ditch provided water for mining operations near Waldo.

2500|$|For {{the case}} in which sand {{fraction}} is transported by the current over and through an immobile <b>gravel</b> <b>bed,</b> Kuhnle et al.(2013), following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011), provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle et al. (2013) applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula to their experimental data {{and found out that}} predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became {{near the top of the}} gravel layer. They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula [...] was larger than that available for transport within the <b>gravel</b> <b>bed</b> because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.|$|E
