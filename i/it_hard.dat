5|$|After {{law school}} {{he passed the}} bar and began {{practicing}} law in Portland, Oregon in 1939. He found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which makes <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time {{to carry out the}} works. In July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E

She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which {{is known for its}} flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E

5|$|Harvard {{refused to}} attend the rules conference {{organized}} by the other schools and continued to play under its own code.

Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, {{did not have a}} winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E

In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma is hard to culture and that strain variation makes <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E
