40|$|Master's thesis in FinanceThis thesis {{investigates the}} future {{development}} of industrial robots in China. It {{will focus on}} growth in robot sales toward China and try to identify which companies that are most capable of benefiting from the potential growth. A triangulation approach is applied, where both qualitative and quantitative methods is utilized. SWOT, discrete data and panel data analysis supports our conclusion about a strong growth in China. Porter`s Five Forces and financial analysis have pointed out interesting companies relative to China, such as the German based company KUKA. The thesis uses interviews as a source to qualitative information, adding <b>firsthand</b> business <b>knowledge</b> about the subject. In addition, quantitative data have been collected from The International Federation of Robotics and Morgan Stanley research department. From 2005 - 2013 the robot sale in China has increased with a compounded annual growth rate of 30 %. The key result suggests that the current situation in China indicates a promising future growth of industrial robots. The growth potential in China is {{a direct consequence of}} the small robot density in the country, compared to other industrialized countries. China is a manufacturing –based and export-oriented economy. Modernization of the manufacturing sector in China needs flexibility and effectivity upgrades. The aging population together with rising wages are necessitating automation of production processes. The tremendous growth experienced in the automobile industry intensifying the opportunity to robotize. The automotive industry has the highest density of industrial robots. The thesis also concludes that domestic robot producers and the foreign company KUKA should experience a rapid growth in sales {{as a consequence of the}} growth in the Chinese market. Further analysis on domestic companies is required to explore potential domestic investment objects.

40|$|Serious {{soil erosion}} {{occurred}} in the South Downs National Park, southern England in the years 1982 – 2006 and details of around 400 sites are contained in a database.

At 79 % of the sites land use change had resulted in a reduction in the risk of erosion, most notably at 28 sites with a shift to permanent grass from winter cereals. At only 21 % of sites was the risk of erosion unchanged. Twenty two farmers responsible for 66 of the sites were interviewed. Land management practices had changed on all of the fields of interest to this study since the time of the serious erosion events, to those which have the potential to lower soil erosion risk. Sixteen interviewees claimed that erosion was a motivating reason for changing their practices, due to either experiencing on or on- and off-farm impacts <b>firsthand</b> (12), having <b>knowledge</b> or suspicion of serious erosion having occurred on their land prior to their management (three), or having no knowledge of any serious erosion on their land but just wanting to reduce overall erosion risk (one). Amongst the main changes reported are changes of land use from winter cereals to grass or to overwinter stubble which have undoubtedly reduced the risk of erosion. However, some changed practices claimed by farmers, such as along-the-contour-working, earlier sowing and the use of rollers may be of little value. Furthermore, deeper analysis of farmers’ motivations regarding changes in land management practices suggests a complex picture in which a range of socio-economic influences come into play over time including financial incentives offered by agri-environmental schemes which were found to be an important driver of change. Future changes in farming economics may therefore undermine the reduction in erosion risk in the longer term...|$|R

Its Indigenous tribes have a rich plant folklore culture. The Indigenous Bioresources Research Group (IBRG) of Macquarie University have established a collaborative research partnership with Chungtia village, Nagaland, with the objectives of documenting <b>firsthand</b> ethnobotanical plant <b>knowledge</b> of Chungtia village and investigating the chemical and biological properties of selected plants. This study consisted of three interrelated aspects, namely ethnobotanical research, biological studies, and isolation and characterisation of bioactive constituents from Nagaland medicinal plants. An ethnobotanical research of Nagaland medicinal plants used by Chungtia village was conducted {{with the cooperation of}} Chungtia villagers. This resulted in the documentation of 135 plants. These plants were taxonomically identified and voucher specimens were deposited at Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Shillong, India, for future reference. Of these 135 plants, 39 plants have been previously reported for similar ethnomedicinal uses elsewhere in Nagaland, 61 plants have been previously reported in Nagaland for different ethnobotanical purposes, and 35 plants appear to have novel ethnomedicinal uses in Nagaland. Thirty five plants were documented for their use in skin related treatments and literature searches on these plants indicated 16 plants with either no antibacterial or phytochemical studies previously reported. This led to the selection of eight plants for antibacterial screening with priority given to those plants that were reported as treatments for skin diseases. Three plants were also selected from the literature on Nagaland medicinal plants for antibacterial activity studies. The antibacterial screenings were performed on 11 plants against three pathogenic microorganisms, i. e. S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, by using disc diffusion and MTT microdilution assays. All of the eight plants used by Chungtia villagers showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, at concentrations less than 2. 5 mg/ml. The highest inhibitory activities were exhibited by the stem bark of Erythrina stricta and the roots of Prunus persica, with MIC values of 156 μg/ml and 312 μg/ml, respectively. Based on the antibacterial screening results, the stem bark of E. stricta, root bark of P. persica and root bark of Diospyros lanceifolia were selected for further biological and chemical investigations of their antibacterial constituents. The bioassay guided isolation of the dichloromethane partition of the ethanolic extract of the stem bark of E. stricta led to the isolation of 11 compounds: the flavanones 5 -hydroxysophoranone and maackiaflavanone B, the isoflavones chandalone, alpinumisoflavone and lupalbigenin, and the pterocarpans 1 -methoxyerythrabyssin II, erythrabyssin II, erystagallin A, phaseollidin, cristacarpin and 2 -(γ,γ-dimethylallyl) - 6 a-hydroxyphaseollidin. This is the first reported isolation of any of these 11 compounds from the stem bark of this plant. The antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated against four different strains of S. aureus including two drug-resistant strains. The most potent inhibition was shown by lupalbigenin. Compounds 1 -methoxyerythrabyssin II, erythrabyssin II, erystagallin A, cristacarpin and 2 -(γ,γ-dimethylallyl) - 6 a-hydroxyphaseollidin were active against all of the strains. The ethyl acetate fraction of the root bark of P. persica led to the isolation of afzelechin and entepiafzelechin-(2 α→O→ 7, 4 α→ 8) -(-) -afzelechin. This is the first report of ent-epiafzelechin-(2 α→O→ 7, 4 α→ 8) -(-) -afzelechin isolation from P. persica. The two compounds were tested for antibacterial activities against eight bacteria, including both Gram-positive and-Gram negative bacteria and two methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, but they were found to be not active even at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Examination of the n-hexane fraction of the root bark of D. lanceifolia, which showed activity against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa in the disc diffusion assay, led to the isolation of the two antibacterial compounds plumbagin and 7 -methyljuglone. Plumbagin and 7 -methyljuglone were tested against eight microorganisms including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and two MRSA strains to expand the current bioactivity data on these compounds. Plumbagin showed more potent and broad spectrum activity than 7 -methyljuglone. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xiii, 212 pages) illustrations (some colour...|$|R
40|$|In Western Samoa, {{programmes}} {{for farmers}} are relayed from island to island by two telecommunications satellites. In Senegal, rural radio has been transmitting in seven languages {{for the last}} 20 years, while in the Central African Republic rural radio is just starting and in Djibouti, a project should begin soon. In Mauritania, an important rural radio project {{is coming to an}} end for lack of funds and in Burkina Faso, the decentralization of radio services is making progress despite some difficulties. With so many different circumstances, is it possible to find a common denominator for Rural Radio in ACP countries? Rural radio services, sensu stricto, that are decentralized, financially and technically self-sufficient, that transmit only for farmers in their own language and that provide for all their information and entertainment needs, are almost unheard of in ACP countries. One common problem is the lack of resources: both the material means to record and broadcast, as well as the logistic means to obtain information from the rural environment where enthusiastic reporters need and wish to work. In collaboration with CIERRO (Centre Interaficain d'etudes en radio rurale de Ougadougou) and GRET (Groupe de recherches et d'echanges technologiques) in Paris, CTA gathered rural broadcasters from 18 ACP countries in the capital city of Burkina Faso from May 15 to 18 1989. The aim of the workshop was to identify more clearly the constraints to radio broadcasting of scientific and technical information (STI) and at setting up a programme of action. According to the reports by the broadcasters during the workshop, people working in rural radio lack access to scientific and technical information despite all the meetings and reports that are published and that should be available. National documentation centres are inaccessible, communication with the national scientific and technical community is inefficient and specialized books and magazines are rare in the libraries. The main sources of scientific and technical information for rural radio are the rural areas. Frequently, broadcasters are left to work as best they can without assistance or encouragement; too often they are disregarded and, more seriously, they feel and become isolated. Those who still have the means to go to the field have at least the possibility of gathering <b>firsthand</b> information and <b>knowledge</b> from the farmers. But even if their audience is their chief source of information, rural radio broadcasters are eager for contact with the outside world. But here again they often meet with silence. At the workshop, the representatives of 18 countries unanimously indicated that, despite the existence of several international information services, their needs are far from being satisfied. Improved access to sources of information is in fact at the top of the list in the final resolutions. With limited access to the field, and cut off from the world of research, rural radio services are reduced to play one role: to act as a conveyor belt to transmit agricultural services to farmers. This task, on its own, seems insufficient to them. Reporters are ready to participate in campaigns to raise public awareness of major issues - environment, hygiene, training, etc - and even to contribute to the dissemination of technical information produced by agricultural services. Militant in the cause of the people they serve and that of development, they would like to be complete reporters, and to provide true, up-to-date, current and useful information. Refresher courses, to keep rural broadcasters up to date, would be very beneficial. Even though in one of the resolutions participants asked for radios to be provided more cheaply to farmers to improve their impact, reporters know that it is the content of their programmes that will attract listeners. However, to improve the content of their broadcasts, they have to break out of their isolation. This is why they have overwhelmingly requested to be kept in touch with current scientific, technical and economic progress in the world. They would like to receive in good time despatches on product prices and markets, weather forecasts and warnings about pests and to exchange their reports and their experience with colleagues in other countries. Among the important final resolutions, the participants asked for a system for the exchange of programmes between rural radio services to be set up. South-South and North-South, the information circuits on 'Field', 'Lab', 'Magnetic discs' end 'Hard Copy' should be multiplied and operate more freely. In industrial countries, journalism is the art of making choices. In developing countries, it is the art of making do. Before the meeting, CTA believed a need existed. It is now aware that this is a priority and will tackle it in collaboration with ail concerned by this problem.

In response to a direct question from Rather about the authenticity of the memo on Bush's alleged insubordination, she stated that no such memo was ever written; she further emphasized that she would have known if such a memo existed, as she had sole responsibility to type Killian's memos in that time period. At this point, she also admitted she had no <b>firsthand</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Bush's time in the Guard. However, controversially, Knox said later in the interview, [...] "The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real ones." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I probably typed the information and somebody picked up the information some way or another." [...] The New York Times headline report on this interview, including the phrase [...] "Fake but Accurate," [...] created an immediate backlash from critics of CBS's broadcast. The conservative-leaning Weekly Standard proceeded to predict the end of CBS's news division.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the art of falconry may have begun in Mesopotamia, with the earliest accounts dating to approximately 2,000 BC. [...] There are also some raptor representations in the northern Altai, western Mongolia. The falcon was a symbolic bird of ancient Mongol tribes. [...] There is some disagreement about whether such early accounts document the practice of falconry (from The Epic of Gilgamesh and others) or are misinterpreted depictions of humans with birds of prey. During the Turkic Period of Central Asia (7th century AD), concrete figures of falconer on horseback were described on the rocks in Kyrgyz. [...] Falconry was probably introduced to Europe around AD 400, when the Huns and Alans invaded from the East. Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194–1250) is generally acknowledged as the most significant wellspring of traditional falconry knowledge. He {{is believed to have}} obtained <b>firsthand</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Arabic falconry during wars in the region (between June 1228 – June 1229). He obtained a copy of Moamyn's manual on falconry and had it translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch. Frederick II himself made corrections to the translation in 1241 resulting in De Scientia Venandi per Aves. [...] King Frederick II is most recognized for his falconry treatise, De arte venandi cum avibus ("The Art of Hunting with Birds"). [...] Written himself {{toward the end of his}} life, it is widely accepted as the first comprehensive book of falconry, but also notable in its contributions to ornithology and zoology. De arte venandi cum avibus incorporated a diversity of scholarly traditions from east to west, and is one of the earliest challenges to Aristotle's explanations of nature.|$|E
2500|$|The floods were {{a result}} of heavy {{rainfall}} caused by Tropical Cyclone Tasha that combined with a trough during the peak of a La Niña Modoki event. The 2010 La Niña Modoki weather pattern, which brings wetter conditions to eastern Australia, was the strongest since 1973. This La Niña event caused a prolonged event of heavy rainfall over Queensland river catchments. Record or near to record sea surface temperatures were recorded off the Queensland coast in late 2010. December 2010 was Queensland's wettest on record, with record-high rainfall totals set in 107 locations for the month. The state's average rainfall level of [...] exceeded the previous record of [...] set in 1975. 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900 and the Australian continent's third-wettest year. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thought climate change was a contributing factor in the unusually high precipitation rates. He attributed a half-degree Celsius rise in ocean temperatures around Australia to global warming which produces extra water vapour and intensifies the monsoon. Other scientists {{say that it is}} too early to draw such a conclusion. Assertions were also made by Professor Hubert Chanson, an expert in dam and reservoir engineering with extensive <b>firsthand</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the Wivenhoe system, that mismanagement of the Wivenhoe Dam might be a contributor to the some flooding in the lower Brisbane valley. While an expert engineer, Michael O'Brien—a senior manager of an ASX-listed resources company and an outside consultant evaluating cause—agrees that [...] "massive releases of water from Wivenhoe Dam on Tuesday, January 11, did indeed produce most of the flooding in the Brisbane River the following afternoon, with a peak in the early hours of Thursday morning, January 13. The dam's releases into the Brisbane River also caused the Bremer River, which winds through the city of Ipswich, and the Lockyer Creek to back up and cause much of the flooding outside Brisbane." [...] This was corroborated by a panel of engineers hired by Insurance Council of Australia. O'Brien also found that the Wivenhoe Dam and Somerset Dam did not hold the maximum capacity they were capable of holding during the crisis period, which would have significantly alleviated flooding. Only one source, Neal Ashkanasy, who specialises in social and organisational psychology (and 35 years ago was involved in the design of Wivenhoe Dam), found fault with these results and instead finds that the dam was operated correctly throughout the time of the storm and the flood that followed, saying the [...] "dam was run with outstanding precision." ...|$|E
60|$|Persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn {{and lonely}} man {{made no attempt}} at retaliation. All his life he had been sinned against, and all his life he had sinned against no one. But his cup of {{bitterness}} was not yet full to overflowing. Having lost his position, and being without any income, {{he had to find}} work. His first place was at the Union Iron Works, in San Francisco, where he proved a most able draughtsman. It was here that he obtained his <b>firsthand</b> <b>knowledge</b> of battleships and their construction. But the reporters discovered him and featured him in his new vocation. He immediately resigned and found another place; but after the reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen positions, he steeled himself to brazen out the newspaper persecution. This occurred when he started his electroplating establishment--in Oakland, on Telegraph Avenue. It was a small shop, employing three men and two boys. Gluck himself worked long hours. Night after night, as Policeman Carew testified on the stand, he did not leave the shop till one and two in the morning. It was during this period that he perfected the improved ignition device for gas- engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him wealthy.|$|E
