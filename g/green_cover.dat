By the autumn of 1984, Ride the Lightning had moved 85,000 copies in Europe, resulting in Metallica's first cover story for Kerrang! in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single [...] "Creeping Death" [...] in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. In 1984, the French record label Bernett Records misprinted the color of the album cover in green, rather than blue, and 400 copies with the <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> were produced. Because of their rarity, these green albums have become collectors' items. Ride the Lightning went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping six million copies in the US. The album, along with Kill 'Em All, was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on IGN Music's [...] "Top 25 Metal Albums" [...] list. Spin listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it [...] "the thrashiest thrash ever". According to Guitar World, Ride the Lightning [...] "didn't just change the band's trajectory—it reset the course of metal itself". Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press considers Ride the Lightning the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as crossover thrash and hardcore punk.

The album's original cover, which pictured two babies wearing diapers (nappies) in the flags of the Soviet Union and United States, was banned in the GDR; legend has it this was due to the presence of the American flag, not to the context.

It sloped down into a wide hollow and up another bare slope. The ground was littered with bleached logs, trees that had been killed first by fire and then felled by wind. Here and there a lofty, spectral trunk still withstood the blasts. Across the hollow sloped a considerable area where all trees were dead and still standing--a melancholy sight. Beyond, and far round and down to the left, opened up a slope of spruce and bare ridge, where a few cedars showed dark, and then came black, spear-tipped forest again, leading the eye to the magnificent panorama of endless range on range, purple in the distance.|$|E

A grey parrot in a cage by the window cracked seed and looked out into the room with a satirical eye. He had seen all this so many times before--Nelly Bryant arraying herself in her smartest clothes to go out and besiege agents in their offices off the Strand. It happened every day. In an hour or two she would come back as usual, say [...] "Oh, Gee!" [...] in a tired sort of voice, and then Bill the parrot's day proper would begin.

40|$|Soil {{management}} {{is one of}} the key practices that influence vegetative and reproductive activity of the olive tree. Tillage, <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> (permanent or temporary), herbicide applications and mulching are all used in olive growing, although tillage is still the preferred method worldwide. Tillage allows to remove weeds, supply fertilizers easily, store precipitation water, and favours mineralization of organic matter. Yet, tillage promotes erosion in sloping areas with considerable soil losses. <b>Green</b> <b>covers</b> reduce erosion and ease trafficking of machinery when the soil is moist, as it often happens at harvesting. However, permanent <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> increase water consumption and this may be detrimental in arid climates. Herbicide applications and mulching are no so common as tillage or <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> in Italian olive orchards. Herbicides eliminate weeds but have a greater environmental impact than other methods of soil management. Herbicides are often used only along the tree row-combined with intercropping or tillage in the inter-row to reduce chemical inputs in the orchard. Mulching with polyethylene sheets is mainly limited by the cost and difficulty of disposing plastic sheets, whereas mulching with organic material is limited to family-run olive orchards because of shortage of mulching material.

60|$|I {{used to go}} at {{all hours}} of the day, hoping the mother would get used to me and my canoe, so that I could watch her later, {{teaching}} her little ones; but her wildness was unconquerable. Whenever I came in sight of the nest-bog, with only the loon's neck and head visible, standing up very straight and still in the grass, I would see her slip from the nest, steal away through the <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> to a deep place, and glide under water without leaving a ripple. Then, looking sharp over the side into the clear water, I would get a glimpse of her, just a gray streak with a string of silver bubbles, passing deep and swift under my canoe. So she went through the opening, and appeared far out in the lake, where she would swim back and forth, as if fishing, until I went away. As I never disturbed her nest, and always paddled away soon, she thought undoubtedly that she had fooled me, and that I knew nothing about her or her nest.|$|E
6000|$|Well, now, {{if you had}} {{to choose}} your team whom would you put in? You have not really a large choice. What are the points by which you judge them? You want strength, novelty, compactness, {{intensity}} of interest, a single vivid impression left upon the mind. Poe is the master of all. I may remark by the way that it is the sight of his <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> the next in order upon my favourite shelf, which has started this train of thought. Poe is, to my mind, the supreme original short story writer of all time. His brain was like a seed-pod full of seeds which flew carelessly around, and from which have sprung nearly all our modern types of story. Just think of what he did in his offhand, prodigal fashion, seldom troubling to repeat a success, but pushing on to some new achievement. To him must be ascribed the monstrous progeny of writers on the detection of crime--"quorum pars parva fui!" [...] Each may find some little development of his own, but his main art must trace back to those admirable stories of Monsieur Dupin, so wonderful in their masterful force, their reticence, their quick dramatic point. After all, mental acuteness is the one quality which can be ascribed to the ideal detective, and when that has once been admirably done, succeeding writers must necessarily be content for all time to follow in the same main track. But not only is Poe the originator of the detective story; all treasure-hunting, cryptogram-solving yarns trace back to his [...] "Gold Bug," [...] just as all pseudo-scientific Verne-and-Wells stories have their prototypes in the [...] "Voyage to the Moon," [...] and the [...] "Case of Monsieur Valdemar." [...] If every man who receives a cheque for a story which owes its springs to Poe were to pay tithe to a monument for the master, he would have a pyramid as big as that of Cheops.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{he wanted}} was {{comprised}} moreover in a single boon--the common unattainable art of taking things as they came. He appeared to himself to have given his best years to an active appreciation {{of the way they}} didn't come; but perhaps--as they would seemingly here be things quite other--this long ache might at last drop to rest. He could easily see that from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed collapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories. Oh if he SHOULD do the sum no slate would hold the figures! The fact that he had failed, as he considered, in everything, in each relation and in half a dozen trades, as he liked luxuriously to put it, might have made, might still make, for an empty present; but it stood solidly for a crowded past. It had not been, so much achievement missed, a light yoke nor a short load. It was at present as if the backward picture had hung there, the long crooked course, grey in the shadow of his solitude. It had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude, a solitude of life or choice, of community; but though there had been people enough all round it there had been but three or four persons IN it. Waymarsh was one of these, and the fact struck him just now as marking the record. Mrs. Newsome was another, and Miss Gostrey had of a sudden shown signs of becoming a third. Beyond, behind them was the pale figure of his real youth, which held against its breast the two presences paler than itself--the young wife he had early lost and the young son he had stupidly sacrificed. He had again and again made out for himself that he might have kept his little boy, his little dull boy who had died at school of rapid diphtheria, if he had not in those years so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother. It was the soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not really been dull--had been dull, as he had been banished and neglected, mainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish. This was doubtless but the secret habit of sorrow, which had slowly given way to time; yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit, at the sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up, wince with the thought of an opportunity lost. Had ever a man, he had finally fallen into the way of asking himself, lost so much and even done so much for so little? There had been particular reasons why all yesterday, beyond other days, he should have had in one ear this cold enquiry. His name on the <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> where he had put it for Mrs. Newsome, expressed him doubtless just enough to make the world--the world as distinguished, both for more and for less, from Woollett--ask who he was. He had incurred the ridicule of having to have his explanation explained. He was Lambert Strether because he was on the cover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory, that he was on the cover because he was Lambert Strether. He would have done anything for Mrs. Newsome, have been still more ridiculous--as he might, for that matter, have occasion to be yet; which came to saying that this acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fifty-five.|$|E
