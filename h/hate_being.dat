500|$|The [...] are a reptilian race living {{almost twice}} as long as Humes. Being a very {{socially}} and cognitively advanced race, they <b>hate</b> <b>being</b> called [...] "lizards" [...] as this is regarded as an offensive slur. Bangaa in Final Fantasy XII are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society, and are the race most friendly with the latter, as exemplified with Migelo. Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters. However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing. Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells. To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use. They are also said to be distantly related to lizard men.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Her performance garnered positive {{reviews from}} critics, who considered {{it one of}} the highlights in the event. Performing barefoot, Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience. Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>being</b> all dressed up, so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all over my face was definitely the highlight of my evening!"

500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We <b>hate</b> <b>being</b> trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Okereke is {{extremely}} shy. He has expressed disdain for interviews, asking one interviewer from Skyscraper magazine, [...] "Why {{is it important}} to know what I had for breakfast? Or who I went to bed with? Or what sneakers I am wearing? If it's relevant to understanding my music, then so be it. But if it's purely to satisfy the media's obsession with celebrity, then no thanks. I don't want to play that game." [...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I <b>hate</b> <b>being</b> approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005. In 2005 Okereke appeared on the front cover of Australian queer zine They Shoot Homos Don't They? ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics, {{including}} former feminist colleagues, concluded that she reinforced the stereotypes she sought to subvert. As {{was the case}} for other women artists that were reclaiming their bodies through their art practice, she was accused of regressive female narcissism. Chadwick declared that [...] "I'm disappointed that a false rationalism is used as a stick with which to measure what I'm doing when I am looking to cross the taboos that have been instigated. I <b>hate</b> <b>being</b> hauled up as an example of negative women's work." [...] In 1988 Chadwick made a conscious decision [...] "...not to represent my body.... It immediately declares female gender and I wanted to be more deft." [...] Her practice then moved inside the body to flesh in her Meat Abstracts (1989) and Meat Lamps (1989-91) and to bodily excrement’s in Piss Flowers (1991–92). Chadwick commented, [...] "I felt compelled to use materials that were still bodily, that were still a kind of self-portrait, but did not rely on representation of my own body" ...|$|E
