2500|$|Also in 1962, IBM {{introduced}} the model 1311 disk drive, {{which was about}} the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable <b>disk</b> <b>pack.</b> Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of magnetic tape. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called [...] "fixed disk" [...] drives.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{block size}} could be {{specified}} {{up to the}} maximum track length. [...] Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size. [...] Blocks ("records" [...] in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.|$|E
2500|$|Transistorized {{electronics}} improved {{not only}} the CPU (Central Processing Unit), but also the peripheral devices. The second generation disk data storage units were able to store {{tens of millions of}} letters and digits. [...] Next to the fixed disk storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.|$|E

The 2311 models 11 or 12 are used when directly attached to an integrated {{control of the}} System/360 Model 20 and the <b>disk</b> <b>packs</b> are written with a fixed sector format. The <b>disk</b> <b>packs</b> are not interchangeable between those written on the Model 1 and those written on the Models 11 or 12.|$|R

2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Disk</b> <b>pack</b> is a layered {{grouping}} of hard disk platters (circular, rigid discs {{coated with a}} magnetic data storage surface). A <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> is the core component of a hard disk drive. In modern hard disks, the <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> is permanently sealed inside the drive. In many early hard disks, the <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> was a removable unit, and would be supplied with a protective canister featuring a lifting handle.|$|E
50|$|The {{protective}} cover {{consisted of two}} parts, a clear plastic shell, with a handle in the center, that enclosed the top and sides of the disks and a separate bottom that completed the sealed package. To remove the <b>disk</b> <b>pack,</b> the drive would be taken off line and allowed to spin down. Its access door could then be opened and an empty top shell inserted and twisted to unlock the disk platter from the drive and secure {{it to the top}} shell. The assembly would then be lifted out and the bottom cover attached. A different <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> could then be inserted by removing the bottom and placing the <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> with its top shell into the drive. Turning the handle would lock the <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> in place and free the top shell for removal.|$|E
30|$|Poisson disk {{sampling}} is {{an important}} problem in computer graphics and has {{a wide variety of}} applications in imaging, geometry, rendering, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel Poisson disk sampling algorithm based on <b>disk</b> <b>packing.</b> The key idea uses the observation that a relatively dense <b>disk</b> <b>packing</b> layout naturally satisfies the Poisson disk distribution property that each point is no closer to the others than a specified minimum distance, i.e., the Poisson disk radius. We use this property to propose a relaxation algorithm that achieves a good balance between the random and uniform properties needed for Poisson disk distributions. Our algorithm is easily adapted to image stippling by extending identical <b>disk</b> <b>packing</b> to unequal <b>disks.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches.|$|R

5000|$|The IBM 3330 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named Merlin, was {{introduced}} in June 1970 for use with the IBM System/370 and the IBM System 360/195. Its removable <b>disk</b> <b>packs</b> hold 100 MB (404x19x13,030 bytes) (the 1973 Model 11 featured IBM 3336-11 <b>Disk</b> <b>Packs</b> that hold 200 MB (808x19x13,030 bytes)). Access time is 30 ms and data transfers at 806 kB/s. A major advance introduced with the 3330 {{is the use of}} error correction, which makes the drives more reliable and reduced costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated. The circuitry can correct error bursts up to 11 bits long through use of Fire codes.|$|R
40|$|The archival {{database}} of the HELP Hospital Information System at LDS Hospital {{is too large}} to be stored on line. The archival data are important for clinical and research applications. Demountable <b>disk</b> <b>packs</b> {{have been used to}} store the archival database. This method of storage has four significant disadvantages. A virtual database was developed to overcome the limitations of this data-management scheme. This virtual database enables the transparent use of appropriate low-cost network-based storage technology to provide on-line availability of the entire archive of clinical data. The virtual database successfully resolves the problems associated with <b>disk</b> <b>packs,</b> and opens the door to enhanced use of the data for clinical and research applications...|$|R

5000|$|On 9 July 2006, Plusnet lost 700 GB of {{customer}} email data due to human error. During a routine maintenance upgrade to the email system, an engineer mistakenly reformatted a live <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> {{instead of the}} intended backup <b>disk</b> <b>pack.</b> Plusnet provided updates on their investigation but did not reveal the size or {{cause of the problem}} until 10 July 2006 at 15:39. Plusnet explained that the engineer responsible had accessed both the live and backup disk packs from a single workstation. The engineer believed his reconfiguration was to the backup storage when it was actually connected to the live email <b>disk</b> <b>pack.</b> In the following days, Plusnet did recover some email data and explained that other data may have been lost to corruption during the recovery. The official Plusnet UserGroup launched an [...] "Email Stability & Resiliency Campaign" [...] to attempt to ensure Plusnet made suitable investments and put in place measures to prevent future issues.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1973, Control Data Corporation {{introduced}} {{the first of}} its series of SMD disk drives using conventional <b>disk</b> <b>pack</b> technology. The SMD family became the predominant disk drive in the minicomputer market into the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|When clients {{want more}} {{explicit}} {{control over the}} location of files, they can use the [...] "removable pack" [...] concept.

50|$|Others were novel, {{including}} protocols for printer spooling, copying <b>disk</b> <b>packs,</b> page-level {{remote access}} to file servers, name lookup, remote management, etc. (although some of these capabilities had been seen before, e.g. the ARPANET already made heavy use of remote management for controlling the Interface Message Processors which made it up).|$|R
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase.

Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|R
