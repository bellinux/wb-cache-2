40|$|Abstract. When {{the liquid}} {{residing}} in a horizontal bed of porous material is displaced by another liquid of different density, the resulting hydrodynamic dispersion is modified by {{the formation of}} a tongue of denser liquid undershooting the less dense liquid, a phenomenon known as <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation.</b> An earlier account of <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> contained a substantial error (that of an incorrect frame of reference for flow) and several printing mistakes. In this paper we (i) correct these errors, (ii) extend the analysis to describe the course of breakthrough in beds of rectangular and circular cross-sections, (iii) re-interpret the existing experimental evidence, and (iv) present new experimental results on the vertical and horizontal transport of ionic solutions of different concentrations and densities through inert and reactive porous materials, ballotini, and sepiolite, respectively. The behaviour of immiscible liquids is predicted by the non-dimensional <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> number, β, segregation becoming more extreme as β increases. With miscible liquids, however, breakthrough starts later and ends earlier then predicted for immiscible liquids, mixing by hydrodynamic dispersion moderating the effect of segregation. Breakthrough curves are well fitted by CXTFIT 2. 0; apparent coefficients of hydrodynamic dispersion vary much less with pore-water velocity in horizontal than in vertical flow, but retardation factors are not influenced by orientation.

The method used for the simulation of a gravity field will be based on the settling procedure. Gravity induced settling will be separated into two stages - Free Settling and Skeletal Settling. Isolated solid phase domains fall under gravity and slide down over the already settled domains (free settling). During settling they make point contacts with each other.

40|$|Multiphase and non-Darcy flow {{effects in}} {{hydraulically}} fractured gas wells reduce effective fracture conductivity. Typical proppant pack laboratory experiments are oriented {{in such a}} way such that phase segregation is not possible, which results in mixed flow. Tidwell and Parker (1996), however, showed that in proppant packs, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs for simultaneous gas and liquid injection at laboratory scale (1500 cm 2). Although the impact of gravity on flow in natural fractures has been described, previous work has not fully described the effect of gravity on multiphase non-Darcy flow in hydraulic fractures. In this work, reservoir simulation modeling was used to determine the extent and impact of <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> in a hydraulic fracture at field scale. I found that by ignoring segregation, effective fracture conductivity can be underestimated by up to a factor of two. An analytical solution was developed for uniform flux of water and gas into the fracture. The solution for pressures and saturations in the fracture agrees well with reservoir simulation. <b>Gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs in moderate-to-high conductivity fractures. <b>Gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> impacts effective fracture conductivity when gas and liquid are being produced at all water-gas ratios modeled above 2 Bbls per MMscf. More realistic, non-uniform-flux models were also run with the hydraulic fracture connected to a gas reservoir producing water. For constant-gas-rate production, differences in pressure drop between segregated cases and mixed flow cases range up to a factor of two. As the pressure gradient in the fracture increases above 1 to 2 psi/ft, the amount of segregation decreases. Segregation is also less for fracture half-length-to-height ratios less than or close to two. When there is less segregation, the difference in effective conductivity between the segregated and mixed flow cases is reduced. I also modeled the water injection and cleanup phases for a typical slickwater fracture treatment both with and without gravity effects and found that for cases with segregation, effective fracture conductivity is significantly higher than the conductivity when mixed flow occurs. <b>Gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> is commonly ignored in design and analysis of hydraulically fractured gas wells.

40|$|The {{various types}} of {{macrosegregation}} are described and their commercial importance discussed. Previous work on macrosegregation {{reported in the literature}} is reviewed and those theories currently most popular for explaining the various segregates are summarised. A number of commercial castings and ingots were examined. The majority were found to contain macrosegregation although its magnitude seldom exceeded Â±  10 % of the nominal composition. It was felt that contraction fluid flow had been the dominant segregation mechanism in operation, which was in line with the short freezing times of all the castings studied. The critical solidification time required for the gravitational interdendritic fluid flow (GIFF) mechanism to produce significant amounts of segregation was determined. An alloy of Al- 5 &frac 12;wt%Cu was cast into a series of sand moulds of different volumes, and the macrosegregation present in the solidified ingots was related to the various observed freezing times. A total freezing time of approximately 15  mins. had to be exceeded before <b>gravity</b> flow <b>segregation</b> became appreciable. A detailed review is given of previous work concerning {{the nature and extent of}} 'GIFF', particularly with respect to position in the semi-solid zone. Inconsistencies between conclusions are highlighted and explained in terms of differences in presentation of results. It is shown that all previous work indicates that 'GIFF' is important in producing macrosegregation at high liquid volume fractions (g L > 0. 80) in the mushy zone, but that none of the work by design could indicate whether flow at lower g L was important. An experiment was therefore set up to study the amount of segregation produced by 'GIFF' at various g L in the mushy zone. A quenching technique was used. Thin section, 'slice castings' of Sn- 5 wt%Pb were grown undirectionally horizontally for various lengths of time under identical conditions and then quenched. The progress of segregation at given reproducible positions in these castings was determined and related to the progress of the semi-solid zone across the length of the castings. It was shown that although a large part of the final macrosegregation was produced in the region just behind the dendrite tips (1 > g L > 0. 8) a significant amount of segregation was produced by 'GIFF' up to approximately g L = 0. 30. A detailed description of the apparatus and experimental procedure employed is given together with a summary of the experiments conducted to ensure truly reproducible growth conditions between castings. A radioactive tracer technique was used to provide direct visual evidence of fluid flow occurring deep within the semi-solid region of a casting. Radioactive material was inserted into the bulk liquid region of a solidifying 'slice casting' and the subsequent penetration of activity into the original mushy zone was studied. It was estimated from autoradiographs that 'GIFF' was still occurring up to at least g L = 0. 40, thus confirming the results of the 'slice casting' experiments. A ternary Sn-Zn-Pb alloy with zero density change down its liquidus line was developed. This was a Sn-base alloy with a Zn:Pb ratio of 19. 97 : 1 (atomic %) and a total solute content of < 15. 2 at. %. The alloy was developed using a combination of a theoretical treatment and a highly accurate density measurement technique (pycnometer). It was confirmed using the 'slice casting' apparatus that such an alloy had no susceptibility to 'GIFF' segregation. Finally, the analysis technique employed for composition measurements is described, and the operating conditions required for optimum analytical accuracy are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|WAG (Water-Alternating-Gas injection) is a non-thermal EOR process, {{which was}} {{proposed}} to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency and consequently the oil recovery during a gas injection project. Though miscible gas injection gives fantastic displacement efficiency due to its miscibility with oil, it usually shows very poor volumetric sweep efficiency due to the high mobility of gas phase. Alternate injection of gas and water significantly reduces the gas relative mobility, and therefore leads to less gas fingering and/ or tonguing of gas. Aside from fingering and channeling, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> is another major effect {{that leads to the}} deterioration of sweep efficiency in gas-injection EOR processes. After the injected gas and water travels a certain distance in the reservoir, they completely segregate from each other under gravitational forces. Gas goes to the top of reservoir forming an override zone, and water goes to the bottom forming an under-ride zone. In Chapter one, fractional-flow theory is applied to provide insight into the advantages of HWAG. The fractional-flow method describes the flooding process in 1 -D homogeneous reservoirs, which can be applied {{to a wide range of}} EOR processes.

30|$|WAG and SWAG are {{affected}} by the same factors, that is: hysteresis effects, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation,</b> miscibility, gas breakthrough, water and gas slug size, injectivity, reservoir heterogeneities, and miscibility conditions. However, SWAG has been implemented in heavier gravity oils, because of the better mobility control during simultaneous injection with water. During injection of gas in alternation with water (WAG), the challenge of early gas breakthrough is not eliminated especially during the half cycle of gas injection. During WAG, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> plays a great role in oil recovery and therefore very good vertical communication of the reservoir is desirable. On the contrary, owing to the method of injection, SWAG may be implemented in reservoirs with poor vertical permeability, especially when the gas and water are injected using two separate horizontal wells. In most cases, SWAG is carried out in reservoirs with very thin pay zones, as seen in Table  4, to allow for formation of mixed flow zones of gas and water in the larger part of the reservoir. WAG may be carried out in thicker formations to allow for gas trapping.|$|E
30|$|Table  4 also {{summarizes}} CO 2 storage (Fig.  16) and <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> lengths {{for those}} two separate injections.

We do achieve the same R g for SINB and SIWB as well as the higher injection pressure for the latter (Rossen et al. 2006; Rossen and Shen 2007; Jamshidnezhad et al. 2008 b). However, the sweep efficiency improvement was not remarkable, particularly for the novel foam. Relative to water and gas injection through the same intervals (SIAP and SIPP), the distance to the point of complete segregation R g increases by a factor of about 1.5 and higher injectivity (Figs.  20, 23) has been achieved for separate injection (SINB and SIWB). This result agrees with the theoretical prediction of R g as a function of water fractional flow reported in the literature (Rossen et al. 2006; Rossen and Shen 2007). From above analysis we can find, for novel foam, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> length is a less precise representative parameter of sweep efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Part I In {{this part}} of the thesis, two {{different}} methodologies for solving the inverse problem of mapping the subsurface electric conductivity distribution using controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data are presented. The two inversion methodologies are based on a classical and a Bayesian approach for solving inverse problems, respectively. In the classical approach, we regularize the inverse problem by incorporating structural prior information available from, e. g., interpreted seismic data. In many cases, the outcome of an interpretation of seismic data cannot be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. Hence, to incorporate non-Gaussian prior information we have applied the shape prior technique. Here, an implicit transformation of variables facilitates the incorporation of non-Gaussian prior information, at the expense of an applicationdependent kernel function. In the Bayesian approach, a combination of prior knowledge and observed data results in a solution given as a posterior probability density function (PDF). To sample from the posterior PDF, a sequential Bayesian method, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), is applied. Structural prior information is naturally incorporated {{as a part of the}} Bayesian framework. To represent large-scale subsurface structures two model-based, composite parameterizations based on the level-set representation are applied in the inversion methodologies. By using a reduced number of parameters in the representation, a regularization of the inverse problem is achieved. Moreover, it enables the use of second-order gradientbased optimization algorithms in the classical approach. Part II In {{this part of}} the thesis, a numerical investigation of the upstream mobility scheme for calculating fluid flow in porous media is presented. Previous studies have shown that the upstream mobility scheme experienced erroneous behaviour when approximating pure <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> flow in 1 D heterogeneous porous media.

40|$|The {{solidification}} {{behavior of}} gold-silicon alloys containing up to 25 at. % silicon was studied, and {{a mathematical model}} of <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> during solidification was developed. A background of knowledge is provided {{which can be used}} in the design of zero gravity solidification experiments to be carried out in the 300 -ft drop tower, in Aerobee rockets and in future space missions. Such experiments are needed to develop the basic scientific knowledge required for the design of economically viable space manufacturing processes. Some preliminary zero gravity experiments were carried out on a gold- 25 at. % silicon alloy using the drop tower facility...|$|E
40|$|Gelama Merah {{field is}} located in {{offshore}} west Sabah, Malaysia. Gas Assisted Gravity Drainage (GAGD) was proposed to overcome the <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> effect from continuous gas injection in the conventional horizontal flooding patterns as well as water shielding, decreased in oil relative permeability and reduced in gas injectivity which happened in Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) process. This research was done based on heterogeneous reservoir, which {{has not yet been}} attempted by any published GAGD research. The objectives of the research are to investigate the effect of kv/kh on <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> in the visual physical model; to study the effect of operating parameters on the oil recovery (RF) and breakthrough time; to visualize and understand the development of the downward movement towards the horizontal producer; to study the relationship of kv/kh to oil recovery and breakthrough time at their respective gravity number (NG); to scale up the production time to real reservoir condition; to compare the simulation results with laboratory results. Investigations have been done by using Schlumberger ECLIPSE 100 which have been prior history-matched with laboratory results. Results show that for heterogeneous reservoir, kv/kh of 0. 8 show the highest RF (64. 73 %ROIP). Since the gas density did not show a significant change in RF, it was suggested that compress gas might can be apply for GAGD process.

30|$|Then, {{co-injection}} is examined, either {{two phases}} {{in the same}} intervals (simultaneous injection through all perforation, SIAP, or simultaneous injection through partial perforation, SIPP), or water into the upper part while gas into the lower part (separate injection no barrier, SINB, or separate injection with barrier, SIWB). Stone (2004 a, b) proposed injection of water in an interval above the gas to increase reservoir sweep, which is called “modified SWAG” by Algharaib et al. (2007). The main goal of separate injection {{is to reduce the}} effect of <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation</b> commonly encountered in gas–liquid flow in reservoirs with high vertical communication (Rossen et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|The above {{concern has}} led to the {{development}} of the water-alternating-gas (WAG) process for flood profile control. The higher microscopic displacement efficiency of gas combined with the better macroscopic sweep efficiency of water has been found to significantly increase the incremental oil production over the plain waterflood. The WAG process was first proposed by Caudle and Dyes 1958 and has remained the industry default mobility control method for gas injection, mainly due to the lack of proven flood profile control alternatives. Reservoir key parameters such as wettability, interfacial tension, connate water saturation, <b>gravity</b> <b>segregation,</b> and the reservoir heterrogeneity could add complexity to the design of a successful WAG flood.|$|E
