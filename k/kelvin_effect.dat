50|$|Cloud {{physics is}} the study of the {{physical}} processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of atmospheric clouds. These aerosols are found in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, which collectively make up the greatest part of the homosphere. Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice (cold clouds), or both (mixed phase clouds). Cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a critical value according to Köhler theory. Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary for cloud droplets formation because of the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect,</b> which describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface. At small radii, the amount of supersaturation needed for condensation to occur is so large, that it does not happen naturally. Raoult's Law describes how the vapor pressure is dependent on the amount of solute in a solution. At high concentrations, when the cloud droplets are small, the supersaturation required is smaller than without the presence of a nucleus.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{smoothing}} surfaces with nanoscale roughness is described, {{based on the}} <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect.</b> The problem of vapor redistribution in cylindrical channels and over rough planar walls with nanoscale texture is posed and solved analytically. Vapor deposition (condensation) on the walls initially produces a deposit emulating the surface landscape. After a saturated state at the deposit surface is reached, the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect</b> should result in higher vapor pressure/ concentration near the convex sections of the wall and in lower vapor pressure/ concentration near the concave sections. As a result, local vapor fluxes should arise directed from the locally convex to the locally concave regions. Accordingly, the deposited layer at the wall should vaporize (or sublimate) at the convex sections due to depletion and vapor should condense at the concave sections, thus causing smoothing of physical surface unevenness. This mechanism of smoothing of nanoscale roughness has not been considered in detail or used before, even though the basic physics of the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect</b> is well known. In the present work, the smoothing kinetics is predicted and the characteristic timescales are calculated in the general case of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations of the cylindrical channel walls, {{as well as for}} planar surfaces.

40|$|The {{response}} of the water column to varying conditions of stratification and wind forcing was investigated in Lake Kinneret (Israel) using data collected from thermistor chains and acoustic Doppler current profilers during 1997 and 1998. The strong daily sea breeze was found to generate a vertical mode 1 internal Kelvin wave and basin-scale internal Poincare ́ waves of vertical modes 1, 2, and 3. The Kelvin wave, the dominant component of the internal wave field, was responsible for alongshore velocities in the nearshore regions. In the upwind nearshore regions, velocities were dominated by the forced response to the wind and were cross-shore in nature. In the lake interior, the <b>Kelvin</b> wave <b>effect</b> on the horizontal velocity field was minor compared to the higher vertical mode Poincare ́ waves. The Kelvin wave is shown to exist in resonant and nonforced states with the wind, whereas the vertical mode 1 Poincare ́ wave energy remained relatively constant, despite large variability in the forcing condi-tions. The energy in the higher mode Poincare ́ waves varied greatly, both on daily and seasonal timescales.

The E-W feedback in the presence of mean easterlies leads to unstable Kelvin modes. The presence of mean westerlies leads to decaying Kelvin modes. When CISK and the E-W feedback work in concert, an unstable Kelvin mode develops that has phase speeds of propagation between 5 m/s and 10 m/s for a large range of parameter values.

Following a government decree to restrict large ship {{access to the}} Port of Venice through the Lido and Giudecca channels, the Port authority has been investigating {{the construction of a}} new channel between Marghera and the cruise terminal, to re-route all large vessels through the Malamocco lagoon entrance. Ships in the Venice Lagoon travel at low speeds with associated low depth-based Froude numbers (< 0. 5), and classical <b>Kelvin</b> wave <b>effects</b> are minimal. However, under certain channel geometries, depression waves (also known as Bernoulli wake) can be substantial with significant far-field effects.

By contrast, depression waves associated with large ships in the Lido and Giudecca channels are much smaller (~ 0. 3 – 0. 4 m). Rerouting large cruise ships entering the Port of Venice through the Malamocco–Marghera channel and a newly constructed channel will have adverse effects on the Venice lagoon with increased water velocities and sediment resuspension associated with the nonlinear Riemann waves.

When the magnetizations in the two F layers are not collinear, singlet pairs are drained from the S layer, and triplet generation is signaled by a decrease of the critical temperature T_{c}.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{growth of}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) into cloud droplets under supersaturated water vapour conditions {{is described by}} classic Köhler theory. This spontaneous activation of CCN depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect,</b> whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension, which is sensitive to surfactants. Surface tension lowering caused by organic surfactants, which diminishes the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect,</b> {{is expected to be}} negated by a concomitant reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the droplet bulk to the droplet–vapour interface. Here we present observational and theoretical evidence illustrating that, in ambient air, surface tension lowering can prevail over the reduction in the Raoult effect, leading to substantial increases in cloud droplet concentrations. We suggest that consideration of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to complete or partial engulfing of a hygroscopic particle core by a hydrophobic organic-rich phase, can explain the lack of concomitant reduction of the Raoult effect, while maintaining substantial lowering of surface tension, even for partial surface coverage. Apart from the importance of particle size and composition in droplet activation, we show by observation and modelling that incorporation of phase-separation effects into activation thermodynamics can lead to a CCN number concentration that is up to ten times what is predicted by climate models, changing the properties of clouds. An adequate representation of the CCN activation process is essential to the prediction of clouds in climate models, and given the effect of clouds on the Earth’s energy balance, improved prediction of aerosol–cloud–climate interactions is likely to result in improved assessments of future climate change...|$|E

Although recent studies 11, 12, 13 predict that low-volatility organic vapours contribute during initial growth, direct evidence has been lacking. The accelerating growth may result from increased photolytic production of condensable organic species in the afternoon 2, and the presence of a possible <b>Kelvin</b> (curvature) <b>effect,</b> which inhibits organic vapour condensation on the smallest particles (the nano-Köhler theory) 2, 14, has so far remained ambiguous.

Using data from the same set of experiments, it has been shown 15 that organic vapours alone can drive nucleation. We focus on the growth of nucleated particles and find that the organic vapours that drive initial growth have extremely low volatilities (saturation concentration less than 10 − 4. 5 micrograms per cubic metre). As the particles increase in size and the Kelvin barrier falls, subsequent growth is primarily due to more abundant organic vapours of slightly higher volatility (saturation concentrations of 10 − 4. 5 to 10 − 0. 5 micrograms per cubic metre).

We then study the motion of a variety of vortex-current filaments, including helical, planar, and self-similar filament structures. In the case where MHD effects are weak relative to hydrodynamic effects, the filaments behave as expected from the pure hydrodynamic theory. However, when MHD effects are strong enough to dominate, then we observe structural changes to the filaments in all cases considered.

The model particle consisted of a water droplet coated with fatty acid. The density profile (using both Coarse-Grained and Atomistic/United atom models) demonstrated that such aerosol particles have an inverted micelle structure consisting of an aqueous core and with the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails exposed to the atmosphere. For smaller chains, with the organic molecules directed radially outwards from the water - organic interface) the normal pressure profile showed that the organic coating is under tension resulting in a 'negative' surface tension. As a result, such particles would have an inverse <b>Kelvin</b> vapor pressure <b>effect</b> and would be able to process water vapor despite the hydrophobic surface. Following the work on surface tension, the rate of water uptake by coated aerosols was computed. It was found that the sticking coefficient of water vapor on such particles was about a sixth of that on pure water droplets. This may seem to imply that the net condensation rate is lower, but we also need to take into account the evaporation of water from such particles. With a significant reduction in the evaporation rate (the coating lends greater stability to the particle resulting in reduced evaporation rate), the equilibrium vapor pressure of water on such particles reduced, resulting in a "net water attractor". Thus if such structures were created in sufficient concentration, they might be important contributors in the cloud condensation process. Next the effect of longer Fatty acid molecules and branched surfactants on the structure and properties of coated particles was studied. It was found that in either case, due to stronger organic - organic interactions, the surfactant molecules tend to align themselves parallel to each other forcing local flattening of the underlying water substrate and consequently such particles behaved in a manner consistent with an "oily" drop, in sharp contrast to the case of shorter chains, where the particle was a "net water attractor". Finally, the effect of organic coating on the Stokes drag of functionalized nanoparticles was studied. This work was motivated by a recent experimental study in which the thickness of Self Assembled Monolayers on Gold nanoparticles was characterized using a measurement process that relies on the determination of the size of a charged particle through knowledge of the drag force. The thickness of the coating was found to ~ 35 % less than that predicted by a rigid core-shell model. This suggests that the functionalized Au-NP would have an inverted micelle structure. The MD simulations showed that the drag on the coated particle was indeed less than that on the corresponding pure particle, consistent with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} how lattice-gas cellular automata {{may be used}} to simulate evaporation phenomena in models of porous media constructed at the pore scale. Two-dimensional simulations of evaporation are performed in simple channel geometries and in a model of a microscopically disordered porous medium. We describe a variant of the lattice pas, called the liquid-gas model. By static and dynamic tests we show that this model can simulate low Reynolds number mechanical and thermodynamical equations for isothermal evaporation in a real system made of a single-species liquid in equilibrium with its vapor. From static simulations in simple geometries we obtain equilibrium pressures on both sides of meniscus. These are seen to obey the Gibbs-Thomson relations, which are equivalent to the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect.</b> We observe evaporation in simple capillary channels and compare the results to a simple theory based on Poiseuille flow. An unexpected effect is additional flow in the wetting films and sharp density jumps. In simulations of evaporation in disordered geometries, we observe bursting and convoluted interaces as previously reported in laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} that freshly nucleated nanoparticles can survive to become cloud condensation nuclei is highly sensitive to particle growth rates. Much {{of the growth}} of newly formed ambient nanoparticles can be attributed to oxidized organic vapors originating from biogenic precursor gases. In this study we investigated the chemical composition of size-selected biogenic nanoparticles in the size range from 10 to 40 nm. Particles were formed in a flow tube reactor by ozonolysis ofα-pinene and analyzed with a Thermal Desorption Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer. While we found similar composition in 10 and 20 nm particles, the relative amounts of individual species varied significantly when compared to 40 nm particles. Smaller particles (10 and 20 nm) were characterized by enhancements in carboxylic acids and larger particles (40 nm) showed higher concentrations of carbonyl-containing compounds and low molecular weight organic acids. This composition change from smaller to larger size particles reflects a vapor pressure increase of the condensing vapors by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude indicating that the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect</b> plays a decisive role in the growth of biogenic nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a possibility to regularize the hydrodynamic contact line singularity in {{the configuration of}} partial wetting (liquid wedge on a solid substrate) via evaporation-condensation, when an inert gas {{is present in the}} atmosphere above the liquid. The no-slip condition is imposed at the solid-liquid interface and the system is assumed to be isothermal. The mass exchange dynamics is controlled by vapor diffusion in the inert gas and interfacial kinetic resistance. The coupling between the liquid meniscus curvature and mass exchange is provided by the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect.</b> The atmosphere is saturated and the substrate moves at a steady velocity with respect to the liquid wedge. A multi-scale analysis is performed. The liquid dynamics description in the phase-change-controlled microregion and visco-capillary intermediate region is based on the lubrication equations. The vapor diffusion is considered in the gas phase. It is shown that from the mathematical point of view, the phase exchange relieves the contact line singularity. The liquid mass is conserved: evaporation existing on a part of the meniscus and condensation occurring over another part compensate exactly each other. However, numerical estimations carried out for three common fluids (ethanol, water and glycerol) at the ambient conditions show that the characteristic length scales are tiny...|$|E
40|$|Polaritons are half-matter half-light quasiparticles, arising, in a {{two-dimensional}} semiconductor microcavity, from the strong-coupling between an exciton (an elementary electronic excitation of a crystal) and a photon. This thesis presents the fabrication of polariton confining structures, their characterization {{and the study}} of the linear and non-linear optical properties of the confined polaritons. Thanks to their bosonic character, to their extremely light effective mass and to the peculiar shape of their dispersion curve, polaritons were proven to accumulate in their ground state to form a Bose-Einstein condensate in a CdTe based sample, at a high temperature of the order of 20 <b>Kelvin.</b> No such <b>effect</b> was observed in GaAs materials, who offer a less disordered environment, where we developed a method to fabricate traps of any shape and size. The latter should facilitate the condensation of polaritons by lowering the density thresholds, and allow us to manipulate the condensate. Thanks to the strong-coupling regime, it is possible to confine polaritons either through their photon or through their exciton part. We thus fabricated two-dimensional microcavities with local thickness variations, confining the cavity photon along its two free dimensions. We were able to perform this through high-quality molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth, accompanied by a controlled processing of the sample. We measured the anticrossing behaviors characteristic of the strong-coupling regime in zero and two dimensions. As the confining structures have sizes of the order of the micron, we could image the confined polaritons' wave functions in the real and reciprocal (momentum) spaces, and tried to understand how the transition between confined (0 D) and extended (2 D) polariton modes occurs. We also gave first evidences of the interaction between the two and zero-dimensional structures, and of the polariton trapping from one to the other. We then studied the nonlinear optical properties of this new object, performing two different kinds of experiments: a study of the response of the system to a non-resonant excitation, in order to probe the formation of a condensed phase. Collective electronic excitations were created, at energies far higher than the modes which are of interest for us. We observed the effect of high densities in the system and evidenced Coulomb interaction. We then observed the cross-over from strong to weak-coupling regime, and the onset of lasing in the weakly coupled system. a study of the response of the system to a resonant excitation in order to probe parametric effects between the discrete states. In this configuration a number of polaritons are intentionally created in a given state. We observed various nonlinear behaviors {{as a function of the}} created population, which may be interpreted as effects of Coulomb interaction, or indications of bistable behaviors in the system. We were nevertheless not able to discriminate. We give some potential applications in the field of single or correlated photon emission. Although industrial applications may not be in the short-term agenda, it should be possible to take advantages of this original type of structures for research and development applications. We finally give some experimental perspectives, which may help deepen the observations shown and the interpretations proposed here, and should allow to work towards the fabrication of new samples, where BEC of polaritons is observed and controlled, as well as parametric oscillations between various confined states...|$|R
40|$|Ferro- and antiferromagnetic {{molecular}} crystals are {{in several}} ways quite distinct from the conventional metallic alloys or oxidic crystals studied in solid state physics. The exchange coupling constants are usually very small for crystals of free radical molecules. Some molecular crystals show a typical magnetic behavior at a very low temperature range and another kind of behavior at a higher temperature. This feature cannot be quantitatively explained by using the conventional Ising model of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. In this work we show that a magnon-based approach is capable of explaining the observed AFM [...] > FM and FM [...] > AFM transitions in crystals of free radical molecules in a natural manner. A three-dimensional lattice is, in general, anisotropic in magnetic properties. For instance, in a molecular crystal, FM interactions may be observed along a particular direction while AFM interactions dominate along the others. Also, the coupling constants can vary widely along the three crystal axes. We have classified ferro- and antiferromagnetic molecular crystals into four distinct types, viz., FFF, AFF, AAF, and AAA, for orthorhombic or higher crystal symmetries. The anisotropic Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian operators for these four systems have been {{expressed in terms of}} magnon variables. The magnon dispersion relations have been determined, and by using these relationships the magnon population has been calculated for the low temperature range {{as well as for the}} medium and high temperature ranges. These calculations rely on the choice of the population distribution function. The low temperature calculation involves the Planck distribution. Since the magnon-magnon interaction increases very rapidly above the Neel temperature, we have made use of the classical limit, that is, a Boltzmann distribution for each spin site, and the zeroth-order one-magnon energy to calculate the magnon population at higher temperature ranges. All these calculations are based on the consideration of a macroscopically large crystal of a specific shape, and the validity of the results rests on the assumption that the bulk magnetic properties remain unchanged for a macroscopically large crystal of any other shape. Then we have derived expressions for the overall magnetization in macroscopically large crystals of the four types in the two temperature ranges, and the corresponding magnetic susceptibilities (chi). In doing so, we have made use of a typical Weiss molecular field in each case. The resulting expressions are general enough, that is, they are for an anisotropic crystal and remain valid in wide ranges of temperature. They also agree with available experimental data. The FFF and the AAA systems do not exhibit any unusual trend. As T [...] > 0, the FFF system attains saturation whereas the AFF, AAF, and AAA systems all show an approximate T- 2 dependence of chi(parallel to). At a sufficiently high temperature, all four types exhibit bulk paramagnetism that follow the Curie-Weiss-type law. The FFF susceptibility develops a characteristic (T-T-C) (- 1) dependence on temperature whereas the antiferromagnetic systems have susceptibilities proportional to (T+T-N) (- 1) where T-C and T-N are the Curie-Weiss point and the Neel temperatures, respectively. Expressions derived in this work can easily explain an AFM [...] > FM transition occurring in the AFF and AAF molecular crystals at a very low temperature. The low temperature antiferromagnetic susceptibility is singular at a temperature T- 0 that is sufficiently small and usually varies within 0 - 5 K. The low temperature expression holds up to a fraction of a degree below T- 0. The singularity indicates that the high temperature expression becomes valid at a temperature slightly above T- 0. The high temperature susceptibility is basically ferromagnetic in nature, thereby explaining the AFM [...] > FM transition that should occur at a temperature around the singular point. At least one AAF substance, phenyl-substituted triphenyl verdazyl, shows a FM [...] > AFM transition at about 100 K. This phenomenon, which has not been explained heretofore, can be accounted for if we include the possibility of a temperature-dependent ferromagnetic Weiss constant of the form gamma(T) =gamma(0) exp[-T/T*]. The critical temperature T* is usually very large so that gamma normally appears to be independent of temperature, but it can be of the order of one hundred degrees <b>Kelvin</b> when stereo-electronic <b>effects</b> cause a lateral displacement in the stacking of the free radical monomers along the FM direction. A concise account of the limitation of the theory has been given in the form of concluding remarks. (C) 1999 [S 0021 - 9606 (99) 01542 - 1]...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{small-scale}} structure of a contact line formed by a pure liquid, a gas (in particular, the vapor of the liquid considered), and a smooth and chemically homogeneous solid substrate. On {{the basis of the}} lubrication approximation (small slopes of the liquid/gas interface), various situations are considered, including volatile or nonvolatile liquid, partial or complete wetting, and advancing or receding contact lines. Two types of microfilms ahead of the contact line are considered: extended (i. e. covering the substrate everywhere) and truncated (i. e. formally ending at some “dry” spot). On the macroscopic side, results useful for the study of many configurations, such as droplet evaporation and boiling, are provided in terms of the Cox Voinov relationship, relating the scale-dependent apparent contact angle to the velocity of the contact line. Parameters entering this relationship—namely, the apparent contact angle of the steady microstructure and the microlength below which singularities of the contact line are regularized—are calculated in various cases. Particular attention is devoted to discussing the pertinence of disjoining pressure and the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>effect</b> (curvature dependence of saturation conditions) at small scales in relation with the resolution of contact line singularities. The selection between microstructures with extended and truncated films is also discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
