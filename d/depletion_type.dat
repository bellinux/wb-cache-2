40|$|Abstract. We present {{observations}} from the Polar satel-lite that confirm {{the existence of}} two types of depletion lay-ers predicted under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions in magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The first <b>depletion</b> <b>type</b> occurs along the stagnation line when IMF BX and/or dipole tilt are/is present. Magnetic merg-ing occurred away from the equator (Maynard et al., 2003) and flux pile-ups developed while the field lines drape to the high-latitude merging sites. This high-shear type of deple-tion {{is consistent with the}} depletion layer model suggested by Zwan and Wolf (1976) for low-shear northward IMF con-ditions.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{realization}} of electrical coupling between neurons and <b>depletion</b> <b>type</b> floating gate (FG) p-channel MOS transistors. The devices were realized in a shortened 0. 5 mum CMOS technology. Increased boron implant dose was used to form the <b>depletion</b> <b>type</b> devices. Post-CMOS processing steps were added to expose the devices sensing area. The neurons are coupled to the polycrystalline silicon (PS) FG through 420 A thermal oxide in an area which is located over the thick field oxide away from the transistor. The combination of coupling area pad having a diameter of 10 or 15 mum and sensing transistor with W/L of 50 / 0. 5 mum results in capacitive coupling ratio of the neuron signal of about 0. 5 together with relatively large transistor transconductance. The combination of the FG structure with a <b>depletion</b> <b>type</b> device, leads to the following advantages. (a) No need for dc bias between the solution in which the neurons are cultured and the transistor with expected consequences to the neuron {{as well as the}} silicon die durability. (b) The sensing area of the neuron activity is separated from the active area of the transistor. Thus, it is possible to design the sensing area and the channel area separately. (c) The channel area, which is the most sensitive part of the transistor, can be insulated and shielded from the ionic solution in which the neurons are cultured. (d) There is an option to add a switching transistor to the FG and use the FG also for the neuron stimulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

In 69 of 73 cases of Hodgkin's disease (41 nodular sclerosis, 25 mixed cellularity, 4 lymphocyte predominance, and 3 lymphocyte <b>depletion</b> <b>types),</b> R-S cells were strongly immunoreactive for Leu-M 1. Four cases of lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease (nodular) were uniformly nonreactive for Leu-M 1. In {{most of the}} positive cases (57 / 69, 83 %), the majority (60 - 90 %) of R-S cells and variants exhibited immunoreactivity for Leu-M 1. A characteristic staining pattern included granular and/or vesicular cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, often with a prominent globular paranuclear reaction product, and membrane staining with highly irregular cytoplasmic borders. Evaluation of B-cell (37 specimens), T-cell (20 specimens), and true histiocytic (3 specimens) neoplasms and a case of mastocytosis revealed immunoreactivity for Leu-M 1 only in 1 B-cell and 4 T-cell malignancies. The staining patterns in these cases, however, clearly differed from that observed for R-S cells. Studies of nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues (38 total) demonstrated that lymphoid cells were typically nonreactive; histiocytes revealed variable reactivity for Leu-M 1. Occasional histiocytes of the sinusoidal network of lymph nodes, particularly in toxoplasmic lymphadenitis, exhibited a staining pattern (membranous/cytoplasmic/paranuclear) similar to that observed for R-S cells.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{variable}} and constant-intensity cycling on muscle glycogen depletion patterns and subsequent running economy was examined. 60 minutes of cycling at a constant power (CON) or variable intensity (VAR) followed by a treadmill run to determine running economy was completed by nine male triathletes (Vo 2 max = 67. 7 (4. 9 ml) kg− min− 1). During CON, there was greater glycogen <b>depletion</b> in the <b>type</b> I fibres compared with type II (0. 08 (0. 04) vs 0. 02 (0. 01) optical density (OD) units; p< 0. 05), while during VAR, there was greater glycogen <b>depletion</b> in the <b>type</b> II fibres compared with type I (0. 06 (0. 03) vs 0. 03 (0. 02) OD; p< 0. 05). The variation in muscle glycogen depletion patterns {{was not associated with}} the detriment in running economy, which was not significantly different between conditions (52. 1 vs 52. 8 ml kg− 1 min− 1). There was a strong correlation between total muscle glycogen depletion and the change in running Vo 2 (r = 0. 73, p< 0. 05) when the data from both trials were combined. There was also a negative correlation between type I fibre percentage and glycogen <b>depletion</b> within <b>type</b> II fibres during CON (r = − 0. 85, p< 0. 05). The results demonstrate that the decrease in running economy, subsequent to 60 minutes of cycling, is not affected by the cycling strategy employed. While different glycogen depletion patterns in the type I and II fibres were observed between conditions, total glycogen depletion may be more important to subsequent running economy. The percentage of type I fibres was associated with the glycogen depletion pattern during constant load, but not variable-intensity exercise. ...|$|R

In 55 of 63 cases (87 %) of these combined types, less than 5 % of Reed-Sternberg cells or variants were L 26 positive. In the remaining cases, {{a larger proportion of}} these cells expressed L 26. Topographic patterns of immunoreactivity for small lymphocytes in these different types of Hodgkin's disease also varied.

In other types of Hodgkin's disease, L 26 positive cells occurred in small or large aggregates and generally represented a minor proportion of the population of lymphoid cells. These studies further support a B cell derivation for L & H variants of Reed-Sternberg cells and provide additional evidence that nodular lymphocyte predominance type Hodgkin's disease may represent a distinct entity, possibly an unusual low grade B cell lymphoma. These data also suggest that some Reed-Sternberg cells and variants present in other histologic types of Hodgkin's disease may be of B cell derivation, and precludes the use of L 26 as a diagnostic discriminant in cases in which the distinction between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is unclear...|$|R

With an indium content of 80 % in the channel a 2 x 30 µm MHEMT device has shown a transit frequency (ft) of 290 GHz, an extrinsic transconductance of 1450 mS/mm and a maximum stable gain (MSG) of 11 dB at 94 GHz. Using two HEMTs connected in cascode configuration the MSG could be increased to 22 dB. To stabilize the cascode device and to increase the bandwidth of the amplifier circuit a resistive feedback was integrated into the HEMT in common-gate configuration. Coplanar topology in combination with cascode transistors resulted in a chip-size of only 1 x 1 mm 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Escherichia coli signal {{transduction}} protein PII, {{product of the}} glnB gene, was overproduced and purified. The predicted molecular weight of the protein based on the correct nucleotide sequence is 12, 427 and {{is very close to}} the value 12, 435 obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Hexagonal crystals of the unuridylylated form of PII with dimensions 0. 2 × 0. 2 × 0. 3 mm were grown and analysed by X-ray diffraction. The crystals belong to space group P 63 with a=b= 61. 6 Å,c= 56. 3 Å and Vm of 2. 5 for one subunit in the asymmetric unit. A low-resolution electron density map showed electron density concentrated around a three-fold axis, suggesting the molecule to be a trimer. A sedimentation equilibrium experiment of the meniscus <b>depletion</b> <b>type</b> was used to estimate a molecular weight of 35, 000 ± 1, 000 for PII in solution. This result is consistent with the native protein being a homotrimer...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{approaches}} to receptor function and response of semiconductor gas sensor are described, following the illustrations of some relevant key {{issues such as}} tunneling transport. Depletion in small semiconductor crystals {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of new <b>type</b> <b>depletion</b> (volume depletion) after conventional one (regional depletion), and inclusion of both types makes it possible to formulate the receptor function and response to oxygen (air base), oxidizing gas (nitrogen dioxide), and reducing gas (hydrogen). The equations derived theoretically using physical parameters of the semiconductor side and chemical parameters of the gases side appear to reproduce satisfactorily the sensing behavior to the aforementioned gases as well as the influence of changes in physical parameters such as grain size and donor density. Extension to the semiconductor crystals dispersed with surface electron-traps shows that the traps act as a sensitizer to promote sensor response...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of CO 2 and H 2 O in a synthetic beryl having a peculiar hourglass zoning of Cr {{due to the}} crystal growth. The sample was treated at 800 °C, 500 MPa, in a CO 2 -rich atmosphere. High-resolution FESEM images revealed that the hourglass boundary is not correlated to physical discontinuities, {{at least at the}} scale of tens of nanometers. Polarized FPA-FTIR imaging, on the other side, revealed that the chemical zoning acts as a fast pathway for carbon dioxide diffusion, a feature never observed so far in minerals. The hourglass zone boundary may be thus considered as a structural defect possibly due to the mismatch induced by the different growth rates of each sector. High-resolution synchrotron-light FTIR imaging, in addition, also allows enhancement of CO 2 diffusion along the hourglass boundary to be distinguished from diffusion along fractures in the grain. Therefore, FTIR imaging provides evidence that different diffusion mechanisms may locally combine, suggesting that the distribution of the target molecules needs to be be carefully characterized in experimental studies. This piece of information is mandatory when the study is aimed at extracting diffusion coefficients from analytical profiles. Combination of TOF-SIMS and FPA data shows a significant <b>depletion</b> of <b>type</b> II H 2 O along the hourglass boundary, indicating that water diffusion could be controlled by the distribution of alkali cations within channels, coupled to a plug effect of CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to verify the 5 -year results of the MOPPEBVCAD {{chemotherapy}} regimen with limited radiotherapy {{in relation to the}} promising preliminary data. Mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, epidoxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, lomustine, melphalan, and vindesine were delivered according to a schedule derived through hybridization, intensification, and shortening of the corresponding alternating CAD/MOPP/ABV regimen. Radiotherapy was restricted to sites of bulky involvement or to areas that responded incompletely to chemotherapy. This multicenter, controlled, nonrandomized trial involved 145 eligible patients. Radiotherapy was administered to 47 patients, 46 of whom were in complete remission after chemotherapy. Remissions were complete in 137 patients (94 %), partial in 4 (3 %), and null in the remaining 4. Tumor-specific, overall, relapse-free, and failure-free survival at 5 years were 0. 89, 0. 86, 0. 82, and 0. 78, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was considerable, whereas nonhematologic side effects were fully acceptable. Most of the unfavorable prognostic factors lost their clinical weight. Only age and lymphocyte <b>depletion</b> histologic <b>type</b> were statistically correlated with major follow up endpoints; performance status and bone marrow involvement were subordinate to age. Seven patients developed a second cancer (including 3 myelodysplasias). MOPPEBVCAD with selected radiotherapy is a highly effective regimen in advanced Hodgkin´s disease. Early and late toxicity are no more severe than what would be expected with other alternating or hybrid regimens. A comparison with ABVD, which is currently considered the standard regimen for advanced Hodgkin´s disease, is needed...|$|R
