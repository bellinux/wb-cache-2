5|$|The Doctor and {{the rest}} of the {{excursion}} party attempt to reach the bridge but are repeatedly attacked by the ship's Angel Hosts, androids resembling angels who were programmed to supply information but are now eliminating all passengers and crew. Morvin falls off of a ledge into the ship's engine, {{and the rest}} of the group are surrounded by Angel Hosts. Bannakaffalatta reveals that he is a cyborg, and uses his internal EMP device to disable the Hosts. The EMP burst drains the Zocci's power cells and he dies. Mr. Copper takes the EMP device, saying that if they can manage to recharge it, they can use it against the Hosts again. A lone Angel Host attacks them again, and Foon ties herself to it and throws them both into the ship's engine. The Doctor separates from the rest and attempts to reach Deck 31, where he hopes to find the controls for the Heavenly Hosts. He convinces the Hosts that he is a stowaway - neither passenger nor crew and thus not in the Hosts' kill mandate - and the confused androids take him to see their operator, Max Capricorn. Max explains that he planned the Titanics inevitable collision with Earth to bankrupt the company that voted him out. To save the Doctor, Astrid uses a <b>forklift</b> to ram Max Capricorn and push him into the ship's engine. The <b>forklift</b> falls into the engine on top of him, seemingly killing Astrid as well.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a <b>forklift</b> truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E
25|$|Most {{companies}} in Europe and the US {{do not use}} petroleum-powered <b>forklifts,</b> as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric <b>forklifts.</b> Fuel cell-powered <b>forklifts</b> can provide benefits over battery-powered <b>forklifts</b> as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes. Fuel cell-powered <b>forklifts</b> {{can be used in}} refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The FC units are often designed as drop-in replacements.|$|R
50|$|PEM fuel-cell-powered <b>forklifts</b> provide {{benefits}} over petroleum powered <b>forklifts</b> as {{they produce}} no local emissions. While LP Gas (propane) <b>forklifts</b> are more popular and often used indoors, they cannot accommodate certain food industry applications. Fuel cell power efficiency (40-50%) {{is about half}} that of lithium-ion batteries (80-90%), {{but they have a}} higher energy density which may allow <b>forklifts</b> to run longer. Fuel-cell-powered <b>forklifts</b> are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not as affected by temperature as some types of lithium batteries. Most fuel cells used for material handling purposes are powered by PEM fuel cells, although some DMFC <b>forklifts</b> are coming onto the market. In design the FC units are often made as drop-in replacements.|$|R

5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, <b>forklift,</b> and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E
5|$|With Spider-Man cast, filming was set {{to begin}} the {{following}} November in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. On March 6, forty-five-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a <b>forklift</b> modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the <b>forklift</b> power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the problem of <b>forklifts</b> {{engagement}} in warehouse loading operations. Two expert system (ES) models are created using several machine learning (ML) models. Models try to mimic expert decisions while determining the <b>forklifts</b> engagement in the loading operation. Different ML models are evaluated and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and classification and regression trees (CART) are chosen as the ones which have shown best results for the research purpose. As a case study, a central warehouse of a beverage company was used. In a beverage distribution chain, the proper engagement of <b>forklifts</b> in a loading operation is crucial for maintaining the defined customer service level. The created ES models represent a new approach for the rationalization of the <b>forklifts</b> usage, particularly for solving the problem of the <b>forklifts</b> engagement in cargo loading. They are simple, easy to understand, reliable, and practically applicable tool for deciding on the engagement of the <b>forklifts</b> in a loading operation. </p...|$|R

When she applied for the job at BNSF, her previous experience operating forklifts was noted by Marvin Brown, her interviewer at BNSF. White was hired as a “track laborer,” a job that involves removing and replacing track components, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, she was assigned to operate the <b>forklift.</b> While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the <b>forklift</b> was White’s primary responsibility.|$|E
