5|$|The American crow is all black, with {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black corvids. They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not <b>hunch</b> and fluff their throat feathers when they call.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully get wind of {{this bizarre}} car chase as they're doing work in Buhl, Idaho {{investigating}} possible domestic terrorism. Mulder coerces Scully into taking a detour to Elko, Nevada on a <b>hunch</b> {{that this may}} be an X-File. Crump, who has started to develop symptoms of a sickness, is put in an ambulance. Mulder, wishing to speak to Crump, follows the ambulance, and ends up being kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to <b>hunch</b> and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hunching</b> {{has always}} caused problems, for {{instance}} in occupational groups like dentists, surgeons, hairdressers, nurses, chefs, teachers, computer workers and students. Some rheumatoid conditions like ankylosing spondylitis and neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease cause characteristic excessive thoracic kyphosis. What has changed {{is the amount of}} <b>hunching</b> in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young.|$|R
5|$|Mansell, {{with three}} ships (the 30 gun Hope {{along with the}} 42 gun Victory and the Answer) {{departed}} and patrolled about Dungeness. Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this <b>hunch</b> Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a <b>hunch</b> upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|When the {{calutron}} {{was first}} operated on 2 December 1941, {{just days before}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, a uranium beam intensity of 5 microamperes (μA) was received by the collector. Lawrence's <b>hunch</b> about the effect of the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed. A nine-hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms (μg) of uranium enriched to 25% uranium-235, about ten times as much as Nier had produced. By February, improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1,400 μA beam. That month, 75 μg samples enriched to 30% were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a <b>hunch</b> that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

25|$|Griffin {{scored a}} coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto {{the set of}} Play Your <b>Hunch</b> during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him {{to stay for a}} {{spontaneous}} interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do You Trust? for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts, and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.|$|E
25|$|From 1958 to 1962, Griffin {{hosted a}} game show {{produced}} by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman called Play Your <b>Hunch.</b> The show appeared on all three networks, but primarily on NBC. He also hosted a prime time game show for ABC called Keep Talking. Additionally, he substituted for {{a week for the}} vacationing Bill Cullen on The Price Is Right, and also for Bud Collyer on To Tell the Truth. In 1963, NBC offered him the opportunity to host a new game show, Word for Word, which Griffin produced. He also produced Let's Play Post Office for NBC in 1965; Reach for the Stars for NBC in 1967; and One in a Million for ABC in 1967.|$|E

40|$|Beam-hunching is {{the most}} {{important}} process of the heam-wave interaction mechanism in klystron devices, and it is usually characterised by the <b>hunching</b> current which is described by the following linear and ballistic expression [7]: Here Io is the initial beam current, tu the instance when the beam reaches the ridge centre and x is the bunching parameter. If we assume that the electron transit time is negligible compared to the field oscillation period, the <b>hunching</b> parameter may he given as (4) tion of the <b>hunching</b> Current when both the fringe field and finite beam transit time are taken into account. This not only confirms the applicability of the TLM method to beam-wave interaction problems, but more importantly demonstrates the feasibility of removing the density averaging requirement...|$|R
25|$|Having {{received}} the secret message, Artemis decides {{the only option}} is to break into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums, who {{had worked as a}} builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had a <b>hunch</b> that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.|$|E
25|$|Before Cal's {{newspaper}} goes to press, Collins goes {{on record}} {{to present his}} research into PointCorp. Collins's estranged wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn), whose conversation with Cal seems to imply a past love triangle dating back to their college years, reveals that she knows {{the amount of money}} Sonia received from PointCorp, after just hearing Collins's statement to the newspaper. After the couple leaves, Cal realizes that Collins knew already that Sonia was working for PointCorp. Cal wonders what Collins would have done had he known he had been tricked and whether Collins himself is connected with Sonia's assassin. A picture of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's <b>hunch.</b> Collins reveals that he had been suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army Corporal Robert Bingham (Michael Berresse), whose life Collins had once saved. Collins says that Bingham hated PointCorp more than he did, and that he killed Sonia with no authorization from him.|$|E
