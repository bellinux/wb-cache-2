An overhumidification of inspired gases, positive airway hydric balance, gives anatomic-physiological alterations of airways and lung parenchyma. During invasive mechanical ventilation, the practice of active hot humidifiers has a positive or level airway hydric balance.

50|$|Many {{applications}} use two-fluid nozzles {{to achieve}} a controlled small drop size over a range of operation.

SAW TRANSDUCER AS A GAS SENSOR Systems with surface acoustic wave (SAW) have been applied in the construction of gas detectors for a long time [1 - 4]. The SAW gas sensors are composed of at least one acoustic delay line with a sensitive thin film layer on a top of the piezoelectric substrate and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDT) for excitation and detection of Rayleigh wave (see Fig. 1). In this paper results of investigations of two types of primary electronic circuits are presented and discussed. The first one is the oscillator with frequency output signal and the second is the phase-shift output circuit. 2. FREQUENCY OUTPUT CONDITIONING CIRCIUT As a conditioning circuit for SAW sensors the electronic oscillators are often applied – the delay line with SAW transducer is placed in the feedback loop of an amplifier. The acoustic delay line ensures the phase condition for oscillation, whilst the amplifier ensures the amplitude condition. The main disadvantages of this simple configuration are high output frequency range (30 – 150 MHz) and a weak thermal stability. Therefore a much more suitable configuration in practical applications is the dual delay line design with the active and the reference acoustic paths, as shown in Fig. 2...|$|R
