5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies did {{not provide}} strong {{evidence}} for an increased Parkinson's disease (PD) risk after exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF), but were limited in their scope to address other exposures related {{to the use of}} electricity such as <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> We evaluated the associations of PD with exposure to ELF-MF, <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> and having worked in "electrical occupations. " We conducted a hospital-based case-control study, including 444 PD patients and 876 age- and sex-matched controls. Occupational histories were collected in telephone interviews and were linked to job-exposure matrices on ELF-MF exposure and on <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> In addition, questions on use of household appliances involving ELF-MF exposure, experienced <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> and potential confounders were asked. No association of PD risk with any of the evaluated exposures related to electricity was observed. We did, however, observe quite consistently reduced risk estimates across the majority of the exposure categories explored. Given the results of the previous studies and the absence of any postulated mechanism, this is unlikely to represent a true protective effect of ELF-MF or <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> on the occurrence of PD. The {{results of this study suggest}} that no association exists between PD and exposure to ELF-MF, <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> or having worked in "electrical occupations. "...|$|R

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{has been}} associated with exposures in so-called 'electrical occupations'. It is unclear if this possible link may be explained by exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) or by <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> We evaluated ALS mortality in 2000 - 2008 and exposure to ELF-MF and <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> in the Swiss National Cohort, using job exposure matrices for occupations at censuses 1990 and 2000. We compared 2. 2 million workers with high or medium vs. low exposure to ELF-MF and <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> using Cox proportional hazard models. Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1. 55 (95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 15)), but closer to unity for <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> (HR 1. 17 (95 % CI 0. 83 - 1. 65)). When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1. 56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0. 97. In conclusion, there was an association between exposure to ELF-MF and mortality from ALS among workers with a higher likelihood of long-term exposure...|$|R
25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School.

25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep. A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely {{from one end to}} the other. The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move to the other end of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move to the other end of the box and avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{studied the}} {{association}} between occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the Nordic Occupational Cancer cohort (NOCCA). Methods: We included 5, 409 adult AML cases diagnosed between 1961 and 2005 in Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and 27, 045 controls matched by age, sex, and country. Lifetime occupational ELF-MF exposure and risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> were assigned to jobs reported in the censuses using job-exposure matrices. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) using conditional logistic regression adjusted for concurrent occupational exposures relevant for AML risk (e. g., benzene, ionizing radiation). We conducted sensitivity analyses with different assumptions to assess the robustness of our results. Results: Approximately 40 % of the subjects were ever occupationally exposed to low levels and 7 % {{to high levels of}} ELF-MF, whereas 18 % were ever at low risk and 15 % at high risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> We did not observe an association between occupational exposure to neither ELF-MF nor <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> and AML. The HR was 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 77 – 1. 01) for subjects with high levels of ELF-MF exposure and 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 85 – 1. 05) for subjects with high risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> as compared to those with background-level exposure. Results remained materially unchanged in sensitivity analyses with different assumptions. Conclusion: Our results do not support an association between occupational ELF-MF or electric shock exposure and AML...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the summer and}} winter total protein content of 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 40 -day old Apis mellifera L. worker venom glands before (control) and 24 and 96 hours after applying <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> for venom extraction (experimental). During venom extraction, 7 -day old workers responded more slowly and weakly to <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> This response intensifies with age, so that the workers approaching 20 days old respond faster and more aggressively to the shocks. Statistical analysis, using the non-parametric Wilcoxon and Kruskall-Wallis tests and complemented by the Jonckheere test, showed that the protein content varied from one age to another in the experimental group, which was well distinguishable from the values in the control Group in summer and winter. Summer values at all ages were always higher than those detected in winter in both groups. This variation seems to indicate the occurrence {{of more than one}} winter glandular development cycle. Histological studies showed secretion in the lumen of the control Group secretory tubes and reservoirs. The experimental group only showed vestigial secretion in the collapsed reservoirs at all ages, except at 7 days. These workers, which reacted less efficiently to <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks,</b> showed secretion in the lumen, reservoir, and tubes, even after the application of <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> During the 96 hours following the <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks,</b> a slight protein replacement was seen at some ages. This, although higher in summer than in winter, was much lower than the level detected in the control group at all ages. The significantly lower values were frequent in the older workers 96 hours after extraction and could reflect reabsorption or degradation of proteins from glandular secretion due to aging. Our results show that venom extraction is more productive in summer using older workers. However, their capacity of replacing protein eliminated during stinging of the substrate, in response to shocks is shown to be low, as demonstrated for other analyzed bees...|$|R
