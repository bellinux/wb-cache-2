These three different, but inter-relating, methods or aims of mystical involvement are also found throughout the other pre-Kabbalistic and post-Kabbalistic stages in Jewish mystical development, as three <b>general</b> <b>typologies.</b> As in Kabbalah, the same text can contain aspects of all three approaches, though the three streams often distill into three separate literatures {{under the influence of}} particular exponents or eras.|$|R
40|$|Attributed by its {{breakthrough}} {{performance in}} interference networks, interference alignment (IA) has attracted great {{attention in the}} last few years. However, despite the tremendous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA processing remains unclear for most network typologies. The IA feasibility analysis is challenging as the IA constraints are sets of high-degree polynomials, for which no systematic tool to analyze the solvability conditions exists. In this work, by developing a new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of sets of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their first order terms, we propose a sufficient condition that applies to K-pairs MIMO interference networks with <b>general</b> <b>typologies.</b> We have further proved that the sufficient condition aligns with the necessary conditions under some special configurations.

Architects not only looked for unattempted block structures but also their quest for unattempted block structures were continued for internal places, too and internal implicit setups were designed using ortographic tools like plans and sections.

These radical perceptional, spatial changes and spatial scenarios are particularly emphasized in museum buildings. These new spatial arrangements in circulation areas are offering new spatial experiences with irregular gaps in sections, regular but non-geometric floor plans, vagueness of the borders, striking colors, patterns and materials, differentiated circulation parts (stairs, moving stairways, elevators, platforms, bridges).

The Methods-Strands Matrix includes both monomethod and mixed methods designs, but {{the emphasis is}} on the more complex and adaptable mixed ones. The article starts with a brief discussion of why typologies of mixed methods designs are valuable at this time. The Methods-Strands Matrix is produced by crossing number of methods employed (monomethod, mixed methods) by number of research strands (single, multiple). The multistrand, mixed methods cell in the matrix includes four families of MM designs: sequential, concurrent, conversion, and fully integrated. Examples of each of these strands are presented. Quasi-mixed designs are also described in which qualitative and quantitative data are collected, but there is no true integration of the findings or inferences for the overall study. We conclude {{that it is impossible to}} create a complete taxonomy of mixed methods designs, because they have an evolving nature that can spin off numerous permutations. The article concludes with a seven-step process for selecting the most appropriate mixed methods design for a research study.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} {{an investigation into}} situated teacher learning and their developing understandings of the affordances of new computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools. In-service teachers need to identify the affordances that a new tool offers for language learning {{in order to make}} decisions about which technologies they will choose to support their teaching practice. While <b>general</b> <b>typologies</b> of affordance have been identified for technology use in learning, the kinds of affordance that language teachers perceive in technology have not been specified. Sixteen tertiary teachers in Australia and New Zealand were interviewed over a period of fourteen months with reference to the knowledge they acquired around the use of new technologies in their classrooms. The term ‘learning affordance’ was coined to describe ways in which teachers perceived use of CMC tools promoted language learning in the classroom. Participants identified that new tools allowed students to engage not only with the traditional content of language learning (language skills and learning about the L 2 culture) but also to engage with the processes of learning language (in relation to communication, affective factors and autonomy). Teachers also saw affordances for their teaching in relation to these areas. Implications for in-service teacher development include supporting participatory activities for on-going teacher learning such as inquiry, observation and reflection...|$|R
40|$|Forms of {{employee}} representation have been legally institutionalised {{in most of}} the EU countries. These ER regimes have also been recently framed in European directives. However, there exists a great variety of institutional ER structures among the Member States: union-based or works council type; single or dual channel, complementary or exclusionary. Institutional differences exist also in the powers assigned to the ER, in particular whether the ER has not only consultation, but also co-determination rights (see for example DE). A next dimension of diversity is the role these bodies play in collective bargaining. In many systems they play only an additional role in relation to supra-company bargainng, in other countries they have a key role. Recently theoretical classifications have been constructed to cluster these different institutional regimes. We can refer to the <b>general</b> <b>typologies</b> of Visser (2009) and Bryson et al. (2012) of IR-regimes. More specific has been the typology of Altmeyer (2005), which is also applied by Van den Berg et al. (2013). Management style, type of body, assigned powers, bargaining role are used to develop a 5 -type model. However, this clustering has never been empirically tested.

40|$|This article explores how Anglo-American {{financial}} firms since the 1980 s have operated and acted {{in an increasingly}} deregulated, risky, and uncertain arena. I look at these firms and their actions with a particular focus on “temporality” and requisite “emotion-rules,” where variations in emotion-rules correspond with organizational definitions of uncertainty. Firms impose specific emotion-rules, depending on national policies, official duties, and interpretations of each risk. In finance, caveat emptor (i. e., buyer or lender distrust) is an emotion-rule set in screening policies and data collection for credit risks and risks of fraud by personnel, and it gives rise to actual emotions. I argue that three time-orientations are significant in creating emotion-rules. If a past, present, or a long-term future is deployed to construct a future, that creates and frames an institution’s attempts to manage uncertainty. Looking exclusively at Anglo-American corporate finance policies and strategies (often deemed the international “one best way”), six modes of certainty constructions are presented. Each is assessed against the dispositions and emotional strategies required in highly-skilled careers, in specific organizational settings. The relative influence of individual perspectives, institutional rules and <b>general</b> <b>typologies</b> of social action is assessed and found to comprise one past view, three present views, and one future-oriented perspective towards the future. Implications are outlined for emotion-rules relevant to financial careers and office. This article was written before the full financial crisis unfolded, which the argument here substantially foreshadows. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Without any doubt, {{sport has}} become a major {{consumer}} market, either we discuss about practicing any kind of sport at professional or amateur level, or we are just interested by a competition, sport organization or an athlete as a regular consumer. From this last perspective, we can distinguish between two types of behaviors, respectively the spectator and the supporter or fan. Each of these two typologies has its own characteristics which define, in a significant manner, the consumer behavior. A correct understanding and management of this phenomenon, of the factors that influence the attitudes and the decisions taken by the respective consumer, of the display manner for the consumer behavior have a major importance from the management and marketing point of view. This paper focuses on the football consumer and describes, first of all, the main characteristics of each of the typologies mentioned above from this perspective, presenting also the reasons for their transition from passive supporter to fan. Another issue we approach in the current paper refers to the changes appeared in the consumer behavior when the market segment is represented by those supporters whose teams are either relegated or liquidated, which is a global phenomenon in the football area. Having in mind this aspect and taking into consideration the influence of media (TV, press, Internet, social media etc), some individual benchmarks that influence those consumer’s behavior are identified {{within the context of the}} <b>general</b> <b>typologies</b> previously mentioned. These influences help the consumer to obtain benefits or satisfaction similar to those already lost. The findings may be used in further research focused on that particular market segment and could provide the necessary support data for further development of proper techniques and tools for reshaping and changing the respective consumer behavior...|$|R
