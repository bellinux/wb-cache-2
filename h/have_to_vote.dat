25|$|On December 27, 1847, when Young {{organized}} a new First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve only had seven of its twelve members present {{to represent a}} council to decide the Presidency. William Smith, John E. Page, and Lyman Wight had previously denounced the proceedings and were not present. John Taylor and Parley P. Pratt were in the Salt Lake Valley and {{could not have known}} of the proceedings. This left just seven present, a majority of one meaning Young would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for himself in order to gain a majority quorum vote in favor of his leadership. Young chose two of the other apostles, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards, as his counselors in the First Presidency. This left only four members of the Quorum of the Twelve present to vote in favor of creation of the new First Presidency: Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and Orson Pratt. The Church of Jesus Christ views this action as a violation of church law compromising the authority of Sidney Rigdon without a majority quorum vote. The LDS Church actively opposes this view of the proceedings.|$|E

2500|$|In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron {{was picked}} to fill Foley's {{spot in the}} November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law {{prohibited}} Foley's name from being removed from the ballot {{at the time of}} his withdrawal from the race, but Republicans hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a substitute candidate. [...] Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, [...] "to vote for this candidate, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Mark Foley.

[...] Negron used the slogan, [...] "Punch Foley for Joe", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican where it had stood since July to Leans Democratic in early-October.

2500|$|For his own part, Zhirinovsky {{has done}} a great deal to foster a {{reputation}} as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear.

Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available.

2500|$|Two {{key events}} {{in the life of}} the new Iraqi Republic {{occurred}} during the deployment of the 1–206th FA, the return to Iraqi sovereignty in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 on 28 June 2004, and the first Iraqi National Elections on 30 January 2005. The 39th BCT was instrumental in the January 2005 elections. The battalion was responsible for working with the 307th ING Battalion to establish and secure six different polling sites within the battalion's area of operations. In order to avoid jeopardizing the credibility of the election process, it was necessary to avoid a United States Military presence at the polling sites. This meant that the security at the polling sites would be the responsibility of 307th ING Battalion alone. Battalion leaders spent countless hours planning and coordination with Iraqi counterparts and governmental elections officials. The task at one polling site was even more complicated. Over 3000 Iraqi army soldiers living on the Iraqi side of Camp Taji wished to vote, but in order to prevent a perception of military control of the ballot box, it was determined that these soldiers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> outside the camp at the village of Assyria, and they would be unarmed.

2500|$|When the new Reichstag first assembled, Papen {{hoped to}} use the {{opportunity}} to drop all pretense of democracy. [...] He obtained in advance from Hindenburg a decree to dissolve it, then secured another decree to suspend elections for the time being. When the Reichstag met on 12 September 1932, it managed to elect Hermann Göring as its speaker, which {{was followed by a}} Communist motion of no confidence in the Papen government. Papen had anticipated this gambit, however. He knew that the Communist no-confidence motion would only be entertained if the other parties all agreed to a last-minute change in the Reichstags agenda. Alfred Hugenberg had promised Papen that the DNVP would object to the Communist motion. Hearing reports that the NSDAP and the Zentrum were in talks about forming a new government, Hugenberg ordered the DNVP not to object to the change in agenda without telling Papen {{as part of an effort}} to save his government as he believed the Nazis would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against the Communist no-confidence motion to avoid a new election. However, when no one objected, Papen ordered one of his messengers to fetch the dissolution decree. Göring phoned Hitler in Munich, asking him whether the Nazis should vote for the Communist no-confidence motion, and was ordered to vote ja (yes). Papen demanded the floor in order to read the dissolution decree, but Göring pretended not to see him. The motion carried by 512 votes to 42-a result that German historian Eberhard Kolb described as a defeat [...] "such as had never been known in German parliamentary history." [...] Angry and red-faced as Göring ignored him, Papen threw the decree dissolving the Reichstag at him and stormed out. [...] Realizing that he did not have nearly enough support to go through with his plan to subvert the republic from within, Papen decided to call another election to punish the Reichstag for voting against his government. Papen had planned not to call another election after dissolving the Reichstag, but he changed his mind after the NSDAP and the Zentrum threatened to use Article 59 of the constitution, which allowed for impeachment of the president if he violated the constitution, and after Hindenburg's lawyers informed him that dissolving the Reichstag without scheduling new elections was an impeachable offense.|$|E

60|$|All this is, in {{a humble}} manner, true for romance. Romance is a {{shortening}} and sharpening {{of the human}} difficulty. Where you and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against a man, or write (rather feebly) against a man, or sign illegible petitions against a man, romance does for him what we should really like to see done. It knocks him down; it shortens the slow process of historical justice. All romances consist of three characters. Other characters may be introduced; but those other characters are certainly mere scenery {{as far as the}} romance is concerned. They are bushes that wave rather excitedly; they are posts that stand up with a certain pride; they are correctly painted rocks that frown very correctly; but they are all landscape--they are all a background. In every pure romance there are three living and moving characters. For the sake of argument they may be called St. George and the Dragon and the Princess. In every romance there must be the twin elements of loving and fighting. In every romance there must be the three characters: there must be the Princess, who is a thing to be loved; there must be the Dragon, who is a thing to be fought; and there must be St. George, who is a thing that both loves and fights. There have been many symptoms of cynicism and decay in our modern civilisation. But of all the signs of modern feebleness, of lack of grasp on morals as they actually must be, there has been none quite so silly or so dangerous as this: that the philosophers of to-day have started to divide loving from fighting and to put them into opposite camps. There could be no worse sign than that a man, even Nietzsche, can be found to say that we should go in for fighting instead of loving. There can be no worse sign than that a man, even Tolstoi, can be found to tell us that we should go in for loving instead of fighting. The two things imply each other; they implied each other in the old romance and in the old religion, which were the two permanent things of humanity. You cannot love a thing without wanting to fight for it. You cannot fight without something to fight for. To love a thing without wishing to fight for it is not love at all; it is lust. It may be an airy, philosophical, and disinterested lust; it may be, so to speak, a virgin lust; but it is lust, because it is wholly self-indulgent and invites no attack. On the other hand, fighting for a thing without loving it is not even fighting; it can only be called a kind of horse-play that is occasionally fatal. Wherever human nature is human and unspoilt by any special sophistry, there exists this natural kinship between war and wooing, and that natural kinship is called romance. It comes upon a man especially in the great hour of youth; and every man who has ever been young at all has felt, if only for a moment, this ultimate and poetic paradox. He knows that loving the world is the same thing as fighting the world. It was at the very moment when he offered to like everybody he also offered to hit everybody. To almost every man that can be called a man this especial moment of the romantic culmination has come. In the first resort the man wished to live a romance. In the second resort, in the last and worst resort, he was content to write one.|$|E
