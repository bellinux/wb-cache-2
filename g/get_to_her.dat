5|$|Nina enrolls at Erinsborough High {{after her}} school work suffers {{because she has}} been {{travelling}} the world with her parents, Nick and Trixie. Nina is shy and concealed {{as a result of}} her neglect by her parents. Nina takes up two jobs at the Coffee Shop and at Lassiter's Hotel. The residents of Ramsay Street begin to notice that she is shy and has low self-esteem. One night, Harold Bishop hears Nina singing and realises that she is good, but Nina disagrees. Harold manages to convince Nina to join the church choir, and she is asked to perform a solo, but her nerves <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and is not able to go through with their performance. Connor O'Neill also overhears Nina singing one day and becomes close with her, as he is the only teenager who knows about her talent.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E

He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.|$|E

On 25 March 1437, the six-year-old was formally crowned King of Scots at Holyrood Abbey. The Parliament of Scotland revoked alienations of crown property and prohibited them, {{without the consent of}} the Estates, that is, until James II's eighteenth birthday. He lived along with his mother and five of his six sisters (Margaret had left for France, where she had married the future Louis XI of France) at Dunbar Castle until 1439.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says.

[...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related {{to the use of}} special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
500|$|The Chandler's shop at Union Street, as {{depicted}} in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room {{on the second floor}} with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen, and three-year-old Elizabeth. On the night of [...] 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs. Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly. Although the shop was near the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders. Meanwhile, Ayres, wearing only a nightdress, had tried to reach her sister but was unable to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> through the smoke. The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump. Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it. Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself, she left the window and returned carrying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught {{by a member of the}} crowd. Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1800 Galatea escorted {{a convoy}} from Cork through the Channel to the Downs.

However, {{for the next ten}} days the weather blocked Campbell from contact with Galatea.

2500|$|Lammy {{wakes up}} and realises she only has 15 minutes to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> concert, she is blocked off by a fire. As the Chief Puddle {{attempts}} to get Lammy to help {{put out the fire}} since she's in a hurry, Lammy notices a billboard for a casino. Recalling Chop Chop's words, Lammy pictures her fire hose as a guitar and gains the confidence she usually has whilst playing. After putting out the fire, Lammy is rewarded with some pizza but eats so much that she is mistaken as a pregnant lady by Nurse Cathy Piller. Upon realizing she wasn't actually pregnant, Cathy forces Lammy to help put all the newborns to sleep using a baby as a guitar. As she leaves she slips on a skateboard and is launched in to a plane that was flying through the street. She then helps Captain Fussenpepper fly the plane while he is attacked by a ceiling panel, which makes him switch personalities. She ends up crash landing the plane into the middle of a full parking lot. Accidentally leaving her guitar on the plane upon leaving, Lammy goes to build a new one from scratch with the help from a beaver named Paul Chuck. By pretending her chainsaw is a guitar she is able to turn a tree in to a fully functional and painted guitar. Upon leaving with the new guitar, Lammy either slips on a banana peel and dies, where she's taken to the netherworld (Japan and PAL) or gets her belt snagged on [...] the shop door, propelling her backwards through time and onto a strange island (U.S). After being dragged into performing in a concert for idol Teriyaki Yoko, Lammy manages to earn the right to be brought back to Earth using a fax machine, but not before running into her evil twin Rammy, Yoko's original guitarist.
