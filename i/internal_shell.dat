5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an <b>internal</b> <b>shell.</b> Fleshy papillae or cirri are found {{along the bottom of}} the arms, and the eyes are more developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name Octopoda was first coined and given as {{the order of}} octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of 300 known species and {{can be divided into}} two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the <b>internal</b> <b>shell</b> of incirrates is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.|$|E
25|$|Most slugs {{retain a}} remnant of their shell, which is usually internalized. This organ {{generally}} serves as storage for calcium salts, often {{in conjunction with the}} digestive glands. An <b>internal</b> <b>shell</b> is present in the Limacidae and Parmacellidae.|$|E
50|$|Piliscus is a genus {{of small}} sea snails with {{transparent}} <b>internal</b> <b>shells,</b> marine gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Velutinidae. Because the <b>shell</b> is mostly <b>internal,</b> these snails resemble sea slugs in general appearance.|$|R
25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>shells</b> of the {{different}} species of Limacidae are not recognizable to the species level. Therefore, the fossil distribution of Limax maximus (and other Limacidae species) is unknown. Unidentified calcitic shells of Limacidae are known from European Tertiary and Quaternary deposits.|$|R
50|$|Conchologists mainly {{deal with}} four {{molluscan}} orders: the gastropods (snails), bivalves (clams), Polyplacophora (chitons) and Scaphopoda (tusk shells). Cephalopods only have small <b>internal</b> <b>shells,</b> {{with the exception}} of the Nautiloidea. Some groups, such as the sea slug nudibranchs, have lost their shells altogether, while in others it has been replaced by a protein support structure.|$|R
25|$|Cuttlefish or cuttles are marine {{animals of}} the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also {{includes}} squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique <b>internal</b> <b>shell,</b> the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell of}} Limax maximus is reduced and internal, under the shield. The {{occurrence}} of this <b>internal</b> <b>shell</b> {{was known to}} Pliny the Elder; the shell {{was used by the}} ancient physicians for the sake of its carbonate of lime.|$|E
25|$|Slug, or land slug, is {{a common}} name for any {{apparently}} shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word slug is also often used {{as part of the}} common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small <b>internal</b> <b>shell,</b> particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).|$|E
50|$|Apart from mollusk shells, other shells {{that can}} be found on beaches are those of barnacles, {{horseshoe}} crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of sea urchins are called tests, and the moulted shells of crabs and lobsters are called exuviae. While most seashells are external, some cephalopods have <b>internal</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|AGB stars {{become more}} luminous, larger, and cooler as they lose mass and the <b>internal</b> <b>shells</b> {{move closer to}} the surface. Mass loss {{increases}} as the mass decreases, the luminosity increases, and more fusion products are dredged up to the surface. They [...] "ascend" [...] the AGB until the mass loss becomes so extreme that they start to increase in temperature and enter the post-AGB phase, eventually to become a white dwarf.|$|R
5000|$|Nautiluses are {{the only}} extant {{cephalopods}} which have an external shell. (For information on a very large extinct subclass of shelled cephalopods, please see Ammonites.) Cuttlefish, squid, spirula, vampire squid, and cirrate octopuses have small <b>internal</b> <b>shells.</b> Females of the octopus genus Argonauta secrete a specialised paper-thin eggcase in which they partially reside, and this is popularly regarded as a [...] "shell", {{although it is not}} attached to the body of the animal.|$|R
2500|$|The shells develop {{from the}} {{ectoderm}} as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralised. [...] In Sepia, {{which has an}} <b>internal</b> <b>shell,</b> the ectoderm forms an invagination whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited.|$|E
2500|$|Nautiluses are {{the only}} extant {{cephalopods}} with a true external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in cuttlefish (Sepia spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell (cuttlebone) that is internal in the adult. [...] The {{same is true of}} the chitinous gladius of squid and octopuses. Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports, which are sometimes referred to as a [...] "shell vestige" [...] or [...] "gladius". The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an <b>internal</b> <b>shell,</b> and some squid also lack a gladius. [...] Interestingly, the shelled coleoids do not form a clade or even a paraphyletic group. [...] The Spirula shell begins as an organic structure, and is then very rapidly mineralized. [...] Shells that are [...] "lost" [...] may be lost by resorption of the calcium carbonate component.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} certain coleoids {{are known}} from the Mississippian sub-period of the Carboniferous Period, about 330 million years ago. Some older fossils have been described from the Devonian,but paleontologists disagree about whether they are coleoids. [...] Other cephalopods with <b>internal</b> <b>shells,</b> which could represent coleoids but may also denote the independent internalization of the shell, are {{known from the}} Silurian. It {{is possible that the}} Early-Middle Cambrian fossil Nectocaris represents a coleoid (or other cephalopod) that lost its shell, possibly secondarily.|$|R
50|$|Sea snails are marine {{gastropods}} with shells. Those marine gastropods with no <b>shells,</b> or only <b>internal</b> <b>shells,</b> are variously {{known by}} other common names, including sea slug, sea hare, nudibranch, etc. The diversity within sea snails is enormous. Many very different clades of gastropods are either dominated by, or consist exclusively of, sea snails. Because {{of this great}} variability, generalization about the feeding, reproduction, habitat, or other traits of sea snails is not possible. Instead, individual clades, families, genera, or species must be assessed.|$|R

50|$|Opinions vary as {{to whether}} aulococerids were endocochleate, having <b>internal</b> <b>shells</b> as with modern squid, or were ectocochleate, having {{external}} shells as with nautilods and ammonites. Naef (in Bandel 1985) thought of aulacocerids as slender squids that looked similar to recent ones; morphologically similar to belemnites {{on one hand and}} to orthocerids on the other, but with a mantle that completely covered the shell; making them endocochliate. Jeletzky (in Bandel 1985) considered that aulocerids were essentially ectocochleate and that they lacked a muscular mantle, the rostrum having been secreted by mantle flaps that could be folded over the chambered shell, but were not fused around it, and which could be withdrawn into the long living chamber.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe atomic {{stiffness}} parameter (ASP) {{in dense}} phases: S = 9 νBε- 1 where v stands for atomic volume, B for bulk modulus and ε for atomic cohesive energy expresses {{the competition between}} metallic attraction and core-core repulsion. ASP {{is driven by the}} repulsive interaction between electronic more or less filled <b>internal</b> <b>shells</b> since attractive metallic bonding is common for all metals. The square root of ASP was early introduced as anharmonicity parameter η by Rose et al. ASP controls the occurrence of local defects in crystalline structures. Since crystalline defects are essential for cluster structures, surface rearrangements and grain boundary structures, i. e. nanostructures, ASP also controls bulk malleability and ductility. The ASP set of composite materials controls their tendency to form quasicrystals and amorphous materials. Nanometric friction between materials also depends on respective ASP values. ASP values define several classes of metals, according to their ability to bear non-homogeneity. So called " extra stiff " metals have completely filled <b>internal</b> electronic <b>shells,</b> noble metals are " very stiff " while numerous metals are more or less smooth. This stiffness classification is linked with structural properties of nanostructures...|$|R
