50|$|Thicknet coaxial cabling is {{used with}} Ethernet 10BASE5 networks, has a maximum cable length of 500 meters and {{transmission}} speeds of 10 Mbit/s. It's expensive and not commonly used, {{though it was}} originally used to directly connect computers.

5000|$|Television {{providers}} and broadcasters have touted {{the advantages of}} being able to access content across multiple platforms, including on the internet, and on mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) as part of their existing television subscription. The TV Everywhere concept has received criticism for being difficult for end-users to set up, while media activists have criticized the concept for being a paywall that extends the existing oligarchy of the subscription television industry to the internet, and considering it to be collusion against [...] "cord cutters"â€”those who <b>drop</b> <b>cable</b> and satellite entirely in favor of accessing content via terrestrial television, the internet, and subscription video on demand (SVOD) services.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time the company also {{released}} the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents {{a significant portion of the}} total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a [...] "drop cable" [...] system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single <b>drop</b> <b>cable,</b> and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.|$|E
5000|$|In {{second quarter}} 2011, Comcast lost 238,000 {{television}} customers, compared to 265,000 a year earlier, {{though the company}} was making up for these losses with increases in other services such as Internet. Moffett said the slowing rate indicated that online sources were not making people <b>drop</b> <b>cable</b> as quickly. On the other hand, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications lost more customers in the quarter than in 2010. Time Warner Cable lost 130,000, while Dish Network lost 135,000; by comparison, DirecTV gained 26,000 subscribers, compared to 100,000 the previous year. Nielsen Media Research estimated {{that the number of}} households with at least one television set had decreased from 115.9 million to 114.7 million, while also estimating an increase in program viewing by computer, tablets or smartphones. Services such as U-verse were increasing their subscriber numbers by offering special features: U-verse's [...] "My Multiview" [...] option allowed people to watch four channels at once, while Cablevision's [...] "iO TV Quick Views" [...] allowed the display of up to nine channels at once.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in power electronics components enable {{the use of}} power electronics in Low Voltage (LV) networks. This development makes the model of a Low Voltage Direct Current (LVDC) distribution system possible. The technical and economical benefits of this technology make possible the alternative hypothesis of using DC instead of AC distribution systems. Some aspects, such as increasing the capability of the existing lines, interconnecting distributed generation units and even supplying in DC some loads are creating additional requirements of using a LVDC distribution system. The paper presents some general considerations regarding cables used in a LVAC distribution system and different line reconfigurations which enable the use of cobles in a LVDC distribution system. The reconfigurations are presented in respect of the DC network topologies: unipolar and bipolar. The central aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate capability of power transmission and to calculate the transmission distance for cables used in Low Voltage AC and DC distribution systems. Capability computation is considered in respect of two constrains imposed in the cables cross section selection: cable thermal limit and the maximum allowable voltage <b>drop.</b> <b>Cable</b> thermal limit is represented in calculations by the maximum rated current. The equations used to calculate the power capability are presented for single-phase and three phase AC networks and unipolar and bipolar DC networks. Based on these equations, comparisons between power capability of cables with different cross sections used in Low Voltage DC and AC distribution systems are realized and presented...|$|E
5000|$|The Hooper's Telegraph Works Ltd was {{established}} by William Hooper in 1870 to manufacture and lay submarine communications cable. The company's first order was for a 2,300 nautical mile cable linking Vladivostock with Hong Kong, via Shanghai. The company also <b>dropped</b> <b>cable</b> for the Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company. The company commissioned the C. S. Hooper, then the world's second largest cable laying vessel. Due to the haste with which the ship was required, it was assembled in just 100 days. The ship was also used to freight trade between the United States and Great Britain on the Boston-London shipping route. [...] The company was placed into liquidation in 1877, and by 1894 was trading as Hooper's Telegraph and India Rubber Works Ltd.|$|R

5000|$|Industry {{resistance}} to {{a la carte}} programming in the U.S. has been entrenched even during downturns. In 2011, for example, a combined loss of 1.2 million subscribers to Comcast and Time Warner Cable prompted rumors that program distributors themselves would push to unbundle {{at least some of}} their services. Cable analyst Craig Moffett argued that a modified a la carte model, consisting of smaller programming tiers, was more economically feasible for distributors and customers alike. At the time, Time Warner Cable experimented with such an offering in a limited trial, called TV Essentials. [...] IDC analyst Gary Ireland called such skinny bundles [...] "simply a placeholder for a la carte" [...] and predicted that consummer demand for the pricing scheme would eventually triumph. At the end of 2015, 20.4% of U.S. households had either <b>dropped</b> <b>cable</b> service or never subscribed in the first place.|$|R

Former Bell Media president Kevin Crull explained that television content on any streaming service [...] "not exist if you didn't have the traditional TV system.

50|$|A Nielsen report {{showed that}} during {{the fourth quarter of}} 2011, the number of people paying for {{television}} had dropped by 15 million people (a rate of 1.5 percent), and the number of <b>cable</b> subscribers <b>dropped</b> by 2.9 million. A 2012 Deloitte report said 9% of television households <b>dropped</b> <b>cable</b> service during 2011 and an additional 11% planned to cancel their service. Sanford Bernstein estimates 400,000 dropped pay video services during the second quarter of 2012, up from 340,000 in 2011. One reason for the drop was college students' returning home for the summer, while the companies made up for the loss in other quarters. However, the number of new homes paying for television service is less than the total number of new homes. Another possible reason is services, such as time shifting and live recording capabilities, that were once exclusive to pay television services, are now being offered to cord cutters. Although the number of subscribers usually increases in the third quarter, in 2012 only 30,000 people added pay television service, {{according to a study by}} the International Strategy & Investment Group. Cable lost 340,000 subscribers (with Time Warner Cable accounting for 140,000 of that number) and satellite gained only 50,000; telephone companies added 320 subscribers. Throughout 2012, pay television added only 46,000 new subscribers, out of 974,000 new households overall, according to SNL Kagan. 84.7 percent of households subscribed, compared to 87.3 percent in early 2010.|$|R
