The WSF- 02 spacecraft included {{a set of}} payloads provided by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, known as TexasSat. One of the TexasSat payloads was a GPS TurboRogue receiver loaned by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. On September 11, the WSF- 02 was unberthed from the Endeavour payload bay using the remote manipulator system. The GPS receiver was powered on prior to release and the WSF- 02 remained in free-flight for three days before being retrieved on September 14. All WSF- 02 GPS data, which includes dual frequency pseudorange and carrier phase, were stored in an on-board recorder for post-flight analysis, but "snap- shots" of data were transmitted for 2 - 3 minutes at intervals of several hours, when permitted by the telemetry band- widdl The GPS experiment goals were: (1) an evaluation of precision orbit determination in a low altitude environment (400 km) where perturbations due to atmospheric drag and the Earth's gravity field are more pronounced than for higher altitude satellites with high precision orbit requirements, such as TOPEX/POSEIDON; (2) an assessment of relative positioning using the WSF GPS receiver and the Endeavour Collins receiver; and (3) determination of atmospheric temperature profiles using GPS signals passing through the atmosphere. Analysis of snap-shot telemetry data indicate that 24 hours of continuous data were stored on board, which includes high rate (50 Hz) data for atmosphere temperature profiles. Examination of {{the limited number of}} real-time navigation solutions show that at least 7 GPS satellites were tracked simultaneously and the on-board clock corrections were at the microsec level, as expected.

Thepresented work focus on the wind estimation based on real flight experiments {{as part of the}} SkyScanner project. The overall objective of the project is to estimatethe local wind field in order to study the formation of cumulus-type clouds with a fleet of autonomous mini-RPAs. Generally, wind field measurements have beendone by using a commercial 5 -hole probe, such as the one from AEROPROBE. This is an expensive and heavier solution. With the help of algorithmic estimationof the wind field, multiple smaller and cheaper RPAs can be used for atmospheric measurements. On this study, a small UAV has been equipped with a classical pitot-static tube for airspeed, a hall effect rotary encoder for angle of attack, and the AEROPROBE for reference values. Location of the on-board sensors has been carefully selected {{in order to reduce the}} flow effects coming from the vehicle geometry.

They also provide {{a unique opportunity to}} perceive the terrain-robot interactions by listening to the sounds generated during locomotion. Legged robots such as hexapod robots produce rich acoustic information for each gait cycle which includes the foot fall sounds and feet pushing on the terrain (support phase), as well as the sounds produced when the feet travel through the air (stride phase). Interpreting this information to perceive the terrain it is traversing makes available another valuable sensing modality which can feed in to higher level systems to facilitate robust and efficient navigation through unknown terrain.

40|$|Flight {{testing of}} the {{performance}} seeking control (PSC) excitation mode was successfully completed at NASA Dryden on the F- 15 highly integrated digital electronic control (HIDEC) aircraft. Although the excitation mode {{was not one of}} the original objectives of the PSC program, it was rapidly prototyped and implemented into the architecture of the PSC algorithm, allowing valuable and timely research data to be gathered. The primary flight test objective was to investigate the feasibility of a future measurement-based performance optimization algorithm. This future algorithm, called AdAPT, which stands for adaptive aircraft performance technology, generates and applies excitation inputs to selected control effectors. Fourier transformations are used to convert measured response and control effector data into frequency domain models which are mapped into state space models using multiterm frequency matching. Formal optimization principles are applied to produce an integrated, performance optimal effector suite. The key technical challenge of the measurement-based approach is the identification of the gradient of the performance index to the selected control effector. This concern was addressed by the excitation mode flight test. The AdAPT feasibility study utilized the PSC excitation mode to apply separate sinusoidal excitation trims to the controls - one aircraft, inlet first ramp (cowl), and one engine, throat area. Aircraft control and response <b>data</b> were <b>recorded</b> using <b>on-board</b> instrumentation and analyzed post-flight.

40|$|Networks of Windprofiler Radars {{have the}} {{capability}} to make significant contributions to severe weather forecasting (both on the ground and in the air) through the determination of real-time turbulence strengths, but the potential has still not been fully realized. In order to better understand the accuracy of profilers in determination of turbulence strengths, we have compared radar measurements made at the Harrow radar in Canada (located in Southwestern Ontario as part of the O-QNet radar network) with in-situ measurements made by multiple aircraft. These included measurements made both by commercial aircraft and dedicated research aircraft. Research aircraft (instrumented with accelerometers and GPS tracking devices) and radar data were analysed using structure function, spectral and spectral-width methods. <b>Data</b> were also <b>recorded</b> <b>on-board</b> commercial aircraft using accelerometer-based studies, and results were recorded for subsequent analyses. Over 92, 000 commercial aircraft measurements, 4000 h of radar data, and 15 days of research-aircraft measurements were available for this study, although only a subset of the commercial aircraft data were useable. The radar-based spectral-width method occasionally produced anomalous negative values of the turbulence strength, usually associated with weak turbulence coupled with significant wind variability over scales of tens of kms, but the aircraft data also had limitations. For the commercial aircraft, frequent zeros were common, also associated with weak turbulence. With regard to the research aircraft measurements, it was found through both spectral and structure function analyses that spectral contaminants exist out to scales of many tens of metres (larger than often assumed), but proper allowance for these effects permitted good estimates of turbulence strength. Spatial and temporal variability was large, however, complicating comparisons with the radar. By comparing the in-situ data to the radar data, it has been possible to place stronger limits on the constants used to determine radar turbulence strengths. Subsequent comparisons with the commercial aircraft data over a six-month period have then been used to show that aircraft and radar probability distributions agree in form, but that the aircraft data are three to five times larger. Corrections for this bias lead to good agreement, both in form and absolute values, for all three data sets. Crown Copyright 9 2013. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
