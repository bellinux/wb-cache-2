Kitsis {{confirmed}} that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds, as they [...] "love the idea of going back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life." [...] The writers' desire to present a [...] "mash up" [...] of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, {{in which there is a}} war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, [...] "One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories is thinking of ways these different characters can interact <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> never have before." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics are}} more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any {{intention}} of presenting an allegorical message.

All that stuff with Charlie– [...] the [...] "Heil Hitler!" [...] business– [...] sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." [...] In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: [...] "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we may have encouraged it– [...] like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> may not be used to seeing".|$|E

500|$|Few {{details of}} Luba's pre-Palomar life {{surfaced}} in earlier stories. [...] "Act of Contrition" [...] (1984) flashes {{back to her}} teenage nightclubbing days, and Hernandez recreates a panel from these flashbacks in Poison River. [...] The story traces the first eighteen years of Luba's life, known to long-time Love and Rockets fans as the [...] ("bath-giver") of the fictional Latin American village of Palomar. [...] Luba rarely takes center stage in the narrative; rather, she provides a focal point around which {{the stories of the}} otherwise unrelated large cast of characters come together. [...] The characters lives are intertwined <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> are never aware of. [...] An example: a terrorist attack forces Ofelia, Luba, and Ofelia's mother Hilda to flee and permanently injures Ofelia's back; the coordinators of the attack are associates of Peter Rio, whom Luba meets and marries in the city Luba and Hilda eventually make their way to.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Wirtualna Polska {{ranked the}} [...] "visionary" [...] Another World as the 15th best {{game for the}} Amiga, remembering it for a {{cinematic}} feel and [...] "uncommonly" [...] high difficulty (for a first-time player) and calling it [...] "one {{of the most important}} titles in the history of electronic entertainment." [...] In 2012, 1UP.com ranked this [...] "short-but-sweet cinematic action game" [...] as the 99th most essential video game of all time, commenting: [...] "Especially in an age of entertainment where fans cry out for pages upon pages lore and glossaries for the tiniest minutiae of their fiction, Out of this Worlds dimension contains a sense of mystery that makes it all the more lonely, and often, quietly beautiful. The game can be brutal and heartbreaking, but Chahi's amazing vision makes [...] a thoroughly gripping experience." [...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> weren't expecting. The game's vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time, and the pacing of the heavy, nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape," [...] and adding that [...] "slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard-earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film also {{features}} Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock's childhood, including his abuse {{at the hands}} of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock's initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls [...] "... a friendship that will define them both <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> cannot yet realize." [...] A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock's involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock's home planet.|$|E
2500|$|On-screen, Guerrero {{responded to}} Bischoff's actions by forming the Latino World Order (LWO), {{which was a}} {{take-off}} of Bischoff's New World Order. The group was an answer to Bischoff's [...] "refusal" [...] to push Latino wrestlers <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> felt they deserved. The LWO was formed in October when Guerrero returned to WCW, with Héctor Garza and Damien. The group eventually grew to encompass almost all the Mexican wrestlers working for WCW at the time. They mainly feuded with Rey Mysterio Jr. and Billy Kidman because they wanted Mysterio to join the group. He faced Kidman in a match for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship but Mysterio interfered and helped Kidman win the match and keep the title. However, Guerrero {{was involved in a}} car accident on New Year's Day 1999 that cut short the LWO storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing one’s background object. [...] A background object is someone on whom individuals have come to rely <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> did not realize until the object is no longer present. [...] For instance, the relationship served as a mutual regulatory system. Multiple psychobiological systems helped to maintain individuals’ equilibrium. [...] As members of a couple, they became external regulators for one another. They were attuned on many levels: their pupils dilated in synchrony, they echoed one another’s speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms. [...] As a couple, they functioned like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other’s bio rhythms, responding to one another’s pheromones, and addicting to the steady trickle of endogenous opiates induced by the relationship. [...] When the relationship ends, the many processes it helped to regulate go into disarray. [...] As the emotional and bio-physiological effects mount, the stressful process is heightened {{by the knowledge that}} it was not you, but your loved one who chose withdraw from the bond. This knowledge may cause people to interpret their intense emotional responses to the disconnection as evidence of their putative weakness and ‘limited capacity to perform the work of conquest’.|$|E
2500|$|On May 21, 2014, Smith {{appeared}} {{along with}} other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted {{under the guidance of}} the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
