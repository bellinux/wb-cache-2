Adsorptions of model anionic compound - methyl orange (MO) and fenolic acid derivative – vanillic acid by linked starch containing tertiary amino groups (TKTE) were analyzed in different temperatures. Adsorption izoterm curve calculations were performed based on Lengmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich absorpion models, thermodynamic adsorption rates were calculated. It was found that equally substituted TKTE is able to adsorb amounts of vanillic acid that are nearly double compared to the amounts of MO. The desorption of TKTE adsorbed vanillic acid was analyzed.

PharmDr. Petr Zimčík, Ph. D. Title of Thesis Synthesis of tetrapyridoporphyrazines with {{potential}} photodynamic activity Substituted tetrapyridoporphyrazines represent new structural type of potential photosensitizers with interesting properties for application in photodynamic therapy. The {{aim of this}} work was to synthesize two types of tetrapyridoporphyrazines with hydrophilic substituents as potential photosensitizers. Photosensitizers are substances with an ability to produce singlet oxygen after activation by light. Singlet oxygen is the key toxic species in photodynamic therapy. 2 -Chloro- 5, 6 -dimethylpyridine- 3, 4 -dicarbonitrile (1) was prepared in the first step by condensation of tetracyanoethylene and butan- 2 -one. In the next step, a hydrophilic substituent was attached by nucleophilic substitution. The first precursor was prepared by reaction of compound 1 with 2 -mercaptoethanol {{in the presence of}} sodium hydroxide. Similarly, the second precursor was obtained by reaction of compound 1 with <b>diethylaminoethanol</b> in the presence of sodium hydride. The third step involved cyclotetramerization with magnesium butoxide as [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Human IgG is a {{well-established}} multifunctional antigen specific immunoglobulin molecule of the adaptive immune system. However, an antigen nonspecific immunological function of human IgG {{has never been}} reported. In this study, human IgG was isolated using ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation and <b>diethylaminoethanol</b> (DEAE) cellulose 52 ion exchange chromatography, from which h-IgG and hs-IgG fractions were purified {{on the basis of}} their differential binding to rabbit anti-shrimp hemocyanin antibody (h) and rabbit anti-shrimp hemocyanin’s small subunit antibody (hs), respectively. We found that h-IgG had a higher hemolytic activity than hs-IgG against erythrocytes from humans, rabbits, mice and chickens, whereas the control IgG showed negligible activity. h-IgG could interact directly with erythrocyte membranes, and this interaction was suppressed by high molecular weight osmoprotectants, showing that it may follow a colloid-osmotic mechanism. In comparative proteomics and glycomics studies, h-IgG and hs-IgG yielded 20 and 5 significantly altered protein spots, respectively, on a 2 -D gel. The mean carbohydrate content of h-IgG and hs-IgG was approximately 3. 6 - and 2 -fold higher than that of IgG, respectively, and the a-D-mannose/a-D-glucose content was in the order of h-IgG. hs-IgG.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of fibrinolysis in thromboembolic disease {{is of great}} importance. In this communication the authors present striking evidence of fibrinolysis induced by drugs. ARECENTLY published tabulation ' of simple organic compounds reported to induce some weak fibrinolytic activity includes only compounds known to influence vasomo-tion (procaine, epinephrine, diethylaminoeth-anol). Studies in our laboratory concerning the influence of vasomotor drugs on the clot-ting mechanism {{have resulted in the}} obser-vation that intravenously administered nico-tinic acid induces rather strong fibrinolytic activity. 2 This paper presents data on the in-fluence of representative vasomotor drugs on the clotting mechanism, and particularly on fibrinolysis. METHODS Rates of peripheral blood flow were measured in man in a constant temperature-constant hu-midity room by methods previously described. 3 Clotting tests included 1 -stage prothrombin time (whole and diluted plasma), 4 recalcification time, 5 antithrombin activity 6 and fibrinolytic activity, both by test tube observation 7 and the coagulo-graph ("thromboelastograph " of Hartert). 8 9 Drugs studied in man included nicotinic acid (orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, and intra-arterially), nicotinamide (intravenously), calcium gluconate (intravenously), <b>diethylaminoethanol</b> (intravenously), histamine (intravenously), papav-erine (intravenously and intra-arterially) and llidar (intra-arterially).

40|$|PROCAINE amide was {{introduced}} {{for the treatment}} of cardiac arrhythmias 6 years ago. Since then a number of studies with the compound have been reported. A review of the results may help in appraising the value of the drug as a therapeutic agent. The first step toward the development of procaine amide was taken when Mautz, ' in 1936, showed that procaine, applied directly to the myocardium of animals, elevated the threshold of ventricular muscle to electric stimulation. Beck and Mautz 2 then demon-strated that the topical application of procaine in surgery involving stripping of the peri-cardium, reduced the occurrence of ventricular and atrial extrasystoles. In 1946, Burstein 3 reported that procaine was an effective anti-arrhythmic agent when injected intrave-nously, and he employed it in anesthetized patients prophylactically as well as thera-peutically. Although of undoubted effective antiarrhythmic activity, procaine has limited use in the general treatment of arrhythmias because of its central stimulatory effects, which restrict its use to anesthetized patients. A study on the fate of procaine in man showed that the drug after intravenous injec-tion was enzymatically hydrolysed in plasma with extreme rapidity to para-aminobenzoic acid and <b>diethylaminoethanol.</b> 4 The rapid hydrolysis of procaine suggested that its anti-arrhythmic action might be mediated through one of the metabolites. Para-aminobenzoic acid was found to have no antiarrhythmi...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to purify and {{localize}} the nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) from hybrid tilapia (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus X Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus). The purification procedures involved affinity chromatography with a 2 ', 5 '-ADP-agarose 4 B column and ion exchange with a <b>diethylaminoethanol</b> Bio-Gel A column. The results from gel filtration assays showed that the molecular weights of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) were 178 and 120 kDa, respectively. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results showed that there were three bands with molecular weights of 89, 47, and 29 kDa from the purified nNOS. However, only one band, with a molecular weight of 120 kDa, appeared on the gel from the purified iNOS. Hybrid tilapia nNOS was a dimer structure, while iNOS appeared to be a monomer structure. Moreover, our results revealed that the activities of nNOS and iNOS were significantly higher after the addition of Ca+ 2 or Mg+ 2 ions individually. However, when L-arginine and NADPH were present, the addition of I mM of either ion did not further increase the activity. The chemical L-N-G-methyl-L-arginine could inhibit the activities of the purified NOSs with or without L-arginine. Western blot analyses showed only an 89 -kDa immunoreactive band from the extracts of cerebrum; however, we did not find the specific bands in other tissues, such as gill, intestine, liver, spleen, and anterior kidney. We found another 120 -kDa immunoreactive protein band with the rabbit antirat iNOS serum against iNOS from the extracts of anterior kidney and spleen. The results of immunohistochemistry with the rabbit antihuman nNOS serum indicated that the nNOS existed in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, diencephalons, and nerve cell bodies and neuronal fibers of the spinal cord. Interestingly, only macrophages from anterior kidney and spleen showed positive reactions with the rabbit antirat iNOS serum. In the same way, the endothelial NOS (eNOS) located in the heart and epithelial cells of the blood vessels reacted positively with the rabbit antibovine eNOS serum...|$|E
