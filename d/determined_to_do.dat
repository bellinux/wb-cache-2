To that end, the Lady Managers sought a coin to sell in competition with the commemorative half dollar at the Exposition, which Congress had approved in 1892. [...] Passage of the half dollar legislation had been difficult, and the Lady Managers decided to wait until the next session of Congress to make their request.

500|$|Stephen {{moved into}} his brother Edmund's house in Lakeview, {{a suburb of}} Paterson, New Jersey, {{in the fall of}} 1891.

Crane focused particularly on The Bowery, a small and once prosperous neighborhood {{in the southern part of}} Manhattan. [...] After the Civil War, Bowery shops and mansions had given way to saloons, dance halls, brothels and flophouses, all of which Crane frequented. He later said he did so for research.

While in the service, he began his political activities, distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging {{the passage of the}} [...] "Fourteen Powers" [...] referendum of 1944, which would have expanded the powers of the federal government.

500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better the {{following}} year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and I doubt very much if we could have done any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E

Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not {{to fight a war}} in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E

500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get in the way of his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open her eyes for more than a second but was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geauga, Garfield {{worked for}} a year at various jobs, {{including}} teaching. Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named Hiram College) in Hiram, Ohio, a school run by the Disciples. While there, he was most interested {{in the study of}} Greek and Latin, but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered. Securing a position on entry as janitor, he was hired to teach while still a student. Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute, and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek. He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches, in some cases earning a gold dollar per service. By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher. Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, as a third-year student, given credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was impressed with the college president, Mark Hopkins, who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, [...] "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other." [...] Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days, [...] "There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions." [...] After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal, Vermont, a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A. Arthur.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement {{about whether or not the}} war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, reminding us that the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E
