40|$|Abstract—The stress {{concentration}} of the electrothemal microactuator {{is an important issue}} in the MEMS structure resulting from the existence of {{stress concentration}} essentially to change the performance and reduce the structural life time of MEMS devices. This paper proposes a method to optimize the <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> of the electrothermal V-beam microactuators due to bent beam connected with electrical pad. The genetic algorithm combines with the finite element method to design the optimal <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> of bent beam. A novel design of the <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> on V-beam actuator can significantly improve the stress concentration. In this study, we use the proposed method to design the beam width and thickness to obtain the relative minimum stress, firstly.

40|$|The {{isothermal}} local loading forming technology {{provides a}} feasible way to form Ti-alloy large-scale rib-web components in aerospace and aviation fields. However, the local loading process forming limit is restricted by forming defects in the transitional region. In this work, {{the feasibility of}} controlling forming defects and improving the process forming limit by adjusting die parameters is explored through finite element (FE) simulation.

This kind of pocket cavities, due to the high Reynolds number and the specific shapes, are hardly investigated in previous researches. The heat transfer distribution and fluid flow over the pocket cavity have significant effects on the incoming flow of the OGV in the downstream distribution. In the present work, the specified triangular pocket cavities are built in a high aspect ratio channel and heat transfer and fluid flow over the pocket surface are investigated experimentally and numerically. These pocket cavities are built with different radii to find out optimized heat transfer distributions and flow patterns. Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT) is employed to measure heat transfer over the pocket surfaces at Reynolds number ranging from 87, 600 to 219, 000.

Second, a custom-built equipment to measure the bending angle during the forming process, together with the metal temperature, was implemented.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the impact of filleted edges variations on heat transfer. In real gas turbines, sharp edges are an approximation, because of manufacturing tolerances and/or geometrical modifications occurring during operation. The value of <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> is not exactly known a priori. It can be assumed that a specific radius occurs with a probability following a probabilistic distribution. For this reason, the effect of variation of the filleted edge on internal channel of a film cooling configuration has been studied numerically using an in house solver. The hole exit is fan-shaped and the feeding duct axis and the main stream are perpendicular to each other. A response surface has been generated varying the internal Mach number of coolant and the pressure ratio range between coolant and main gas. Four fillets radii for the internal duct have been analysed, r/D= 0. 0 - 5 %. A Gaussian distribution for the <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> has been assumed. Using the over mentioned distributions it is possible to obtain the probabilistic functions of the corresponding discharge coefficient, C d, and adiabatic effectiveness, h. The overall variation of C d and h can be more than 10 % the value without fillet. Furthermore the differences on Cd due to the uncertainties on <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> are bigger than those obtained modifying the exit duct shape (i. e. from cylindrical to fanshaped). This paper shows that the effect of variation of fillet radii must be included in numerical simulations. This has direct consequences on LES and DNS simulations, which normally include sharp corners or mean radii. A probabilistic approach must be included in the analysis of the results and the equivalent <b>fillet</b> <b>radius</b> assumed instead...|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis {{was done}} at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro. It treats how the {{geometry}} of impact pistons in hydraulic percussive rock drill hammers can be improved. The material in these pistons is highly loaded during each impact and there are cases where fatigue failure has occurred. One critical location for fatigue damage is the fillet between the boom and {{the tail of the}} piston. This is because the stress pulse from the impact is amplified in this area. By developing a full transient analysis for a piston in ANSYS, and by using design optimization, a new type of fillet was constructed from a cubic b-spline. This new fillet has the same length as the old <b>fillet,</b> a double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet,</b> on the piston tail, but it has 12 ‒ 16 % lower maximum stress range, depending on the stress measure. A special feature with this fillet is that it is cut into the material of the boom. In that way it could be longer than the double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet</b> which enables a larger radius of curvature and a longer distance to “lead” in the stress pulse into the tail. This results in lower stress ranges in the fillet. Several multiaxial stress fatigue methods were used to analyze the fatigue damage in the old double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet</b> and in the new undercut fillet. It was found that the double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet</b> has a safety factor of 0. 98 ‒ 1. 08 to infinite fatigue life and the undercut fillet has a safety factor of 1. 10 ‒ 1. 23 to infinite fatigue life, depending on the fatigue method. Because infinite fatigue life normally corresponds to 106 ‒ 107 equivalent stress cycles, and the piston is desired to withstand close to one billon impacts, the old double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet</b> does not leave any margins to effects which can occur in the giga-cycle regime. The undercut fillet on the other hand leaves some margins to these kinds of effects. Unfortunately, no fatigue parameters were known for the material in the considered piston, so they were estimated from empirical relations. During the work with the undercut fillet it was realized that the weight of the impact piston can be reduced by minimizing the weight of the piston tail without affecting its performance. By using design optimization with the constraint that the maximum stress range in the piston tail should not be larger than the maximum stress range in the double <b>radius</b> <b>fillet,</b> its weight was reduced by 38 %. With this change in mass, less energy is needed to accelerate the piston and less reflection energy is needed to be damped out. Validerat; 20130917 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
