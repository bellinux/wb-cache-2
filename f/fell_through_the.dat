5|$|Thunder Runs {{design was}} {{originally}} intended for Americana Amusement Park {{in the late}} 1980s; Dinn Corporation was contracted to manufacturer a wooden roller coaster designed by Curtis D. Summers and John Fetterman, before the plans <b>fell</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> design was later used {{as the foundation for}} International Coasters' only two roller coasters which are located at Carowinds and Kings Dominion, both named the Hurler.|$|E
5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for more than two hours. Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E

5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike <b>fell</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early {{settlement}} period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans <b>fell</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|The actor John Payne {{attempted}} {{to take up}} the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise <b>fell</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> novel was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal <b>fell</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the native people of the Dutch East Indies began to hold a greater degree of nationalism, {{evidenced}} in part by the establishment of several nationalist publications. Armijn, Hamzah, and Alisjahbana, three writers from Sumatra, laid the foundation for their magazine in September 1932. They sent letters to forty contributors to the literary section of the newspaper Pandji Poestaka requesting submissions, as well as support from ten sultanates. When a deal with Dutch-owned publishing house Kolff & Co. <b>fell</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> founders agreed to self-publish. The resulting magazine, Poedjangga Baroe, was first published in July 1933. During its publishing run, the magazine took a wider scope and saw greater involvement from politically inclined persons. After the Japanese occupation of the Indies in 1942, the magazine ceased publication. Another magazine under the Pudjangga Baru banner was published from 1948 until 1954.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the late 1970s, the Bruins {{were looking for a}} new arena. The Boston Garden was {{approaching}} 50 {{years old at the time}} and new owners, The Jacobs family, were looking to build a 17,000 seat arena in suburban Boston after negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> with <b>the</b> City of Boston. The team nearly moved to Salem, New Hampshire around where Rockingham Park is today. That <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> and <b>the</b> Bruins continued to reside in Boston Garden. The Celtics, also looking for a new arena, considered moving to Revere, Massachusetts.|$|R

5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roof of the emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, {{but no one was}} injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|Scootie Randall {{returned}} to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's Talor Battle, who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20–11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35–33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat {{out the rest of}} the game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team led by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62–61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took the ball to the hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended the Owl lead to 64–61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernandez. Fernandez was double-teamed and was forced to take an off-balance 18-footer. The ball <b>fell</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hoop with four seconds remaining, and Temple Owls won 66–64. Fernandez and Moore finished with 23 points, a season high for Fernandez.|$|E
