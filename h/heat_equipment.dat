A recent application of evaporative air cooling equipment in a heat treat area at the John Deere Component Works in Waterloo, Iowa provided the required cooling at an operating cost of 30 % of a city water coil and 10 % of a chilled water system. At the same time, the evaporative cooing system had the lowest first cost.

40|$|This paper shows a {{study on}} {{energetic}} consumption of BTSs (Base Transceiver Stations) for mobile communication, related to conditioning functions. An energetic "thermal model" of a telecommunication station is proposed and studied. The results have been validated with a BTS in central Italy, showing good agreement. Findings show a substantial high internal-external temperature difference in the containing shelter, particularly during daytime and warm months, due to sources of <b>heat</b> (<b>equipment,</b> external temperature and sun radiation) and to the difficulty in spread the warmth out. The necessity to keep the operating temperatures within a given range for the correct functioning of the electronic equipment {{requires the use of}} conditioning setups, and this significantly increases the energetic demand of the whole system. The analysis of thermal flows across the shelter can help to gather further data on its temperature behavior and to devise practical measures to lower the power demand, while keeping the operating parameters in the suggested ranges. The investigation of some operating parameters of the equipment and of the shelter, such as threshold set-points, air vent area, external wall transmittance and reflectivity, suggests annual energy savings between 10 % and 30 %.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{equipment is}} one of the main unit operations in many industrial processes such as heating, cooling, transportation and power generation. Thus, convective heat transfer plays a major role in the <b>heat</b> <b>equipment.</b> In the past years, liquids such as water, oil and ethylene glycol had been used as the heat transfer fluids. These fluids have a major drawback since they possess low thermal conductivity. Thus innovation in developing advanced heat transfer fluids is needed in many industrial applications so that more energy efficient and compact systems can be achieved. This is the main impetus of this work. A nanofluid is a liquid suspension that consists of nano-sized solid particles. In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and titanium dioxide (Ti 02) were utilized in formulating nanofluids. The shape and morphology of these nanoparticles make it a challenge in producing long term stable nanofluids. CNT nanofluids were produced using sonication and higher shear mixing, while the Ti 02 nanofluids were produced by using the beads mill. The CNT nanofluids dispersion stability was enhanced by the aid of gum arabic surfactant and the Ti 02 was stabilized by means of electrostatic stabilization mechanism at pH - 11. 0. The nanofluids were characterised using electron microscopy and size analyzer. The multi-wall CNTs have a diameter of < lOnm and length up to micron size, thus the aspect ratio is huge. The primary particles of Ti 02 have an average diameter of 30 - 40 nm. The heat transfer study involves several measurements and analysis: i) the thermal conductivity measurements, ii) viscosity analysis and iii) convective heat transfer measurements. A significant enhancement was observed for thermal conductivity of CNTs nano fluids, where nanoparticles concentration of 0. 25 wt...|$|E

40|$|Residential {{space and}} water heating {{accounts}} for over 90 {{percent of total}} residential primary gas consumption in the United States. Condensing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> are 10 - 30 percent more energy-efficient than conventional space and water heating. Currently, condensing gas furnaces represent 40 percent of shipments and are common in the Northern U. S. market. Meanwhile, manufacturers are planning to develop condensing gas storage water heaters to qualify for Energy Star? certification. Consumers, installers, and builders who make decisions about installing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> generally do not perform an analysis to assess the economic impacts of different combinations and efficiencies of space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment.</b> Thus, equipment is often installed without taking into consideration the potential life-cycle economic and energy savings of installing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> combinations. Drawing on previous and current analysis conducted for the United States Department of Energy rulemaking on amended standards for furnaces and water heaters, this paper evaluates {{the extent to which}} condensing equipment can provide life-cycle cost-effectiveness in a representative sample of single family American homes. The economic analyses indicate that significant energy savings and consumer benefits may result from large-scale introduction of condensing water heaters combined with condensing furnaces in U.

40|$|In {{the milk}} industry, the {{production}} {{must be stopped}} daily in order to clean the process equipment from deposits that are formed at the inside surface when the products are heat treated. This leads reduced production time since no products can be treated when the equipment are being cleaned. The heat treatment of milk products is necessary {{to ensure that the}} product is safe to consume. When heat treating the milk, certain compounds in the milk become unstable and form a deposit called fouling inside the heating equipment. This fouling layer reduces the heat transfer from the <b>heat</b> <b>equipment</b> to the product that is supposed to be heat treated. In order to remove the fouling deposit cleaning with first alkaline and then acidic detergent are used. It can take up to a few hours before the equipment is cleaned depending on the degree of fouling. The aim of this master’s thesis is to develop a laboratory method for measuring cleaning efficiency of UHT fouling by using cleaning detergents at different temperatures and concentrations. The method was created by looking on how a Cleaning-In-Place process is performed and imitates these steps at a laboratory level, by performing experiments on storage, drying, size and separation of fouling. The cleaning method was evaluated according to repeatability and ability to distinguish cleaning effects of the different cleaning liquids. A cleaning method for dissolution of UHT fouling was achieved where it was possible to detect trends of degree of dissolved fouling when different temperature and concentration of cleaning liquids were used in the sodium hydroxide step. The repeatability of the cleaning method was sufficient to be able to detect the cleaning trends. The cleaning effect trials showed that higher temperature and concentration leads to more fouling dissolved. It was also seen that with higher concentration of alkaline detergent a lower temperature could be used to achieve a similar cleaning compared to lower concentration of alkaline detergent...|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{large number}} of studies in {{industrial}} waste processing, this field is still a challenge. In this regard, new processing capabilities emerging from the use of high frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) <b>heat</b> <b>equipment</b> are a positive factor to be researched. In HF and MW processing the heating process is determined by absorption of electromagnetic wave power through the processed material. This electromagnetic wave power is transmitted by the substance atoms and spent for heating a sample, polarization, and initiation of chemical reactions. The non-conductor (dielectric and semiconductor) material heat is explained by the existing effect of dielectric losses due to losses caused by the through electrical conductivity and slow processes of polarization. The dielectric losses due to electrical conductivity result from the Joule heat released when through-current flows through the dielectric. The differences in frequency radiation of HF and microwave equipment define their different technological capabilities. HF-radiation represents almost homogeneous field between the plates of a running capacitor. With multiple reflection from the chamber walls MW-radiation is randomly distributed within the chamber. Thus, radiation partly returns to the generator, thereby affecting the equipment performance capability and life time. Microwave heating is uneven. The depth of penetration into the material is much less to HF-processing. HF heating features are high penetration of radiation and uniform heating of the material. Together with pre-pressing it can afford an opportunity to join the non-standard pieces of plastic to have the larger insulating items. The fact of the selective effect on the material is positive when processing the waste. Since the tangent of angle of dielectric losses of materials such as wood is directly proportional to humidity, the heating automatically stops as wood dries. This fact was used to produce for the fuel briquettes, which were modified by waste of polyethylene. Using the authors’ snap enables producing the sawdust briquettes with enhanced heat of combustion. Using the waste of pulp and paper industry was successful in creating the arrays of hydrolytic lignin for their use as a fuel or an insulation material. The presence of temperature gradient contributed to the mass-transfer of low boiling and water-soluble compounds to the sample surface, and, thus, to its hardening. The thermal insulation properties of produced material are higher than those of wood, claydite-concrete, etc. thereby making it advanced for further research. The article draws a conclusion from the theoretical and experimental studies that the use of НF power for of waste processing has unconditional prospects. </p...|$|E

Consideration is given to heat losses in clear air (no liquid water present in the atmosphere) and in probable conditions of icing and snow.

Existing types of <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> which could be used to supply this quantity of heat would probably be too bulky and heavy to provide a practical flight installation.
