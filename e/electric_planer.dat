40|$|International audienceWithin the {{framework}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>plane</b> programs, the aircraft industry is facing a higher demand of electric power, fact which involves an increasing use of IGBT modules in aeronautical power converters. Although such modules have been well studied and known in railway and the automotive domains, they will be subjected to stresses and operational cycles specific to the aeronautical environment. Consequently, this requires manufacturers to answer some questions about their lifetime and reliability issues. This work aims to propose, according to aeronautical requirements (EMC, Weight, [...] .), IGBT modules assembling technologies (connections, materials [...] .), which are expected to have the best level of reliability during the aircraft lifetime, and conform to the regulations concerning the use of polluting materials. To tackle this problem, the followed steps will consist in analyzing the failures observed in railway and automobile environments, (wire bonding lift-off, solders and substrates delamination [...] .), in order to propose solutions concerning connection techniques (Fig. 1) and materials more appropriate to aeronautical operational environment. Literature search followed by mechanical tests will make it possible to choose and identify the materials constitutive laws and failures criteria (solder, base plate, substrates and metallization). These laws will be used in a finite element model, in order to simulate the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the various configurations of IGBT modules, and then perform a design of experiments analysis based on thermals resistances, maximal stresses and strain energy densities for both thermal and power cycling loading. By these numerical comparisons, the best assembling configurations for each profile will be identified. They will then be manufactured and tested during thermal and power cycling, in order to verify the predicted thermo-mechanical performances and failures criteria...|$|R
