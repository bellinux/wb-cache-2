[...] In Boston, Coffman recalled that the newspaper headlines reported that [...] "the young upstart from the cotton fields of Alabama would pitch against the incomparable Lefty Grove." [...] On the day of his debut, Cochrane came into the clubhouse and announced that Eldon Auker would start the game. [...] Coffman complained to Cochrane, [...] "But Mickey you told me I would pitch today, and I'm prepared to do just that." [...] Cochrane responded, [...] "I don't care what I told you. [...] Go out there and bring somebody in like Schoolboy Rowe. Grove's pitching today and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off to a better start...you know we never score many runs off him." [...] Coffman replied, [...] "Well let me tell you Mickey they won't score many runs off of me, either." [...] Coffman recalled that this was all Cochrane was waiting for, and he slammed his fist on a table and exclaimed, [...] "OK kid I'll catch you."
