5000|$|In {{the summer}} before the 2012-13 season, Tuktamysheva {{sustained}} a knee injury. She was assigned to 2012 Skate Canada and the 2012 Trophée Éric Bompard, entering both events as the defending champion. In October, Mishin said that her participation at Skate Canada was uncertain due to injury and growth issues. Tuktamysheva did compete in Skate Canada, placing sixth in the short program and third in the free skate. She finished 4th overall with a total score of 168.00, just 0.04 less than bronze medalist Kanako Murakami. At the 2012 Trophée Éric Bompard, Tuktamysheva was third in the short program and second in the free skate. She obtained a personal best free skating score, 121.36 points, and won the silver medal ahead of teammate Yulia Lipnitskaya. Tuktamysheva qualified for the Grand Prix Final in Sochi, Russia, where she was 5th in the short program and 2nd in the long, finishing 5th overall. At the 2013 Russian Championships, also held in Sochi, she placed first in the short program but fell ill with a cold before the free skate. Mishin initially indicated that she would withdraw but later she and her team decided she would compete. Tuktamysheva said, [...] "I might find myself in an even worse situation in the future. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to handle it, {{so we decided to}} skate."

5000|$|Hellboy, {{with his}} new love Alice Monaghan, visits the church of a friend, an English parish priest named Bill, who {{confirms}} that Hellboy's promised army of [...] "the noble dead of Britain" [...] are indeed leaving their graves. They watch Bill showing three empty stone caskets to a puzzled police officer; Hellboy hears the occupant of a fourth, undisturbed, tomb (reputed that of a traitor) begging Hellboy's pardon as England's king. Bill had seen the other three knights leaving. Hellboy thanks Bill but decides not to tell him of the coming war ("Bad enough you and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that"). Hellboy has quit drinking and rejects Bill's invitation to join him at the pub, complaining to Alice of the role alcohol has played in his trials since departing from the BPRD. Hellboy and Alice leave the town in a [...] "crappy rental car" [...] with the sword Excalibur in its back seat wrapped in a towel. As they drive they comment on the ill omen of a tall bell-ringing homeless man standing by the road with a [...] "The End is Nigh" [...] placard, and they discuss the problem of where Hellboy is to meet the army of reanimated British knights that according to Morgan le Fay he must lead against the apocalyptic army of Nimue. They are surprised by a giant beast warrior elaborately helmeted and armored in some copper-colored metal, wielding a large spear and running at them down the road. The warrior punches their car {{off the road and}} down a wooded slope. After frantically checking that she is unhurt, Hellboy leaves Alice in the upended car to fight the warrior who while fighting announces himself the champion of Nimue, who has just murdered Queen Mab and (we see in flashback) the unnamed elfin retainer of the Dagda who had advised Hellboy during the Hellboy: Box Full of Evil storyline. While they fight, the Gruagach is fleeing the growing storm elsewhere in the countryside and trips over the grave of Merlin, whose image he begs for mercy, eliciting the reply, [...] "No mercy for you, pig." ...|$|E

40|$|All living systems {{share many}} {{properties}} including hardly predictable behaviours, {{due to the}} differences between individuals and the chaos in natural environments. The reductionist approach to the interpretation of these phenomena suffers from the oversimplification of the factors involved in the quest of universal “scientific” explanations. The validation of scientific paradigms {{is based on the}} consensus of leading groups that decide what is true and what is not. That means that all events - not only conflicting opinions but also conflicting raw data - not fitting with the scientific official truth were never published, and that supported indirectly the correctness of the experts’ choice. With the advent of Web 2. 0 and the freedom of publishing, the number of these not fitting events has dramatically increased. Yesterday, data were supplied to the reader with the interpretation. Now the reader has to afford in each field a huge amount of data and opinions. Extracting from the garbage the information you need requires a strategy. Strategy is a science by itself. In the specific case of knowledge {{the first step is to}} define knowledge. The aim of life sciences, medicine, social sciences is to modify the reality when it is no longer sustainable, whatever it could mean in every single situation. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how my system works to modify it. Knowledge is the information that allows me to succeed in my tasks. Tasks must have an assessable target. All information useful and therefore processed to attain the target will be “targeted knowledge”. Information can be selected on the basis of their congruence with the rules internal to the system. In Web 2. 0 we found proper tools to test this approach. We implemented a web application - whose aim is an easier identification of the molecular basis of the diseases - structured in Rules, Reports, Items, Pathways and Tools referring and linking one another. The use of tags allows and fosters a free and personal use of information to create original knowledge. Users can follow and open innovative paths each time answering a different question, re-combining the fitting information. Our application is an example of advanced Problem Solving: the patient as a whole, not as a single symptom, has to be understood as a part of the living world (Gaia, with its rules) whose components (Items, Pathways) are described in their multiple roles and connections. The Web allows easy access to information, the program allows the network creation, the Rules drive the selection of the information and become more and more stable the more they evolutionary adapt to the reality.

40|$|Hoje em dia é muito normal ouvir dos alunos afirmações como: a disciplina de Matemática é um “bicho-de-sete-cabeças”, complicada e onde apenas se aprendem temas que não se sabe para que é que servem. Muitos até se questionam, “para que é que eu tenho de saber isto?” Esta é a ideia que muitos alunos portugueses têm da disciplina de Matemática. Nesse sentido, e de forma a contrariar esse tipo de pensamentos nos alunos, e mostrar que realmente a Matemática pode ser muito útil na resolução de problemas reais, este trabalho incide sobre a Programação Linear no Ensino Secundário. É um tema interessante, rico e extremamente útil na resolução de problemas onde o planeamento, a gestão de recursos e a tomada de decisões são factores importantíssimos para se conseguir solucionar problemas reais com bastante sucesso. Assim, este trabalho visa averiguar se os conhecimentos que os alunos adquiriram nas aulas de Matemática sobre o tema de Programação Linear se reflectem nos seus resultados quando confrontados com tarefas semelhantes às que eles resolveram nas aulas. Neste estudo de caso intervêm alunos de duas turmas de Matemática A do 11 º ano de escolaridade que frequentam a Escola Secundária Homem Cristo, em Aveiro, e das quais foram seleccionados sete elementos que participam no estudo em causa. Os dados foram recolhidos ao longo das três aulas dedicadas a este tema sob a forma de grelhas de observação naturalista, preenchidas individualmente por três observadores e ainda através da aplicação de uma tarefa de Programação Linear nos alunos. Os resultados revelam que a Programação Linear é um dos temas que os alunos mais gostam. No entanto, e apesar de quase todos saberem como chegar à solução óptima, existe um grande número de alunos que tem dificuldades em interpretar enunciados deste tipo de tarefas, e de apresentar todas as soluções óptimas em tarefas que tenham mais do que uma solução óptima. Currently, {{it is very}} usual {{to listen}} to {{statements}} from students such as: the subject of Mathematics is “rocket science”, complicated and you learn things you don´t know what to use for. Many even ask themselves “why do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> this?” This is the idea many Portuguese students have {{on the subject of}} Mathematics. Therefore, and trying to counter this line of thinking by students, and to show that, actually, Mathematics can be very useful on the resolution of real problems, this work focuses on Linear Programming in high school context. It is an interesting theme, rich and extremely useful in the resolution of problems where planning, managing resources and decision making are very important factors in the successful resolution of real life problems. This work aims at checking whether the knowledge that students have acquired in mathematics classes on the subject of linear programming are reflected in their results when faced with similar tasks they solved in class. This study case involved students from two Mathematics A classes from the 11 th grade of the Escola Secundária Homem Cristo, in Aveiro. Seven students were selected to participate in the referred study. Data was collected throughout three classes dedicated to the subject using naturalistic observation grids, individually filled by three observers and also by assigning the students a Linear programming task. Results show that Linear Programming is one of the themes preferred by students. However, and in spite of almost all of them know how to reach the optimal solution, there is a great number of them showing difficulties in the interpretation of these tasks’ statements and also in presenting all the optimal solutions in tasks with more than one optimal solution.
