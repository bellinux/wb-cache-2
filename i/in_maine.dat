5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this country's history, most American Indian tribes have been subject to federal authority and jurisdiction. <b>In</b> <b>Maine,</b> however, indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state. This unique arrangement shaped tribal life <b>in</b> <b>Maine,</b> and proved to be a crucial issue in the development and resolution of the tribe's land claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{impact from}} a Nor'easter {{just one day}} before Daisy hit, and Hurricane Daisy, caused severe flooding <b>in</b> <b>Maine,</b> when rain fell for 65consecutive hours in some locations.

5|$|Gloria's {{high winds}} downed {{numerous}} trees across New England, causing minor to moderate damage. In the region, Connecticut received {{the worst of}} the hurricane, where tree and structural damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. New Hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding. <b>In</b> <b>Maine,</b> damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees. High winds across New England resulted in significant power outages, leaving 250,000 <b>in</b> <b>Maine.</b> In all, seven deaths occurred in New England, many of which occurred from falling tree limbs.|$|E

He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans <b>in</b> <b>Maine,</b> sometime around 1078.

In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles blown off <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England.

5|$|Another ice {{famine in}} 1870 then {{impacted}} both Boston and the Hudson, with a further famine following in 1880; {{as a result}} entrepreneurs descended on the Kennebec River <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> as an alternative source. The Kennebec, along with the Penboscot and Sheepscot, was widely opened up for the ice industry, becoming an important source, particularly in warm winters, {{for the rest of}} the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Despite this {{emerging}} competition, natural ice remained vital to North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to continue to expand. Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along the Hudson River and Maine alone, the Hudson having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> to meet the demand, and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 saw another ice famine hit the east: the Hudson harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations <b>in</b> <b>Maine,</b> where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Maine,</b> 20 {{counties}} were declared {{states of}} emergency. After the storm, Southern New England Telephone sent {{a crew of}} 100workers in 50trucks to Maine to assist in restoring power. Power was quickly restored, and in some places the outages were less severe than during Carol. For only {{the third time in}} its history, the Portland Evening Express was not delivered due to the storm. Most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm, although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair. There was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles <b>in</b> <b>Maine</b> due to washed out roads. Affecting densely populated portions of the state, Edna struck the day before the governor race between Republican Burton M. Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed turnout {{as a result of the}} storm would benefit Muskie, in a state where no Democrat had won governorship since 1934. Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower turnout than 1950, likely due to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican turnout.|$|E
