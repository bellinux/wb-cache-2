Early in the PRC era, Uyghurs may have a choice from two separate secular school systems, one conducted in their own language, and one offering instructions only in Chinese. [...] Many Uyghurs link the preservation of their cultural and religious identity with the language of instruction in schools and therefore prefer the Uyghur language school. [...] However, from the mid-1980s onward, the Chinese government began to reduce teaching in Uyghur, and starting mid-1990s also began to merge some schools from the two systems. By 2002 Xinjiang University, originally a bilingual institution, had ceased offering courses in the Uyghur language. From 2004 onward, the government policy is that classes should be conducted in Chinese as much as possible, and in some selected regions, instruction in Chinese began in the first grade.The level of education attainment among Uyghurs is generally {{lower than that of}} the Han Chinese; {{this may be due to}} the cost of education, the lack of proficiency in the Chinese language (now the main medium of instruction) among many Uyghurs, and a poorer <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> for Uyghur graduates.

A quantitative research design was used in which self administered questionnaires were distributed to respondents. A purposive sampling procedure was utilised. The data was subjected to a number of statistical analyses including one way ANOVA and T-test of independent samples. Results indicated that final Accounting and Pharmacy students reported positive perceptions about their <b>employment</b> <b>prospects</b> than final year sociology students. As hypothesised, female final year students were significantly more confident than male final year students about <b>employment</b> <b>prospects.</b> Also, black final year students were found to be significantly more confident than their white final year counterparts (non-beneficiaries of employment policies) about their <b>employment</b> <b>prospects.</b> It is concluded that differences regarding <b>employment</b> <b>prospects</b> among final year students can be accounted for by factors such as gender, field of study, race and whether or not one is a beneficiary of the SA government’s affirmative employment policies...|$|R

This reflects a variety of factors, including the relatively high proportion of young people leaving school without a basic education qualification, {{the fact that}} skills acquired in initial education are not always well adapted to labour market requirements, as well as general labour market conditions and problems in the functioning of labour markets. The paper highlights the contrasting trends in youth labour market performance {{over the past decade}} using a wide range of indicators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the incentives regarding the education decisions, resulting from a minimum wage over the period 2005 - 2014. The question is investigated by comparing {{the changes in the}} wage dispersion and upper secondary graduation rate in 17 OECD countries. And then, by comparing the changes in the bites of the minimum wage and educational attainment for upper secondary students in 11 OECD countries, where minimum wages are regulated by law. The majority of previous research seem to point out a negative educational effect of minimum wages. However, this paper finds no evidence that increasing the minimum wage can decrease the high school graduation rate. A possible explanation is that the correlation between the higher <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> and educational attainment can create incentives for young individuals to undergo education.

It also has important implications regarding geographical mobility and labor market commitment. In this paper we examine the determinants of age at first home ownership for the Spanish population using the Spanish Socio-demographic Survey. Some interesting results are as follows. (1) Age at becoming a owner-occupier is closely related with age at marriage. More than 50 % of the purchases of first house coincide with the time of marriage. (2) The hazard rate of homeownership among men is 3 - 4 times higher during an employed period than during an unemployed period, and within an employed period the rate is about twice higher if the job is a permanent one than if it is a temporary one. (3) An implication for the future is that given other things equal a better <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> along with an increasing number of two-earner couples will shorten the age at homeownership and thus increase the proportion of homeownership...|$|E
40|$|This study explores how technological, organizational, and {{managerial}} changes affected the labor-market status of older male manufacturing workers in {{early twentieth century}} America. Industrial characteristics that were favorably related to the labor-market status of older industrial workers include: higher labor productivity, less capital- and material-intensive production, a shorter workday, lower intensity of work, greater job flexibility, and more formalized employment relationship. Technical innovations that improved productivity often negatively affected {{the quality of the}} work environment of older workers. These results suggest that the technological transformations in the Industrial Era brought mixed consequences to the labor-market status of older workers. On one hand, technical and organizational modifications improved the elderly workers’ <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> by raising labor productivity, diminishing hours of work, and formalizing employment relations. On the other hand, some types of technical innovations, which are characterized by additional requirements for physical strength, mental agility, and ability to acquire new skills, forced older workers out of their jobs. Since the pace and nature of technical change considerably differed across industries, and possibly across firms within the same industry, the labor-market experiences of individual older workers should have been highly heterogeneous. ...|$|E
40|$|Several countries, {{including}} Malaysia, {{have set}} a long term target of establishing a more educated workforce. This thrust on the massification of higher education {{has resulted in a}} new problem-graduate unemployment. The growing problem of graduate unemployment in Malaysia is widely debated in the media and blogs. The Higher Education Ministry, in its Graduate Tracer Study Report 2011, reported that 24 per cent of them have not found a job after six months of graduating. The employment scenario of the urban planning graduates has changed over the years from catering the needs of the public sector, to catering the needs of the private sector and to fulfilling the need of the One Stop Centre or the OSC. The advent of the liberalization of urban planning services challenges urban planning schools in Malaysia to produce planners not only to cater for local needs but also with the capability of exporting their skills and services internationally. Given the diverse scope of urban planning it is a paradox that graduates of urban planning should converge on the conventional urban planning organizations for employment. The paper will highlight some preliminary findings on the <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> of urban planning graduates in the immediate future and the possibility of diversifying employment opportunities of urban planning graduates...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{justifications}} {{provided for}} early retirement policies {{in developed countries}} {{is the idea that}} such policies can facilitate access to the labor market for younger people and help lower global unemployment. But many questions remain on the true effect on young workers of these policies. The objective of the present paper is to study the long term relationship between labor force participation of the old and unemployment of the young in France {{since the beginning of the}} 1970 s. Establishing causal relationship of the reduction of labor force participation of the old on <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> of the young is a challenging work. Evidence of the correlation between youth labor market outcomes and older worker’s labor force participation plead more in favor of a positive association between younger and older workers ’ employment. An increase in the older workers’ participation is indeed correlated with an increase in the employment rate of young workers and a decrease in their unemployment rate. Even controlling for the economic cycle, this positive association remains – albeit less robustly. These correlations, based on times series, are not however evidence of causal relationship between younger and older workers ’ employment. We then use an index summarizing the intensity of policies aiming at removing older workers from the labor market, based on Social Security wealth. The effect of the wealth index on youth labor market outcomes is always significant, whatever the set of the control variables we use and with...|$|E
40|$|Aim/Purpose: The uptake of {{university}} by regional students has been problematic for various reasons. This paper discusses a program, initiated by a South Australian regional university campus, aimed at attracting regional students into higher education. Background: A qualitative descriptive approach to study {{was used to}} determine the value of the program on participating students and school staff. Year 10 students from Roxby Downs, Port Augusta and Port Lincoln high schools were invited to participate in a two-day regionally-focussed school-university engagement program that linked students with the university campus and local employers. Methodology: A survey was administered to determine the impact of the program. Perceptions about the program by school staff were gathered using a modified One-Minute Harvard questionnaire. While 38 Year 10 students and 5 school staff members participated, 37 students and 3 staff evaluated the program. Findings: The findings revealed {{that the majority of the}} students would like to attend university, but financial and social issues were important barriers. The students learned about the regional university, what it can offer in terms of programs and support, and the <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> following university. The school staff benefited by developing a closer relationship with students and becoming better informed about the regional university. Recommendation for Practitioners: One way by which university uptake may be increased is to provide similar immersion programs featuring engagement with employers, our recommendation to other regional universities.

40|$|Real Estate Management (REM) {{practice}} is being increasingly challenged, {{as a result}} of the economic recession, encroachment of quacks and allied professionals as well as the technological revolution of the contemporary knowledge-based economy. This implies that conformist approach to the REM training might not be enough to guarantee REM students <b>employment</b> <b>prospect.</b> More so, the issue of graduates’ employability in the job market is becoming more competitive in Malaysia. However, entrepreneurship education (EE) introduced in the Malaysian Higher learning institutions with the intention of boosting the employability of the graduates. In spite of the above initiative, impact assessment of the EE is still ambiguous, particularly, in the REM discipline. Hence, an absence of a common assessment framework to evaluate diverse EEs registered in the literature. Therefore, the research aimed to assess perception of the REM students on the impact of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial capacity and self-employment intention and to propose an Objective-based Entrepreneurship Education Assessment Model (OBEEAM). The research employed quantitative research approach and ex-post research design. Hence, purposive sample technique applied to collect data on the sample size of 437 REM students through a cross-sectional survey in the four Malaysian public universities. SPSS 22. 0 and Structural Equation Modeling tools of analysis were used to analyse, data collected, proposed OBEEAM and test of the nine research hypotheses empirically. The findings indicated a positive impact of entrepreneurship education on the perception of REM students’ entrepreneurial capacity and self-employment intention as a career option. Despite, the skills of creativity and innovation in the idea development, risk taking proficiency and practical workshop practice were somewhat weak. Therefore, the need for more practical initiative exercises such as extended entrepreneurship teaching in the core courses and across the years of REM programmes recommended. This could provide the innovation required for the development of dynamic future real estate-entrepreneurs in Malaysia. The research’s novelty is the proposed multidirectional OBEEAM that had integrated the core values and drivers of entrepreneurship teaching and self-employment intention; it could be adopted, adapted and implemented for the assessment of EEs in any academic field of studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{major theme}} {{of this paper is}} aimed to show the adverse effects of {{immigration}} control in a labor market where distinct job segmentation between natives and immigrants exists. Various revisions in immigration policy were often motivated by widespread concern over the alleged adverse impact on native employment from the arrival of immigrants. Facing increasing unemployment pressures, most of governments in the world have a strong tendency to restrict the inflow of immigrant labors for the sake of providing more employment opportunities to native labors. However, it can be shown in this paper that, restricting immigrant labors from competition, will only yield adverse effects to both native labor and immigrant labors, <b>employment</b> <b>prospect</b> for native labors will be worsen rather improved by expulsion of their competitors. In the case of Chinese urban labor market, my first argument for this point {{comes from the fact that}} native labors and immigrant labors are, much often if not always, located in two segmented parts of job market where little labor mobility is occurring. Withdraw of immigrant labors will not be much helpful to provide more room for native labors because the rooms vacated are little attraction to them and they would even prefer to wait as unemployed. My second and main argument against immigration control comes from the wage linkages between native labors and immigrants that formally presented by the model in this paper. It is understandable to see, withdraw of immigrant labors in urban informal sectors, besides hurt the production in that sector, will unambiguously push high the wage level in that sectors. Since there exists a positive relationship between the wage level of native workers in formal sectors and that of immigrant workers in urban informal sector, a major finding in the paper, the rise of immigrant worker's wage level will force urban formal firm to pay higher wage to native labors. Intuition behind this point is, using efficiency wage consideration, native workers tend to devote less efforts measured in efficient units when they find the opportunity cost of being caught shirking is reduced, due to the rise of unemployment subsidy which argued to be positively connected with the income level of informal workers. Then, a higher formal wage is provided when the new equilibrium of labor market is reached, but consequently, the demand for native workers is reduced and more urban unemployment incurs. Therefore, ironically, immigration policies that aimed at protecting the employment opportunities of native workers will only make them suffer more loss. And it is further addressed in this paper that, the formation of urban unemployment in today China can be at least partly attributed to the over-priced formal wage, which may argued as a consequence of restricted immigration. And even when the rise of urban unemployment in China is defined as a result of demand deficiency, the demand deficiency itself can be largely attributed to the roots such as low purchasing power of rural residents, undersized urbanization level, and expanding income gap between urban and rural residents, which all can be attributed to the ill-advised immigration control and long-existed urban-rural social and economic segregation...|$|E
