25|$|NBA 2K16 again, for {{the fourth}} time in the series, {{features}} MyTeam mode. MyTeam mode was first introduced in NBA 2K13, and is based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team, and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players build their own custom team, selecting the players, current and past, jerseys, coach, court, and other basketball related things, and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams. Players collect cards that unlock players, playbooks, and other items {{that can be used in}} their team or sold. Players purchase card packs with Virtual Currency (VC) which gives the player random items. Cards have different levels that indicate how good the card is. A player will commonly receive Bronze cards if they purchase cheaper card packs. However, if the player purchases high priced packs, the chances of getting Gold cards are higher. There are also rare cards, such as Amethyst and Diamond cards, that are rarer and better than other cards. The level of a card isn't always the most important factor as the abilities of the actual player, and their rating indicating <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> are, is most often more important. Players can freely customize their team on the fly; players may change the coach, players, jerseys, and anything else at any time. Customization aspects were touted as being the major improvements for the mode.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, {{writing in}} The Telegraph, {{noted that the}} Stuckist's first {{exhibition}} in central London had brought [...] "multiple sales" [...] for leading artists of the movement, and that this {{raised the question of}} <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> were at painting. He observed that [...] "Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan have already taken a punt. Six of Thomson's paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former jailbird who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said [...] "once set {{he was the}} most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power." ...|$|E

5000|$|... a {{farewell}} show last weekend {{was one of}} the most cathartic and genuinely disconcerting live events that this column has seen or heard in 15 years. No caro meos, no undue fusses and no forced sentiment, A House came over like they’ve always come over, always four and often six-square, cocksure and strutted-up like they knew, just knew, <b>how</b> damned <b>good</b> <b>they</b> were and <b>how</b> damned <b>good</b> it was what they were leaving behind them.|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers {{appreciated}} the game's plot. Gamezebo {{said that it}} was an aspect of the game that stood out in a positive way, and pointed out <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> thought the English translation was. Touch Arcade called the story one of the game's strengths, and {{said that it was}} impressive, despite how it had a tendency to be [...] "ham-fisted". Metro appreciated how the game avoided role-playing cliches, such as how it took place in a modern Japan rather than in a [...] "Tolkien-esque fantasy world"; they also liked its [...] "unrestrained style of storytelling". RPGFan found the story to be good and macabre, and surprisingly relevant even in 2014. They disliked that there was very little character development, and how scenes that [...] "traditionally [...] be poignant", especially death scenes, were handled in a nonchalant manner.|$|E
500|$|He died at Down House on 19 April 1882. His {{last words}} {{were to his}} family, telling Emma [...] "I am not the least afraid of death– Remember what a good wife you have been to me– Tell all my {{children}} to remember <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> have been to me", then while she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis [...] "It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you". He had expected {{to be buried in}} St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{warned the}} Beatles about the {{competition}} they would face by {{playing in the}} same club as the Hurricanes by saying, [...] "You'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, and you know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> are. They're going to knock you for six." [...] In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of}} the Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E

I was stunned by <b>how</b> really <b>good</b> <b>they</b> were, {{actually}} as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy... They were totally adventurous and totally innocent, in a certain sense. That's why it was accepted. They would uncover little dark niches that you felt but had never expressed...

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

Bardot have come along way..." [...] A tour of New Zealand was cancelled due to poor ticket sales.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 5–10–1 season. The team was {{considered}} to be superior to the 1979 team that finished the season one game shy of the Super Bowl. With the running game and special teams ineffective, the Buccaneers depended heavily on the pass, and particularly on the big play. Jimmie Giles returned to form, establishing numerous team receiving records. Doug Williams became (with Jim Zorn) the second active quarterback to need only four seasons to reach the 10,000 career passing yards mark. The defense improved over the previous season, a change that McKay attributed to less reliance on blitzes, and a general improvement in speed due to changes in the secondary and the drafting of Hugh Green. Their defense allowed the fewest touchdowns of any NFL team, and was described by opponents as [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "almost awesome". The team was dogged by inconsistent play throughout the season. Players and coaches believed the Buccaneers to be a playoff-worthy team, but a tendency to self-destruct kept them {{on the edge of the}} playoff race, thanks in part to a failure of any other team to take control in either the NFC Central division or the NFC wild-card chase. [...] "We make more mistakes at crucial times than any team I've ever been associated with", said ex-Buckeyes, -Raiders, and -Dolphins safety Neal Colzie. Opposing coach Dick Vermeil said, [...] "I'm not sure they know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>they</b> are", after his Philadelphia Eagles team beat the Buccaneers despite having been outplayed. Nevertheless, the team developed a maturity through the season which allowed them to remain competitive instead of collapsing when behind or when being outplayed.|$|E

50|$|Firms {{can also}} exhibit {{effective}} demands or supplies {{that differ from}} notional demands or supplies. They too can be credit constrained, resulting in their effective demand for goods such as physical capital differing from their notional demand. In addition, {{in a time of}} labor shortage, they are constrained in how much labor they can employ; therefore the amount of <b>goods</b> <b>they</b> choose to supply at any potential goods price - their effective supply of goods - will be less than their notional supply. And if firms are constrained by excess supply in the <b>goods</b> market, limiting <b>how</b> much <b>goods</b> <b>they</b> can sell, then their effective demand for labor will be less than their notional demand for labor.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Filer was now pouring forth {{his nature}} in objurgations and oaths, and brandishing before the culprits--Verena and Ransom--the extreme penalty of the law.

60|$|Really, {{seeing the}} amount we give in charity, the wonder {{is there are}} any poor left. It is a comfort that there are. What should we do without them?

5000|$|The also British Rock n Reel {{gave the}} EP {{a score of}} 4/5, {{considering}} that the title song [...] "has everything that a top-notch Within Temptation track needs" [...] and commenting that the two vocalists execute [...] "every part with perfection". Besides that, the grunt vocals on [...] "Silver Moonlight" [...] and the chorus of [...] "Dog Days" [...] were criticized but containing [...] "potential for the album", only needing some more work.

40|$|Many logic {{programming}} based approaches {{can be used}} to describe and solve combinatorial search problems.

60|$|For a {{long time}} Happy Jack looked and looked. Was it a trap? Somehow he couldn't believe that it was. What would Farmer Brown's boy try to trap him for when they were such good friends?

The company sit for a moment speechless; but Cook recovering first, turns upon the young woman, and requests to know how she dares insult the family, whose bread she eats, by such a dishonest supposition, and whether she thinks that anybody, with a scrap of honour left, could deprive poor servants of their pittance?
