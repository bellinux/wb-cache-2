5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, {{was becoming a}} popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> swimming pool.|$|E

5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York {{and raised}} in East Orange, New Jersey, Beebe left college before obtaining a degree {{in order to work}} at the then newly opened New York Zoological Park, where he was given the duty of caring for the zoo's birds. He quickly {{distinguished}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon also with a series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world's pheasants. These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the Pheasants and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E
5|$|Crosby {{was born}} in the Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on August 7, 1987, to Troy and Trina (née Forbes) Crosby. Crosby's jersey number (87) and 2007 {{contract}} signing ($8.7million per year) reflect his birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour, and has a younger sister, Taylor. His father was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Troy played in the 1985 Memorial Cup and had been drafted 240th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1984, but never played at the NHL level. Growing up, Crosby admired Steve Yzerman and, like his father, was a Canadiens fan. Crosby began playing hockey by <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> basement at the age of two years, shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a longstanding misconception that he was actually practising with the dryer; he learned to skate at three.|$|E
