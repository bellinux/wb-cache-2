500|$|The {{album was}} first {{released}} in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles {{on her hands and}} a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: [...] "The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent." [...] Regarding the album photoshot, Gary Heery recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fishsticks" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The concept for [...] "Fishsticks" [...] began when Parker, fellow co-creator Matt Stone, and actor Bill Hader attended a writers' retreat in Seattle, Washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump. They started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually reminded them of the music video for rapper Kanye West's song [...] "Touch the Sky", in which West himself dresses like Knievel. This led to them picturing a scene with West on a news program, angrily denying reports that he is a fish, shouting [...] "No, I am not a salmon!" [...] During a four-hour ride in a car, Stone and Parker discussed the joke further, and eventually thought of the [...] "fishsticks" [...] joke that featured prominently in the final episode. The duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of the joke back and forth to each other {{for the rest of the}} ride. Stone said, [...] "The van driver we hired was just so bummed because we just <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> about fishsticks, 'You're a gay fish', over and over. We thought it was so funny, and just the fact that he didn't get it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nightfly {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of fully digital recording in popular music. Katz and Fagen had previously experimented with digital recording for Gaucho, which ended up entirely analog. Nichols conducted experiments and found that the digital recordings sounded better than those recorded to magnetic tape. The Nightfly was recorded using 3M's 32-track and four-track recorders. Nichols built a new drum machine, the Wendel II—a sequel to the original Wendel, which was employed for their work on Gaucho. The new model was upgraded from 8 bits to 16 bits, and [...] "plugged straight into the 3M digital machines, so there was no degradation" [...] in sound. Problems with the technology persisted in the beginning, particularly regarding the alignment of the 3M machines. Representatives from 3M had to be called to align the machines, but eventually Fagen and Nichols grew tired of this. Nichols and engineers Jerry Garsszva and Wayne Yurgelun took classes at 3M's Minnesota headquarters, and returned knowing how to align the machines themselves. [...] "I was ready to transfer to analog and give it up on several occasions, but my engineering staff <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> me into it," [...] Fagen remembered. They practiced an early form of [...] "comping" [...] Fagen's vocals—which they called [...] "beat the computer"—wherein he would record multiple takes and the engineers would pick the best lines from each take. On [...] "Walk Between Raindrops", they combined bass parts playing on a keyboard bass and bass guitar. Doubling bass lines would [...] "become common practice on many records," [...] according to writer James Sweet.|$|E
500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: [...] "The General listened for a while, paced back and forth as I <b>kept</b> <b>talking,</b> nodded occasionally, then suddenly stopped and said: That will put the cork in the bottle." ...|$|E

Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I was on my way back to New York with Frank.|$|E

[...] "There was this one producer at Microsoft Game Studios who <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> about how with a few tweaks Barracuda would make an awesome Hydro Thunder sequel. [...] At first we were like, yeah right, that'll happen. [...] But the more we all talked about it, the more it started to make sense." [...] The decision was made to turn the game into a Hydro Thunder sequel and Microsoft Studios acquired the rights to the Hydro Thunder name shortly before publisher Midway Games was bought by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Judge {{once said}} in an {{interview}} that Beavis [...] "is a zero" [...] when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In [...] "Murder Site", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him [...] "Butt-knocker", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's [...] "Nihilism": Butt-Head <b>kept</b> <b>talking</b> about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out of the room to get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed [...] "Bon Jovi rules!".|$|E
2500|$|Clinton was {{conflicted}} {{whether she}} {{wanted to take the}} position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision. While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered. The prospect of her ever becoming Senate Majority Leader seemed dim. A different complication was Bill Clinton; she told Obama: [...] "There's one last thing that's a problem, which is my husband. You've seen what this is like; it will be a circus if I take this job", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries. In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of Bill Clinton's post-presidential activities would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members. There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations. Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, [...] "But, you know, we <b>kept</b> <b>talking.</b> I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So {{at the end of the}} day, when your president asks you to serve, you say yes, if you can." [...] Chief of Protocol of the United States Capricia Penavic Marshall, who had known Clinton since her First Lady days, later confirmed the same rationale: [...] "When asked to serve, she does. And her president asked." ...|$|E
