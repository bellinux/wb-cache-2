40|$|Fiber Bragg Gratings {{is a type}} {{of optical}} sensor used to measure {{temperature}} in many different fields. They have many advantages in relation to standard <b>electric</b> <b>thermometers.</b> The optical fiber and grating is cheap, these optical fiber sensor systems are expensive mainly due to the spectrum analyzer, so it is preferable to minimize the cost while keeping the accuracy as high as possible. By increasing the thermal response of the fiber it is possible to reduce the overall cost of the sensor system. The thermal response can be increased if a material with greater thermal expansion than the fiber is used as coating. Plastic is a coating material with potential due to its availability, low cost and high coefficient of thermal expansion. With 3 Dprinting it is possible to choose from a large range of materials available and customize the functionality of the sensor. In this degree project we examined the functionality of a PLA coated Fiber Bragg Grating sensor where the coating was applied using a 3 D-printer. Our findings shows that these type of sensors could meet the requirements if used within a specific temperature range...|$|R
50|$|The {{regenerative}} furnace {{is the greatest}} single invention of Charles William Siemens, using {{a process known as}} the Siemens-Martin process. The electric pyrometer, which is perhaps the most elegant and original of all William Siemens's inventions, is also the link which connects his electrical with his metallurgical researches. Siemens pursued two major themes in his inventive efforts, one based upon the science of heat, the other based upon the science of electricity; and the <b>electric</b> <b>thermometer</b> was, as it were, a delicate cross-coupling which connected both. Imbued with the idea of regeneration, and seeking in nature for that thrift of power which he, as an inventor, had always aimed at, Siemens suggested a hypothesis on which the sun conserves its heat by a circulation of its fuel in space, afterwards reprinting the controversy in a volume, On the Conservation of Solar Energy.|$|E
40|$|Correlations between intraarticular {{changes and}} local {{findings}} and skin surface and intraarticular temperature following Phenolcamphor injection were studied {{to assure the}} possibilities of anticipating its effects and courses following Phenolcamphor injection by measurement of temperature. Phenolcamphor were injected into knee joints of three groups of normal rabbits in which 0. 25 cc and 0. 5 cc of Phenolcamphor, and mixed solution of 0. 25 cc of Phenolcamphor and 0. 25 cc of water as control were given. Temperature was measured with <b>electric</b> <b>thermometer.</b> 1) Close relationship were found between intraarticular changes and local findings, and skin surface and intraarticular temperature following intraarticular injection of Phenolcamphor. Temperature rose with increase of local inflammatory signs and falls with its regression and stabilized {{after two or three}} weeks. 2) Parallel correlation was found between skin surface and intraarticular temperature with a little high level in the latter. 3) No difference in changes of temperature was found in different amount of injected Phenolcamphor, though the Peak of temperature rise was noted slightly later {{in the case of a}} small amount of injected material than in the large amount. 4) It is of significance for observation of effects and course of Phenolcamphor injection to measure skin surface and intraarticular temperature. However, it is not feasible to measure frequently intraarticular temperature and also it is hardly acceptable to inject procaine into joint for the relief of pain in measurement of intraarticular temperature. It is not applicable to clinical use, hence measurement of skin temperature should be used as substitute for it...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of fluctuations in {{temperature and humidity}} are needed for determination of the surface evaporation rate and the air-sea sensible heat flux using either the eddy correlation or inertial dissipation method for flux calculations. These measurements are difficult to make over the ocean, and are subject to large errors when sensors are exposed to marine air containing spray droplets. All currently available commercial measurement devices for atmospheric humidity require frequent maintenance. Included in {{the objectives of the}} Humidity Exchange over the Sea program were testing and comparison of sensors used for measuring both the fluctuating and mean humidity in the marine atmosphere at high wind speeds and development of techniques for the protection of these sensors against contamination by oceanic aerosols. These sensors and droplet removal techniques are described and comparisons between measurements from several different systems are discussed in this paper. To accomplish these goals, participating groups devised and tested three methods of removing sea spray from the sample airstream. The best performance was given by a rotating semen device, the “spray Ringer. ” Several high-frequency temperature and humidity instruments, based on different physical principles, were used in the collaborative field experiment. Temperature and humidity fluctuations were measured with sufficient accuracy inside the spray removal devices using Lyman-α hygrometers and a fast thermocouple psychrometer. Comparison of several types of psychrometers (using <b>electric</b> <b>thermometers)</b> and a Rotronic MP- 100 humidity sensor for measuring the mean humidity illustrated the hysteresis of the Rotronic MP- 100 device after periods of high relative humidity. Confidence in the readings of the electronic psychrometer was established by in situ calibration with repeated and careful readings of ordinary hand-held Assman psychrometers (based on mercury thermometers). Electronic psychrometer employing platinum resistance thermometers perform very well...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the geographical distribution of surface air temperatures in Osaka City, moving observations by two automobiles with thermister <b>electric</b> <b>thermometers</b> were made from 20 : 00 on to 22 : 00 on Feb. 14, 1958. Two observation routes crossing {{each other at the}} heart of the city were taken : route A (north-south route, 20 km) and the route B (east-west route, 18 km). The temperatures at each observation point along the route were measured twice both on the way forth and back. The observed temperatures at different times were adjusted to those at 21 : 00 on each observation point, referring to the temperature records of continuous observation at the Osaka University of Liberal Arts Education, located almost at the center of the City. Using the arithmetical means of the two adjusted values for each point, the author made profiles of the temperature along the routes. During the observation period the north wind was blowing with the velocity ranging from 0. 9 to 4. 2 msec. The following were concluded; 1) High temperatures (about 5. 0 ℃) were observed at Sennichimae, an amusement center in the South, and at Umeda, a bustling terminal in the North. These areas are densely builtup and have the heaviest motor traffic. 2) Low temperatures (about 2. 0 ℃) were observed at the northern and the eastern extremities of the routes. These areas show typical rural landscapes and are far from the seacoast. 3) The western part of the route B shows higher temperatures (about 4. 0 ℃ or more) influenced by the neighbouring sea. 4) The southern part of the route A shows less temperature than the northern and the eastern suburbs, because this area has less rural landscapes and is fairly influenced by the sea lying sea lying near to the west...|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} effect of industries growth is their waste that generates contamination to environment. Cr in water above the concentration’s limit is {{one kind of}} the waste. The adsortion of Cr from aqueous solutions by algae biomass was studied. The aim {{of this research was}} to find the exact adsorption isotherm model to predict the single system adsorption by algae biomass. The batch sorption experiments was carried out in a stirred reactor equipped by <b>thermometer,</b> <b>electric</b> heater and condensor. Weighted amounts (15 to 20 g) of algae were intoduced into the reactor, to which 250 ml of Cr solution were added. The amount of Cr accumulated on algae was calculated as the difference between rhe amount present in control experiments and that remaining in solution after equilibrium with biomass After the equlibrium was attained, the Cr concentration was analized using AAS. The variables, observed in this experiment were the temperature and pH of the solution. Three adsorption isotherm models, namely Henry isotherm model, Freundlich isotherm model and Langmuir isotherm model were fitted to the experimental data. The result got Freundlich isotherm model which had least average relative error. Keywords : Algae,Adsorption, Isotherm mode...|$|R
40|$|The methods {{which are}} {{recommended}} in the handbook take into consideration, {{for the first}} time, the dependence of the physical, thermal and mechanical properties of frozen soils on their cryogenic structure. Frozen soils strongly manifest anisotropy and the heterogeneous distribution of properties which are usually evaluated as the averaged values of the characteristics. The completeness of the document cannot be overemphasized. A section on basic concepts and nomenclature of frozen soils, in particular {{the nature of the}} cryogenic structure, precedes the main chapters. Notes are also provided for the selection, packing, transportation and storage of samples of frozen soil. The main physical properties of frozen soils which are the total moisture content, ice content and specific weight depend on the cryogenic structure of the soil and special attention should be given to indications of these properties. The thermal properties for which test methods of determintion are given are heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, freezing point depression of saline soils and the construction and calibration of thermocouples, <b>electric</b> heaters and <b>thermometers.</b> The mechanical properties for which test methods are given include compressibility of frozen and thawed soils, resistance to normal pressure, long term value of cohesion, uniaxial compression, resistance to shear of both frozen and thawed soils, tangential heaving forces and finally viscosity of ice inclusions.

40|$|It {{was during}} the fifth Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition of 1960 - 1962 that the glaciological section was {{established}} officially. In spite {{of the absence of}} a glaciological section prior to this time, many scientists attempted studies on glaciological problems since the first expedition. Various studies were made on such problems as the evaporation of snow blocks, the formation of puddles, the dynamics of blowing snow, the formation of sastrugi, the flow of glacier, the orientation of crystal axis of glacier ice, etc. The results have been published previously. The studies which involved a tremendous amount of effort were the measurements of thickness of the continental ice sheet {{in the vicinity of the}} Mizuho Plateau which is located to the south of Syowa Station. The third and fourth expeditions made these measurements by seismic sounding and the fifth expedition made their measurements with the aid of a gravimeter. The fifth expedition built a small selfrecording observatory at about thirty kilometers to the southeast of Syowa Station. At this place, the temperature of the snow from the surface to a nine meter depth was measured by copper-constantan thermocouples taking the temperature of snow at the ten meter depth as a standard. Recording was made once a day throughout the year. The temperature of snow at a ten meter depth was measured by an <b>electric</b> resistance <b>thermometer</b> six times that year. The mean temperature was - 16. 6 ℃. As a part of studies on sea ice in the neighbourhood of Syowa Station, a growth of sea ice was observed on the leeward side of the iceberg where no snow was deposited. The results on sea ice were compared with the accumulated temperature below the freezing point of the sea water. Accumulation of snow on sea ice was observed by stakes set up on a line twelve hundred meters in length. The vertical pit walls in the previously deposited snow were dug in August and December, and the density, temperature and hardness at each depth were measured. The vertical sections of some sastrugi were made and the pattern of accumulation layers was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor body {{temperature}} in athletes {{at risk of}} hyperthermia is essential in all species. Currently, the only commonly accepted temperature monitoring site in dogs is the rectum. This is impractical in field situations as it takes time, requires additional handlers to restrain the dog and is not tolerated by all animals. Tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) monitoring may provide a rapid measure of body temperature to facilitate identification of heat stress and heat stroke in canine athletes. In human studies, TMT diverges from rectal temperature (RT) as body temperature increases during exercise induced hyperthermia so is not recommended for monitoring human athletes. If the same divergence occurs in dogs, TMT may not be suitable for use when monitoring the temperature of canine athletes. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine if TMT diverged from RT following exercise in healthy dogs. 24 healthy dogs were recruited to the study. Body temperature was measured using a veterinary auricular infrared thermometer (VetTemp) to record tympanic membrane temperature and an <b>electric</b> predictive rectal <b>thermometer.</b> Temperatures were recorded pre and post exercise in a non-clinical setting, familiar to the dogs. The mixed model approach showed that exercise had no effect on the difference between RT and TMT (F(1, 201) = 0. 026, P= 0. 872). The overall mean difference of RT minus TMT was 0. 39 °C (n = 116). 68. 4 % of readings fell within the accepted 0. 5 °C difference in temperature recording method. In line with previously reported TMT to RT comparison studies in dogs, this study found that TMT measured consistently lower than RT. Using a correction factor of 0. 4 °C minimised the difference. The hypothesis that dogs would show greater differences between TMT and RT following exercise was not supported, suggesting that TMT could be used to monitor body temperature in exercising dogs where RT is not possible...|$|R
