40|$|Abstract — An {{analysis}} and modeling approach of an electromechanical harvesting {{system based on}} a brushless generator (BLG) is presented and evaluated. The approach {{is based on an}} electrical analog of the mechanical components and was verified by modeling a knee joint harvesting system. Good agreement was found between the model predictions and the experimental results. New harvesting strategies based on energy storage by the BLG moment of inertia are suggested and examined.

In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are <b>emulated</b> in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
