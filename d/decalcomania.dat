25|$|The {{movement}} in the mid-1920s was characterized by meetings in cafes where the Surrealists played collaborative drawing games, discussed the theories of Surrealism, and developed {{a variety of techniques}} such as automatic drawing. Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and automatism. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as frottage and <b>decalcomania.</b>|$|E

Intended for young children who might have difficulty pronouncing or reading the word [...] "decalcomanias", these transfers were marketed as [...] "Cockamamies", a deliberate mispronunciation of that word. The term [...] "cockamamy" [...] or [...] "cockamamie" [...] has entered the English language with various slang meanings, usually denoting something that is wacky, strange or unusual.|$|R
25|$|When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly {{embraced by}} a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the {{writings}} of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and <b>decalcomania,</b> the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques {{through the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E
6000|$|Many {{people say}} that for a male person, bric-a-brac hunting is about as robust a {{business}} as making doll-clothes, or decorating Japanese pots with <b>decalcomania</b> butterflies would be, and these people fling mud at the elegant Englishman, Byng, who {{wrote a book called}} THE BRIC-A-BRAC HUNTER, and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose to call [...] "his despicable trifles"; and for [...] "gushing" [...] over these trifles; and for exhibiting his [...] "deep infantile delight" [...] in what they call his [...] "tuppenny collection of beggarly trivialities"; and for beginning his book with a picture of himself seated, in a [...] "sappy, self-complacent attitude, {{in the midst of his}} poor little ridiculous bric-a-brac junk shop." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Decalcomania,</b> {{from the}} French décalcomanie, is a {{decorative}} technique by which engravings and prints may {{be transferred to}} pottery or other materials. Today, the shortened version is [...] "Decal".|$|E
5000|$|It {{was invented}} in England about 1750 and {{imported}} into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention {{has been attributed to}} Simon François Ravenet, an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called [...] "décalquer" [...] (derived from French papier de calque, [...] "tracing paper"). The first known use of the French term décalcomanie, in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Eleanor's Victory (1863), was followed by the English <b>decalcomania</b> in an 1865 trade show catalog (The Tenth Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By c 1875 <b>decalcomania</b> designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to porcelain, an extension of transfer-printing, which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The <b>decalcomania</b> was applied over an already-glazed surface and re-fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Do Disturb was {{released}} in two editions. The standard version cover of the mini-album depicts Jung in black-and-white monochrome, contrasted against colorful tropical plants {{in the form of}} <b>decalcomania</b> in order to emit a summery aura. Not part of the original design, the <b>decalcomania</b> was inspired by a trip Jung took to Hawaii, where he [...] "fell in love with the place". Shot in the Hongdae, Seoul, Jung collaborated with a photographer of Arena Korea magazine for the album photography. It showcases him wearing a colored, patterned Hawaiian shirt. Formed {{in the shape of a}} book, its contents include a 96-page photo booklet, a poster, and one random selfie photo card.|$|E
50|$|He {{took up the}} Russian-invented {{technique}} of <b>decalcomania</b> in 1936, using gouache spread thinly {{on a sheet of}} paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas.|$|E
50|$|After 1820 the {{manufacturing}} of hand colored printed slides started, often {{making use of}} <b>decalcomania</b> transfers. Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.|$|E
50|$|The {{next year}} he collaborated with Joan Miró on designs for Sergei Diaghilev. With Miró's help, Ernst pioneered grattage, in which he troweled pigment from his canvases. He also {{explored}} with the technique of <b>decalcomania,</b> which involves pressing paint between two surfaces.|$|E

50|$|<b>Decalcomania</b> is {{a process}} of {{spreading}} thick paint upon a canvas then - while it is still wet - covering it with further material such as paper or aluminium foil. This covering is then removed (again before the paint dries), and the resultant paint pattern becomes the basis of the finished painting. The technique was much employed by artists such as Max Ernst.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Florence. Self-taught, he made his debut in 1968 with his first one-man show at the Galleria Inquadrature in Florence. During the 1970s he began an intense {{research}} on the free juxtaposition of objects and figures within a fantastical and suspended atmosphere, influenced by Neo-Dada and Pop Art research. During those years he experimented with various pictorial techniques, combining fluorescent colours, <b>decalcomania,</b> collage and photographic transpositions. Between 1972 and 1973 he exhibited in the main private galleries in Florence, presented by his friend the poet Alfonso Gatto.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, after {{relocating}} to Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, André Rousseau rounded Rousseau Metal inc., {{and later}} Moto-Kometik in the 1970s. He was President of Rousseau Metal inc., {{until his retirement}} in 1985 and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Mr. Simon-Pierre Paré. From 1950 to 1960 Mr. Rousseau also was a Director of Paul Dumont Ltd. in Saint-Romuald, Quebec and of Artistic <b>Decalcomania</b> in Montreal. Mr. Rousseau was a great defender of private enterprise and assisted in the financial rescue of many enterprises in Quebec headed for Bankruptcy, including Moto-Kometik which was consolidated with Rousseau Metal Inc.|$|E

5000|$|James Clifford {{was born}} in Muswellbrook in 1936 and in the sixties moved to Sydney where he studied with Desiderius Orban and {{exhibited}} at Watters Gallery. He worked in various styles and became distinctive early on, combining Hard-edge painting with landscape and seascape painting in kaleidoscopic perspectives, tropical landscapes, Art Nouveau borders and the surrealism of Gordon Onslow Ford, later incorporating collage, occasionally text art, <b>Decalcomania.</b> Clifford was openly same sex attracted however he {{described himself as a}} homophobic homosexual. His paintings of the human figure were usually male homoerotic nudes. His late paintings were Lyrical abstraction and have been compared to Ralph Balson's matter paintings of the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, [...] "Max Ernst: A Retrospective" [...] {{opened at}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art and {{included}} works such as Celebes (1921), Ubu Imperator (1923), and Fireside Angel (1937), {{which is one of}} the few definitively political pieces and is sub-titled The Triumph of Surrealism depicting a raging bird-like creature that symbolizes the wave of fascism that enveloped Europe. The exhibition also includes Ernst's works that experiment with free association writing and the techniques of frottage, created from a rubbing from a textured surface; grattage, involving scratching at the surface of a painting; and <b>decalcomania,</b> which involves altering a wet painting by pressing a second surface against it and taking it away.|$|E
5000|$|The highly {{respected}} painter Richard Larter was {{an admirer of}} Clifford's skill in Marbleizing and <b>Decalcomania.</b> Larter wrote of Clifford's marbled paintings: [...] "These works ranged from abstracts (like the ones in this exhibition) to paintings where waves, sandy beaches, cliffs, hills, swirling clouds in blue skies, expanses of seas and harbours with waves breaking and great sunsets were suggested. The paint used was mainly household enamel paint, the colours which ran into each other were usually cream, silver, white, ultramarine blue, pale blue, yellow, red and green. What was truly remarkable was that if you truly looked at the paintwork {{there was no sign}} of any brushwork. It was as if the paint had been magically placed on the canvas. Yet how spendidly had that paint been placed; one could discern white top waves breaking, sanded beaches, cliff faces, whole headlands with rolling hills beyond and turbulent water, not just breakers".|$|E
5000|$|Gleeson's themes {{generally}} {{delved into}} the subconscious using literary, mythological or religious subject matter. He was {{particularly interested in}} Jung's archetypes of the collective unconscious.In 1944 Gleeson created The sower referencing Jean-François Millet’s [...] Rather than showing a landscape with a conglomerate main figure, Gleeson presents an eerie twentieth-century view of a desolated one. He commented on the work's genesis {{as a response to}} the trauma of longtime warfare: I think that there was always the hope that it could influence the way people thought about war. That it could alert people to its horrors and prevent it occurring again. You see, I was born during the First World War in 1915, and my earliest experiences were with people who were in that war or remembered the war very vividly, and then, just when I was beginning to paint, the Second World War began. So war became a kind of lurking terror in my mind from infancy through to late adolescence, when it was all building up again for another one. [...] During the 1950s and '60s he moved to a more symbolic perspective, notions of human perfectibility. At this time he increasingly fashioned small psychedelic compositions made using the surrealist technique of <b>decalcomania</b> in the background, to suggest a landscape, and finished by adding a fastidiously painted male nude in the foreground. Many of his paintings had homoerotic undertones, something which reflected on Gleeson's own homosexuality. The ideas for these compositions also saw Gleeson move into collage with his Locus Solus series, where he produced a substantial body of work by placing dismembered photographs, magazine illustrations, diagrams and lines of visionary poetry against abstract pools of ink.|$|E
