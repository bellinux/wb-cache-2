5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> component is a 1-tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> configuration {{has a unique}} predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Perfect graphs {{are defined}} as the graphs <b>in</b> <b>which,</b> for <b>every</b> induced subgraph, the {{chromatic}} number (minimum number of colors in a coloring) equals {{the size of the}} maximum clique.According to the weak perfect graph theorem, the complement of a perfect graph is also perfect. Therefore, the perfect graphs are also the graphs <b>in</b> <b>which,</b> for <b>every</b> induced subgraph, the clique cover number equals the size of the maximum independent set. It is possible to compute the clique cover number in perfect graphs in polynomial time.|$|R

Suppose that G is a residually finite group <b>in</b> <b>which</b> for <b>every</b> element x ∈ G {{there exists a}} positive integer q=q(x) ≤ m such that x^q is n-Engel. We show that G is locally virtually nilpotent. Further, let w be a multilinear commutator and G a residually finite group <b>in</b> <b>which</b> for <b>every</b> product of at most 896 w-values x there exists a positive integer q=q(x) dividing m such that x^q is n-Engel.

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Fingleton {{made what}} turned out to be his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, a series in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just at the wrong time, falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> innings passed 400.|$|E

5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> edge {{belongs to a}} cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} stories were {{completed}} in one issue, but multi-part stories began to appear {{by the middle of}} the series' first year of publication, and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series. In May 1983, issue #11 introduced many new characters, including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro, who would become a frequently recurring character. Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him, Cobra Commander, and the Baroness. Issue #11 established a pattern for the series <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> so often Marvel would publish an issue introducing a group of characters and vehicles that represented the new year's toy offerings.|$|E

Overall, four tropical cyclones developed, three of which made landfall. The first system was initially observed over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean on September1. It struck Newfoundland the following day, but impact there is unknown. On September3, the next hurricane developed, though it did not effect land in its duration. The third hurricane struck Georgia, accompanied by damaging waves in north Florida.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> ideal is a principal ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E

The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the ideal of a and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>every</b> ideal is a principal ideal).|$|E
