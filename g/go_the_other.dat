5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

There are also arguments that <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way, namely that the life story of Jesus as told by early Christians during the second and third centuries gave rise to new religious movements such as Gnosticism.|$|E

The book thus fails to explain why this alternative perspective doesn't work.|$|E

Off-season moves failed to help the Oilers as they finished with the poorest record in the NHL in 2009–10. It was also easily their worst season as an NHL team.|$|E
25|$|With {{favourable}} {{weather and}} winds, Arun (who is coughing up blood) decides {{to resume the}} climb. Aakash remains at Camp 4 since there is insufficient oxygen for six climbers, and teaches Chand to use the camera. When the climbers reach the Balcony, a dangerous storm hits. Although Sameer Khanna tells the climbers to stay in one place, Arjun leaves for the south summit without telling anyone. Anjali notices that Arjun is missing; Arun tells Anjali and Tashi to go one way while he and Chand <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Arjun, who wanted to climb Everest without oxygen, passes out and is buried by snow. After a two-hour search, Arun and Chand tell Tashi and Anjali to stop; Arjun is probably dead. Searching a bit longer, Anjali and Tashi find Arjun's water bottle and his hand poking out of the snow. They dig him out; Arun and Chand join them, but Arjun refuses water and oxygen. Anjali calls Reena, a BNTV reporter in Everest base camp and Arjun's former lover. After Reena talks to him, Arjun accepts oxygen. When he tells mission sponsor Ramesh Roongta {{that he will not}} continue, Ramesh fears damage to his reputation and is furious. Aakash arrives from Camp 4 with three oxygen cylinders.|$|E

Dawson commented that Darren and Jack are so desperate that [...] "everything seemed easy", but added that they realise their actions were making the situation worse.

500|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the GTAW system depends {{largely on}} the type of metal being welded. [...] Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) is often employed when welding steels, nickel, titanium, and other metals. It can also be used in automatic GTAW of aluminum or magnesium when helium is used as a shielding gas. The negatively charged electrode generates heat by emitting electrons, which travel across the arc, causing thermal ionization of the shielding gas and increasing the temperature of the base material. The ionized shielding gas flows toward the electrode, not the base material, and this can allow oxides to build {{on the surface of the}} weld. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is less common, and is used primarily for shallow welds since less heat is generated in the base material. Instead of flowing from the electrode to the base material, as in DCEN, electrons <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> direction, causing the electrode to reach very high temperatures. To help it maintain its shape and prevent softening, a larger electrode is often used. As the electrons flow toward the electrode, ionized shielding gas flows back toward the base material, cleaning the weld by removing oxides and other impurities and thereby improving its quality and appearance.|$|E

Overseas distribution deals were made with Cooperative Music, Liberator Music, Sony Music Japan and Universal Canada. On March 7, 2012, Garbage confirmed the album track listing via YouTube. Four further tracks recorded for the deluxe edition were confirmed later in a press release issued through the band's own label. In the United Kingdom, 250 copies of the deluxe edition were signed by Garbage and issued {{as part of the}} Record Store Day campaign. The album had a worldwide release date of May 14, 2012.

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let <b>go,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three captives are taken away.|$|E
