5|$|Paralytic {{poliomyelitis}} may be clinically suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of <b>flaccid</b> paralysis {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo's {{attempted}} sexual {{conquest of}} Urania {{is an example}} of both political manipulation of Agustín Cabral and sexual power over young women. However, as Trujillo's penis remains <b>flaccid</b> throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl, the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is <b>flaccid.</b> Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a <b>flaccid</b> penis {{and his love}} of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions of this book, and similar application of psychoanalysis {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, <b>flaccid</b> weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive <b>flaccid</b> paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute <b>flaccid</b> paralysis. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
5|$|Wharanui grow to {{the west}} of the North Island's main divide. They have long, broad <b>flaccid</b> leaves, which may be an {{adaptation}} to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in Wellington, Horowhenua and Whanganui, and extends with some modifications to the southern Taranaki coast. In Taranaki, cabbage trees generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves. In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from Cape Campbell to the northern Catlins, and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the Southern Alps. In Marlborough's Wairau Valley, cabbage trees tend to retain their old, dead leaves, lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{review of}} the {{literature}} found two studies finding height and stretched or <b>flaccid</b> length to be moderately correlated, seven studies finding weak correlation for <b>flaccid,</b> stretched, or erect length, and two studies that found no correlation between <b>flaccid</b> length and height.|$|E
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} {{for wild}} poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing {{of all cases}} of acute <b>flaccid</b> paralysis. Acute <b>Flaccid</b> Paralysis (AFP) is a clinical manifestation of poliomyelitis characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma). AFP is also associated {{with a number of}} other pathogenic agents including enteroviruses, echoviruses, and adenoviruses, among others. among children less than fifteen years of age.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms include <b>flaccid</b> muscle paralysis; {{dogs with}} {{breathing}} difficulties {{will require more}} intensive care monitoring. Muscle paralysis can lead to death due to cardiac and respiratory arrest.|$|E
25|$|Masters and Johnson {{described}} the two-stage detumescence of the penis: In the first stage, the penis decreases from its erect state to about 50 percent larger than its <b>flaccid</b> state. This occurs during the refractory period. In {{the second stage}} (and after the refractory period is finished), the penis decreases in size and returns to being <b>flaccid.</b> It is generally impossible for men to achieve orgasm during the refractory period. Masters and Johnson argue that this period must end before men can become aroused again.|$|E
25|$|In {{poultry and}} wild birds, <b>flaccid</b> {{paralysis}} is usually {{seen in the}} legs, wings, neck and eyelids. Broiler chickens with the toxicoinfectious form may also have diarrhea with excess urates.|$|E
25|$|An Indian {{study of}} 500 men ages 18 to 60 {{published}} in the International Journal of Impotence Research found <b>flaccid,</b> stretched and erect length to be 8.21cm, 10.88cm and 13.01cm, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Neither age nor {{size of the}} <b>flaccid</b> penis {{accurately}} predicted erectile length. Stretched length has {{correlated with}} erect length in some cases. However studies have also shown drastic differences between stretched and erect length.|$|E
25|$|Phimosis {{in older}} {{children}} and adults can vary in severity, with some able to retract their foreskin partially (relative phimosis), and some completely unable to retract their foreskin even when the penis is in the <b>flaccid</b> state (full phimosis).|$|E
25|$|Uterus: {{increased}} levels of estrogen during estrus cause edema within the uterus, making it feel heavier, and the uterus loses its tone. This edema decreases following ovulation, and the muscular tone increases. High levels of progesterone do not cause edema within the uterus. The uterus becomes <b>flaccid</b> during anestrus.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} {{of individuals with}} hand, {{foot and mouth disease}} may require hospital admission due to complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute <b>flaccid</b> paralysis. Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a {{neurotoxic}} protein {{produced by}} the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes <b>flaccid</b> paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics and research.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{serological}} varieties of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to H. The toxin {{from all of}} these acts {{in the same way}} and produces similar symptoms: the motor nerve endings are prevented from releasing acetylcholine, causing <b>flaccid</b> paralysis and symptoms of blurred vision, ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, cramps, and respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Piperazine is a <b>flaccid</b> paralyzing {{agent that}} blocks the {{response}} of Ascaris muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the spores {{releases}} botulinum toxin, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken throughout the body, causing paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Typical symptoms of infant botulism include constipation, lethargy, weakness, difficulty feeding and an altered cry, often progressing to a complete descending <b>flaccid</b> paralysis. Although constipation is usually the first symptom of infant botulism, it is commonly overlooked.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} lesions occur occasionally. Cerebral granulomatous disease {{may be caused}} by S. japonicum eggs in the brain. Communities in China {{affected}} by S. japonicum have been found to have rates of seizures eight times higher than baseline. Similarly, granulomatous lesions from S. mansoni and S. haematobium eggs in the spinal cord can lead to transverse myelitis with <b>flaccid</b> paraplegia. Eggs are thought to travel to the central nervous system via embolization.|$|E
25|$|Noise from {{ships and}} human {{activity}} can damage Cnidarians and Ctenophora, {{which are very}} important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their simple structures. When there is underwater noise, the vibrations in the water damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and {{the results showed that}} damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, <b>flaccid</b> or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} can be slowed by altered sodium and {{potassium}} levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance {{is critical to}} the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and <b>flaccid,</b> and ultimately to fail.|$|E
25|$|During spinal shock, {{the bladder}} is <b>flaccid</b> and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, a spinally {{mediated}} voiding reflex ensues, {{although there is}} no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E
25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in <b>flaccid</b> paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's {{physicians}} {{never mentioned}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, {{indicating that they}} were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility. All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio. In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic <b>flaccid</b> paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. Myositis with <b>flaccid</b> paralysis has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are multifocal spinal cord white matter oedema and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, <b>flaccid</b> paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and <b>flaccid</b> paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{procedural step}} in forming the new breast is the collecting and the joining {{of the three}} folds of breast tissue (the medial pillar and the two lateral pillars) of the lower pole of the breast, where it meets the chest. The suturing is critical to supporting and shaping the <b>flaccid</b> breast tissues into a hemispheric breast-mound that well projects from the chest wall—a lifted breast. The supine patient then is elevated {{to a sitting position}} so that the breasts drape naturally, and the surgeon then delineates upon them the incision plan for the resection (cutting and removing) of the excess folds of skin from the lower sides (inferolateral) and the lower midline (inferomedial) of the new breast. Afterwards, the patient is laid supine, and the excess breast skin is cut; to avoid a scar at the inframammary fold, a purse-string closure gathers the excess folds of skin at the lower pole of the breast; in due course, the three joined pillars of skin will integrate to the inframammary fold. Again, the supine patient is elevated to a sitting position so that the surgeon can ascertain the size, shape, and symmetry, or asymmetry, of the corrected breasts. If the degree of breast-lift is satisfactory, the patient is re-laid to the operating table, and the plastic surgeon sutures the incision wounds.|$|E
25|$|Aina, {{released}} on 18 March 1977, marked a distinct symbolic break between the so-called liberal Zulfikar Ali Bhutto {{years and the}} increasingly conservative cum revolutionary Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq regime. The film stayed in cinemas for over 400weeks, with its last screening at 'Scala' in Karachi where it ran {{for more than four}} years. It is considered the most popular film ever. Films dropped from a total output of 98 in 1979, of which 42 were in Urdu, to only 58 films of which 26 were in Urdu in 1980.. The film industry by now {{was on the verge of}} collapse as people began turning away from cinema. The filmmakers that remained in the industry, employed <b>flaccid</b> story lines to produce Punjabi cult classics like Maula Jatt in 1979, telling the story of a gandasa-carrying protagonist waging a blood-feud with a local gangster. Growing censorship policies against displays of affection, rather than violence, came as a blow to the industry. As a result, violence-ridden Punjabi films prevailed and overshadowed Urdu cinema. The middle class neglected the 'increasingly dilapidated and rowdy cinemas'. This film sub-culture came to be known as the gandasa culture. In Punjabi cinema Sultan Rahi and Anjuman became iconic figures of this culture. In Pashto cinema, filmmakers were able to get around the censor policies and filled their films with soft-core pornography to increase viewership. This was done by the backing by powerful politicians.|$|E
500|$|The venom of this elapid, Laticauda colubrina, {{is a very}} {{powerful}} neurotoxic protein, with a subcutaneous LD50 in mice of [...] 0.45mg/kg body weight. The venom is an α-neurotoxin that disrupts synapses by competing with acetylcholine for receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, similar to erabutoxins and α-bungarotoxins. In mice, lethal venom doses caused lethargy, <b>flaccid</b> paralysis, and convulsions in quick succession before death. Dogs injected with lethal doses produced symptoms consistent with fatal hypertension and cyanosis observed in human sea snake bite victims.|$|E
500|$|If {{poliovirus}} is {{isolated from}} a patient experiencing acute <b>flaccid</b> paralysis, it is further tested through oligonucleotide mapping (genetic fingerprinting), or more recently by PCR amplification, {{to determine whether it}} is [...] "wild type" [...] (that is, the virus encountered in nature) or [...] "vaccine type" [...] (derived from a strain of poliovirus used to produce polio vaccine). [...] It is important to determine the source of the virus because for each reported case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus, an estimated 200 to 3,000 [...] other contagious asymptomatic carriers exist.|$|E
500|$|... "Ode on Indolence" [...] is {{sometimes}} called upon {{as a point of}} comparison when discussing Keats's other poems. Charles Wentworth Dilke observed that while the poem can be read as a supplemental text to assist the study of [...] "Grecian Urn", it remains a much inferior work. In 2000, Thomas McFarland wrote in consideration of Dilke's comparison: [...] "Far more important than the similarity, which might seem to arise from the urns in Keats's purview in both Ode on Indolence and Ode on a Grecian Urn... is the enormous dissimilarity in the two poems. Ode on Indolence... is a <b>flaccid</b> enterprise that hardly bears mention alongside that other achievement." ...|$|E
