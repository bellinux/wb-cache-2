5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) {{meet with}} an {{important}} potential client, Christian (Tim Meadows), at Chili's. The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin {{will not have to}} close one of its branches – a threat that had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a <b>hotel</b> <b>meeting</b> room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal. Afterwards, in the parking lot, Michael and the recently divorced Jan kiss and leave together.|$|E
25|$|Peoria was {{at first}} the southernmost part of New France, then the northernmost part of the French Colony of Louisiana, and finally the westernmost part of the newly formed United States. Fort Crevecoeur was first founded in 1680. Another fort, often called Fort Pimiteoui, and later Old Fort Peoria, was {{established}} in 1691. French interests dominated at Peoria {{for well over a}} hundred years, from the time the first French explorers came up the Illinois River in 1673 until the first United States settlers began to move into the area around 1815. A small French presence persisted for a time on the east bank of the river, but was gone by about 1846. Today, only faint echoes of French Peoria survive in the street plan of downtown Peoria, and in the name of an occasional street, school, or <b>hotel</b> <b>meeting</b> room: Joliet, Marquette, LaSalle.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 1933, Arlosoroff {{organized}} a historic {{event at the}} King David Hotel in Jerusalem on the Jewish Agency's behalf. The luncheon, attended by Weizmann and prominent Arab leaders of Transjordan, {{would be the first}} time Jewish Zionists and key Arabs gathered together to help promote cooperative efforts between the two groups. Arlosoroff hoped that by building an accord with the Arab sheiks of Transjordan, political relations with Arab leaders of Mandatory Palestine might be enhanced. However, not everyone was pleased with Arlosoroff's vision for Jewish/Arab collaboration, nor the possibility of a bi-nationalistic future in Eretz Israel. After the luncheon, Arab radicals openly chastised the moderate Arabs who had attended the meeting. Certain Arab leaders in Mandatory Palestine distanced themselves completely from the Transjordanian Arab delegation. Particular anger was directed at Transjordan's Emir Abdullah, the ruler over large territories in Transjordan, who had taken {{a leading role in the}} conciliation efforts. Jewish opposition to the King David <b>Hotel</b> <b>meeting</b> also became apparent as the major party of religious Zionism, Mizrachi, demanded that Arlosoroff should resign from his position at the Jewish Agency. Some radicals in the Revisionist movement went even further and questioned Arlosoroff's right to be alive.|$|E

They continued on to Kensington Market, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland <b>Hotel,</b> <b>meeting</b> Devon Wilson as she walked down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car {{so that he could}} get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{is thought}} to have stopped {{painting}} by several writers, but she herself tells us that she drew all her life. [...] She moved from Paris to Villa Sant'Agnese, a villa outside Florence, Italy in 1937, and in 1940fleeing the invasion of France by GermanyBarney joined her there. [...] After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to [...] "get back to [...] painting and painter's life", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war. [...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a <b>hotel,</b> <b>meeting</b> Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. [...] She died in Nice, France, in 1970 at the age of 96. Barney and Brooks are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris.|$|E
