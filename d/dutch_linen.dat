50|$|According to {{observations}} by Caspar Hennenberger, in 1539 {{the territory}} was still undeveloped, with an inn and warehouses the only buildings of note. In 1540 Albert I, Duke of Prussia, approved {{development of a}} new suburb known first as Neue Huben and then as Roßgarten. It was declared a Freiheit subordinate to Königsberg Castle in 1542. East Prussian noble families who lived in Rossgarten included the Buddenbrock, Gröben, Götzen, Kunheim, Ostau, Rauter, Schlieben, and Tettau. Many <b>Dutch</b> <b>linen</b> weavers settled in the new suburb by 1553. Latvian merchants also settled in Rossgarten.|$|E
50|$|Pieter Cramer (21 May 1721 (baptized) - 28 September 1776), was {{a wealthy}} <b>Dutch</b> {{merchant}} in <b>linen</b> and Spanish wool, remembered as an entomologist. Cramer {{was the director}} of the Zealand Society, a scientific society located in Flushing, and a member of Concordia et Libertate, based in Amsterdam. This literary and patriotic society, where Cramer gave lectures on minerals, commissioned and/or financed the publishing of his book De uitlandsche Kapellen, on foreign (exotic) butterflies, occurring in three parts of the world Asia, Africa and America.|$|R
25|$|Not {{being an}} economist, Louis resented the preponderant {{share in the}} French market, taken by the Dutch, on {{basically}} emotional grounds, but his new Superintendent of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, gave focused impetus to this resentment by a well-organised complex of economic policies, of a mercantilist nature. The first of these was his tariff list of 1664, which was calculated to just wrest away important French markets from the Dutch, without completely closing down trade (except for the trade in refined sugar, which {{was hit with a}} prohibitive tariff). However, in 1667 this was followed with a much more draconian list that doubled tariffs on <b>Dutch</b> fine cloth, <b>linen,</b> and Delftware; quadrupled them on whale products (for which France was Holland's biggest customer); and raised them sevenfold for tobacco products.|$|R
