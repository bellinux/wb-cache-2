This bill was intended {{to put an end}} to predatory lending activities.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E
500|$|Terminator Salvation had a $200 million budget. The {{shooting}} {{of the film}} started on May 5, 2008, in New Mexico, with parts of the filming taking place at Kirtland Air Force Base, after the United States Air Force agreed to provide the crew guidance and aircraft. [...] The filmmakers had originally intended to begin filming on March 15 in Budapest or Australia, but a 25 percent tax rebate and absence of an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> and floor made the filmmakers seek the cheaper New Mexico, because of their elevated budget. To avoid delays caused by a possible 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike in July, all exterior scenes were completed by then, so production could restart easily. The shoot ended on July 20, 2008, though some pick-ups took place in January 2009.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, these created {{problems}} for some banks {{as the high}} inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates than they could lend it. In response to this asset liability mismatch, libertarians and free-market advocates called for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> to be increased or repealed entirely as an unreasonable restriction on market forces. Bills to do so were introduced in Congress and some state legislatures. Some succeeded in the former goal, but those that sought to eliminate <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> entirely failed.|$|R
50|$|Though conceptually simple, {{there is}} much {{variation}} in the methodologies used by governments to implement limits on lending rates.

40|$|Asset prices {{depend on}} two elements: the {{dynamics}} of the state variables and the pricing kernel. Traditional term structure models differ in the factor dynamics. However, most of them imply a log-linear pricing kernel. We investigate empirically the role of factor dynamics and pricing kernel in pricing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivatives using a nonparametric approach. We find that the prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> are very sensitive to the specification of the factor dynamics, especially when they are close to expiration. In addition, nonlinear log-pricing kernels improve the pricing of long-maturity caps. Recent research document models that fit libor and swap rates but do not price derivatives well, leading to the so called “unspanned stochastic volatility puzzle”. Additional factors seem to be needed to explain cap prices. However, the relative mispricing between <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> and underlying libor and swap rates could also potentially be due to mis-specification of the parametric models used. Our paper provides evidence, from a nonparametric perspective, for the inability of diffusion-only type of models to price <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps.</b> Models with jumps such as that in Jarrow, Li, and Zhao (JF, forthcoming) is needed to explain the prices of libor options...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares two {{different}} strategies for managing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exposure. One involves maintaining a borrowing portfolio using {{short and long}} term debt lines in order to maintain an average borrowing cost. The second involves using <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> to manage exposure to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. The two strategies are compared using a set of daily quarterly rates from three months out to 10 years (120 months) of BBSW zero rates, par rates and forward rates from June 2000 to September 2006. The data set of implied volatilities (Appendix I used for interest cap quoting and pricing) consists of volatilities for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 year maturities; the data set is made up of daily closing mid-quotes for the period. We examine whether <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> would be a better alternative for minimising <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk as compared to a structure that combines a portfolio of rolling short-term debt with one of rolling long-term debt lines. Using principal component analysis (PCA) we explore the behaviour of, and the number of factors driving volatilities. As caps are quoted in terms of implied volatilities, and we know BlackÃŒs (1976) model is very sensitive to changes in these volatilities. We use PCA to examine the factors driving cap price volatilities. We explore the best way of using <b>caps</b> to manage <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. This should help us understand what factors affect cap prices and how many factors might be used in the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models used to price <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivatives such as caps and floors. We use Sharpe ratios to assess the relative borrowing costs of different strategies in relation to the volatility of their outcomes. We examine whether <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> would be a more efficient method for minimising <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk as compared to the a portfolio of loans.

50|$|The initial {{interest}} rate, or IIR, is {{the actual}} note rate at which interest accrues on the outstanding loan balance on an annual basis. For fixed-rate reverse mortgages, the IIR can never change. For adjustable-rate reverse mortgages, the IIR can change with program limits up to a lifetime <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|European Put {{options on}} zero coupon bonds {{can be seen}} to be {{equivalent}} to suitable caplets, i.e. <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> components, whereas call options {{can be seen to}} be equivalent to suitable floorlets, i.e. components of interest rate floors. See for example Brigo and Mercurio (2001), who also discuss bond options valuation with different models.|$|E
50|$|An <b>{{interest}}</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> {{is a type}} {{of interest}} rate derivative in which the buyer receives payments {{at the end of each}} period in which the interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price.

2500|$|An All-party Early Day Motion tabled in November 2011 {{highlighted}} Wonga's [...] "high APR" [...] {{and seeks}} to restrict the level of interest that can be charged on all loans by financial institutions. British MP Stella Creasy has also proposed legislation for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps.</b> A Policis report on proposed <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>capping</b> said it would cause an exit from the market and those {{with access to the}} credit mainstream would be diverted to products such as overdrafts and revolving credit that could be higher cost than high APR products and those without access to credit would be diverted to the black credit market. The Times said capping will further limit the availability of credit to people from regulated entities.|$|R
50|$|He {{states that}} from an {{economic}} perspective, input based solutions like <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> or subsidies distort the market and hence it would better to let the market determine the <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> and to support certain desirable sectors through other means (such as output-based aid.

50|$|Under BDT, using a {{binomial}} lattice, one calibrates {{the model}} parameters to fit both the current term structure of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (yield curve), and the volatility structure for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> (usually as {{implied by the}} Black-76-prices for each component caplet); see aside.

5000|$|The {{researcher}} [...] {{decided that}} {{to assess the}} appropriateness of an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> as a policy instrument, (or whether other approaches {{would be more likely}} to achieve the desired outcomes of government), it was vital to consider what exactly makes up the interest rate and how banks and MFIs are able to justify rates that might be considered excessive.|$|E
50|$|Consider an {{investor}} A {{who has an}} obligation to pay floating 6 month LIBOR annually on a notional N and which (when invested) earns 6%. A rise in LIBOR above 6% will hurt the investor while a drop will benefit her. Thus it is desirable for her to purchase an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> which will pay her back if the LIBOR rises above her level of comfort. Figuring that she is comfortable paying up to 7%, she enters into an <b>Interest</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Cap</b> with counterparty B wherein B will pay her the difference between 6 mo LIBOR and 7% when the LIBOR exceeds 7% for a premium of 0.08*N. To offset this premium, she sells an Interest Rate Floor to counterparty C wherein she will pay them the difference between 6 mo LIBOR and 5% when the LIBOR falls below 5%. For this she receives 0.075*N premium, thus offsetting what she paid for the Cap.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a modified constant elasticity of variance (MCEV) model. This model uses the familiar constant elasticity of variance {{form for the}} volatility of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) in a continuous market. It leads to a GOP that follows {{the power of a}} time-transformed squared Bessel process. This paper derives analytic real-world prices for zero-coupon bonds, instantaneous forward rates and options on the GOP that are both theoretically revealing and computationally efficient. In addition, the paper examines options on exchange prices and options on zero-coupon bonds under the MCEV model. The semi-analytic prices derived for options on zero-coupon bonds can subsequently be used to price <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> and floors.

5000|$|The {{researcher}} {{found it}} intuitive that basic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> {{are most likely}} to bite {{at the lower end of}} the market, with <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> charged by microfinance institutions generally higher than those by banks [...] and this is driven by a higher cost of funds and higher relative overheads.
