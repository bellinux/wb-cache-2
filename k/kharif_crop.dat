50|$|This is {{a typical}} Indian village with farming as the major {{occupation}} of the populace.

There are reasons for observing the festival in the month of Bhadrava even though the food grain is not ready for harvesting.

50|$|The major {{economic}} {{activity of the}} village is agriculture, mainly subsistence based, and carpet weaving. The landless people weave the famous bhadohi woolen carpets but not the people from higher caste of Brahmins. Many people have migrated to Kolkata and Mumbai and post order money is a very prominent source of income. There is one rabi crop of wheat and another <b>kharif</b> <b>crop</b> of rice mainly with help of irrigation by ground water pumped through a government-installed bore well {{and a couple of}} private ones. There is hardly any commercial cropping. Much of land is alkaline, posing a great difficulty to agricultural activity.|$|E

50|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the chief}} grains of India. Moreover, this country has the largest area under rice cultivation, as it {{is one of the}} {{principal}} food crops. It is in fact the dominant crop of the country. India is one of the leading producers of this crop. Rice is the basic food crop and being a tropical plant, it flourishes comfortably in hot and humid climate. Rice is mainly grown in rain fed areas that receive heavy annual rainfall. That is why it is fundamentally a <b>kharif</b> <b>crop</b> in India. It demands temperature of around 25 degree Celsius and above and rainfall of more than 100 cm. Rice is also grown through irrigation in those areas that receives comparatively less rainfall. Rice is the staple food of eastern and southern parts of India. In 2009-10, total rice production in India amounted to 89.13 million tonnes, which was much less than production of previous year, 99.18 million tonnes.|$|E

50|$|The chief Kharif {{crops are}} the millets, known as Bajra and Jowar, paddy and maize. These are sown either {{alone or in}} {{combination}} with Arhar. Bajra is chiefly grown in light and sandy soil. Between 1903 and 1907 Bajra alone or in combination covered 42.511 ha. or 28.47 per cent of the kharif. In the subsequent year its cultivation in the district increased by nearly 12,900ha. In 1380 Fasli year that is 1973-74 the bajra covered an area of 77.673 ha. Jowar is generally grown in the stiffer and better soils but like bajra it is usually mixed with arhar, the proportion grown alone being only 5per cent. Both Bajra and Jowar are usually sown in June on unirrigated land, the fields being previously prepared by ploughing. They are reaped in November. A considerable amount of Jowar is grown only for fodder especially in Etawah and Bharthana tahsils. Another important <b>Kharif</b> <b>crop</b> is rice. There has been an enormous increase in the extent of rice cultivation during the last hundred years. Several local varieties of rice are grown. In 1973-74 (1380 Fasli year) the area covered by paddy was 2,59,506 ha. The only other <b>Kharif</b> <b>crop</b> that is of any importance is maize which during the period between 1903 and 1907 covered on the average 52.321 acres or 14.18 per cent of the area cultivated in the kharif. The only tahsil however, where it is extensively planted is Bidhuna. Maize is usually sown in the best gauhani dumat soil, close to the village site, where the fields yield two crops a year. The land is generally well manured and the crops are sown {{as early as possible}} in Asharh. During the ensuing month the field is carefully weeded and by the middle of Bhadon the plants usually attain a height of four feet and the ears begin to show. Among the Kharif cereals small pulses known as Moth, Urd and Moong, the small millet Mandua, and Hemp or Sanai were largely grown in the past, but new incentives in the field of agriculture have lowered their popularity and more valuable crops like paddy, maize and sugar-cane are gradually replacing them. In 1997-98 the production of pulses was 21977 metric tonnes and by sugar-cane was 80647 Metric tonnes.|$|E

The LF population was initiated at about 25 standard meteorological weeks (SMW), improved at first slowly up to 27 SMW then steadily up to 32 SMW attaining the maximum at about 34 SMW which was maintained up to about 37 SMW. The population then subsumed at first slowly up to 40 SMW then abruptly. Abiotic conditions such as minimum temperature, temperature gradient, maximum relative humidity and average relative humidity had significant positive influence on C. medinalis population. In case of minimum relative humidity and sunshine hours a negative influence was observed. In addition, other factors such as maximum temperature, relative humidity gradient, average relative humidity, number of rainy days and rainfall imparted insignificant positive effect on population development.

50|$|The {{nature has}} blessed Khanozai with {{two types of}} {{physical}} resources i.e. agriculture and mineral resources. The brief description of these resources are given below. 1. Agriculture The agriculture sector {{has long been the}} dominant and flourishing resource of the area. There are two cropping seasons in Khanozai. <b>Kharif</b> <b>crops</b> are sown in summer and harvested in late summer or early winter while Rabi crops are wheat, barely, cumin, vegetables and fodder. <b>Crops</b> sown during <b>Kharif</b> <b>cropping</b> season include melon, tobacco, potato, onion, vegetables and fodder. These are cash crops and contributing as prompt financial support for farmers. The farmer of the area use scarce water resources in an efficient and effective manner. Generally, those crops which require much water are produced in the area, however, since the recent past, the trend is going to change to produce those which need comparatively less water. During Rabi cropping season, wheat constitute the major share of irrigated area, followed by vegetables, cumin, barley, and fodder. During the <b>Kharif</b> <b>cropping</b> season, fruits are produced at larger scale, followed by tobacco and vegetables particularly potatoes and onions are also important <b>Kharif</b> <b>crops.</b> The farmers in Khanozai are highly commercialized and produce market crops. They have expanded their cropping pattern from subsistence to high valued cash crops over the years. It can be concluded that the major threat to the future of agriculture in Khanozai include down going water table and high costs of agricultural inputs such as electricity, fertilizers and labor (Ashraf & Routray, 2013). Agriculture basically constitute two important sub-sectors i.e. horticulture and livestock. 1.1 Horticulture Horticulture is the prominent sub-sector of the Khanozai and enormous quantities of good qualities of apple - Tor Colo, Shin Colo and Gaja, etc., are produced (Education Department Government of Balochistan, 2011). Fruit production is also now dominating in the area as it requires less amount of water compared to those of apple. It may easily be concluded that horticulture remains a dominant sector in the area’s economy. The cropping pattern explains the types of crops produced by the farmers in tehsil Karezat including Khanozai and district Pishin. The cropping pattern explored by a very recent study (Ashraf. & Routray., 2014), validates that fruits are produced at larger scale followed by wheat and vegetables.|$|R
