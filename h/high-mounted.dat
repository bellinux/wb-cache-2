5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a <b>high-mounted,</b> full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{second was}} the Batwing Limousine, a three-seat cabin {{monoplane}} with a conventional fuselage and <b>high-mounted</b> wing.|$|E
25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one stop lamp, mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a stop lamp function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental <b>high-mounted</b> stop and turn signal lights integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual <b>high-mounted</b> supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time. Auto and lamp manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high-mount supplemental stop lamps in the early 1980s, but this effort, too, failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support.|$|E

5000|$|The neon center <b>high-mount</b> {{stop lamp}} is {{replaced}} with a more conventional LED lamp.|$|R
50|$|Stanley's {{products}} include standard headlights (HID) {{as well as}} LED headlights. Stanley {{developed the}} world's first LED <b>high-mount</b> stop lamp.|$|R
25|$|The Lavochkin La-168 first flew on April 22, 1948. (The American F-86 Sabre {{had first}} flown in October 1947.) It was {{designed}} {{to use the new}} turbojet based on the Rolls-Royce Nene in response to a 1946 request for an advanced swept-wing jet fighter capable of transonic performance. The engine was placed behind the pilot, but with a <b>high-mounted</b> wing and T-tail compared to the similar MiG-15.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Vampire {{has several}} key {{differences}} from their land-based counterparts. It {{could be easily}} distinguished be {{the presence of a}} V-shaped arrestor hook that retracted to a <b>high-mounted</b> position above the jet pipe. The Sea Vampire was fitted with enlarged air brakes and landing flaps for superior low speed control during landing approaches, along with construction to higher load factors to account for the greater stresses involved in carrier landings.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} extra engines {{and the very}} {{different}} crew compartment, together with the removal of passenger accommodation, the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick centre section and <b>high-mounted</b> outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower longerons of the centre section.|$|E
50|$|A centre <b>high-mount</b> {{stop light}} (CHMSL) was added late in Series I {{production}} {{as it was}} mandated by 1 July 1989.|$|R
50|$|A centre <b>high-mount</b> {{stop light}} (CHMSL) was {{introduced}} prior to 1 July 1989 due to regulations in Australia {{requiring them to}} be fitted to all passenger cars manufactured from this date.|$|R
50|$|Channel 7, 131m <b>high—Mount</b> Corhanwarrabul (628m), this {{tower is}} from {{interesting}} design, {{as it is}} a partially guyed tower, consisting of a free-standing lattice tower as basement and a guyed mast as pinnacle.|$|R
25|$|Drawing on {{experience}} from the Hawker Siddeley Trident and the Airbus A300, both the fuselage and wing were carefully {{designed for a}} reduced part-count and complexity. A <b>high-mounted</b> wing was adopted with an uninterrupted top surface; the BAe 146's wing did not make use of leading-edge extensions, which also enabled a simplified fixed tailplane. The undercarriage of the aircraft is toughened to resist damage and stability is maximised by the placement of landing gear, of particular value when operating from rough airstrips.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a {{tricycle undercarriage}} and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a <b>high-mounted</b> tailplane {{clear of the}} jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high transonic speeds, large trim changes, high stick forces and self-sustained yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.|$|E
25|$|The 1971–78 {{generation}} is mainly noted {{for the early}} use of two safety features that are now required on all cars in the United States, the aforementioned <b>high-mounted</b> taillights (although a somewhat similar feature had appeared briefly as an option on the Ford Thunderbird in the late 1960s), and from 1974 through 1976, the Toronado was part of GM's first experimental production run of driver- and passenger-side airbags, which GM named the Air Cushion Restraint System. These Toronados used a unique steering wheel and were fitted with a knee blocker beneath the driver's portion of the dashboard.|$|E
25|$|The linear {{format of}} the neon light source lends itself to centre <b>high-mount</b> stop lamp installation, and neon lights offer the same nearly instant rise time as LEDs. However, neon tubes require a ballast.|$|R
50|$|A center <b>high-mount</b> {{stop lamp}} was installed. The {{regulation}} {{called for a}} third brake light {{at the base of}} the rear window. However, due to the design of the van's rear lights, it was below the tail lights, making the name something of a misnomer.|$|R
50|$|Urban Chrome is {{a version}} of the 250 Highway Star and 350 Highway Star with dark chrome grille, {{exclusive}} dark chrome fog lamp finisher, front protector, exclusive graphite-finish 18-inch aluminium wheels, clear rear combination lamp, LED <b>high-mount</b> strap lamp (clear type), and power sliding doors on the 250 Highway Star (standard on regular 350 Highway Star versions).|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{an unusual}} configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin, reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter, that provides 270° panoramic vision and almost vertical downward {{vision for the}} pilot and two passengers. The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a <b>high-mounted</b> tailplane. It {{is powered by a}} Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch ducted fan. Due to the ducted fan, the aircraft is exceptionally quiet. The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left. The wings are unswept and untapered. The aircraft is of fairly standard all-metal construction with stressed skin of aluminium.|$|E
25|$|The first Tu-124A {{prototype}}, SSSR-45075, first flew on 29 July 1963. On 22 October 1963, {{the prototype}} British BAC One-Eleven, {{which had a}} similar layout, crashed {{with the loss of}} all crew while testing its stalling properties. The aircraft had entered pitch-up: the <b>high-mounted</b> tailplane became trapped in the turbulent wake produced by the wings (deep stall), which prevented recovery from the stall. As a result, the tailplane on Tu-124A was enlarged by 30% for greater control authority. Since Aeroflot's requirements dictated a larger aircraft than initially planned, the Soloviev Design Bureau developed the more powerful D-30 low-bypass turbofan engines. On 20 November 1963, the new airliner was designated Tu-134.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Swearingen Aircraft {{developed}} a prototype SA-28T eight-seat jet aircraft with a flapless delta wing. It shared the tail and cockpit with the Merlin/Metro. The two engines {{were to be}} Garrett TFE731 turbofans then in development; they were originally to be mounted on the aft fuselage, however {{during the course of}} design work their location was moved to under the <b>high-mounted</b> wing. Early flights were to be undertaken with General Electric CJ610 engines fitted. Development continued after Fairchild acquired the company, but the project was shut down nine weeks from first flight. It was later cut up as scrap and the fuselage used as a Metro display at trade shows.|$|E
25|$|Neon lamp tubes were {{introduced}} into series production for the centre <b>high-mount</b> stop lamp on the 1995 Ford Explorer. Notable later uses included the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII with a neon tube spanning {{the width of}} the trunk decklid, and the BMW Z8, which made extensive use of neon. Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included neon lamp features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Hummer H1s {{have other}} unusual features, such as inboard brakes and portal gears {{that allow the}} drivetrain's half shafts a higher placement, for greater ground clearance. The {{radiator}} is up high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood. The air intake is <b>high-mount,</b> enabling the H1 to ford waist-level water. Rather than using simple runflat tires, magnesium-aluminum alloy or rubber inserts are an optional feature for runflat ability.|$|R
50|$|Neon lamp tubes were {{introduced}} into series production for the centre <b>high-mount</b> stop lamp on the 1995 Ford Explorer.

Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included neon lamp features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|R
25|$|The Herald {{attracted}} much early interest {{around the}} world because of its astonishing short field performance and excellent flight characteristics, but Handley Page failed to close many of the deals, as the F-27 and the HS.748 had become rival offerings, both of which proved significantly more popular. A key design feature of the Herald was the <b>high-mounted</b> wing, but with a noticeable dihedral. In addition, the Herald's vertical fin was covered with miniature airfoils, adding further to the Herald's excellent stability. Pilots reported that the Herald flew like a dream; very stable in the air, yet highly manoeuvrable even at slow speed. Ground handling {{was said to be}} the Herald's only vice due to an overlarge tailfin.|$|E
25|$|Three {{models of}} the 1930s were the Peugeot 202, Peugeot 302, and Peugeot 402. These cars had curvaceous bodies, with {{headlights}} behind sloping grille bars, evidently inspired by the Chrysler Airflow. The 2.1-liter 402 entered production in 1935 and was produced {{until the end of}} 1941, despite France's occupation by the Nazis. For 1936, the new Airflow-inspired 302 (which ran until 1938) and a 402-based large model, designed by Andrean, featured a vertical fin and bumper, with the first <b>high-mounted</b> taillight. The entry-level 202 was built in series from 1938 to 1942, and about 20 more examples were built from existing stocks of supplies in February 1945. The 202 lifted Peugeot's sales in 1939 to 52,796, just behind Citroën. Regular production began again in mid-1946, and lasted into 1949.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four passenger seats present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and <b>high-mounted</b> tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air ambulance operators.|$|E
2500|$|At first, five {{models of}} Yugo {{were sold in}} the United States for the 1987 model year: the basic {{entry-level}} $3,990 GV (for [...] "Great Value"), the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the race-inspired GVX with the 1300 cc engine, five-speed manual transmission, and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, rally lights, and a centre <b>high-mount</b> stop lamp. The Cabrio convertible was introduced in 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CL70 Scrambler {{was a small}} {{motorcycle}} with a [...] four-stroke engine, a {{pressed steel}} frame and a four-speed manual gearbox. It was built by Honda between 1969 and 1973. It essentially replaced the Honda CL90. It was very similar to a CL50 with a larger engine. As a scrambler, it had a <b>high-mount</b> exhaust and a high rear fender. This allowed the look, though not really the capability, of extended off-road capability, before real dual-sport motorcycles were available.|$|R
5000|$|The gun was {{installed}} as a conventional coast defence gun in South Africa and Australia, and several in the United Kingdom. Its more common use ashore in the UK was as [...] "moveable armaments" [...] in forts : on 2-wheeled carriages similar to field carriages but intended only for moving short distances to position guns for defence of the fort. These used either obsolete 40-pounder RML carriages or special <b>high-mounting</b> carriages for firing over parapets with recoil {{controlled by a}} hydraulic buffer built into the platform to which the carriage was fastened.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of its introduction, the Vigilante was {{one of the largest and}} by far the most complex {{aircraft}} to operate from a United States Navy aircraft carrier. It had a <b>high-mounted</b> swept wing with a boundary-layer control system (blown flaps) to improve low-speed lift. There were no ailerons. Roll control was provided by spoilers in conjunction with differential deflection of the all-moving tail surfaces. The use of aluminum-lithium alloy for wing skins and titanium for critical structures was also unusual. The A-5 had two widely spaced General Electric J79 turbojet engines (the same as used on the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter), fed by intake ramps and a single large all-moving vertical stabilizer. Preliminary design studies had employed twin vertical fin/rudders. The wings, vertical stabilizer and the nose radome folded for carrier stowage. The Vigilante had a crew of two seated in tandem, a pilot and a bombardier-navigator (BN) (reconnaissance/attack navigator (RAN) on later reconnaissance versions) in individual North American HS-1A ejection seats.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The <b>high-mounted</b> stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|SS V 60th Anniversary: {{like the}} 60th Anniversary Omega-based edition, the SS V pack {{launched}} on 1 May 2008. Over the standard production SS V, the anniversary model added 10-spoke 20-inch alloy wheels, satellite navigation, rear parking sensors, a <b>high-mounted</b> rear spoiler, chrome exterior door handle highlights and [...] "60th Anniversary" [...] badging and floor mats.|$|E
50|$|The KE {{is easy to}} {{distinguish}} from the earlier KC, by different grilles, headlights, tail lights, body-side mouldings, bonnet, front guards, and on some models, wheels. The dashboard and instrument cluster received new graphics, and the interior was available in slightly different colour shades to the KC. In mid-1989, {{in preparation for a}} new ADR (Australian Design Rule) to come into effect in 1990, all models were fitted with a <b>high-mount</b> rear stop lamp as standard. When the redesigned KF Laser was introduced in March 1990, the wagon continued in a sole GL specification, with minor upgrades until 1994, when Australian production of the Laser ceased.|$|R
50|$|In March 1957, Shorts {{submitted}} {{its first}} brochure on their proposed transport aircraft, {{designated as the}} PD.18 and given the name Britannic to reflect its Britannia ancestry. The PD.18 only differed from the Britannia {{in terms of its}} fuselage and <b>high-mounting</b> of its wings; the wings themselves, along with the tail unit, engines, and major portions of the landing gear and various other systems were common to both types. The new circular cross-section fuselage was very large for the era, capable of accommodating a 12 ft-square load for the carriage of bulky loads such as radar units and the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM); it also allows for troops to be carried across two separate decks.|$|R
2500|$|The six-cylinder {{engines that}} were {{introduced}} by AMC in 1964 were continued. However, the 1967 Rebel models introduced {{the first of}} a family of all-new V8s that replaced AMC's long-lived [...] "Gen-1" [...] designs in the mid-sized automobile market segment. These included the [...] and [...] engines that debuted in the 1966 Rambler American. With a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, the 343V8 produced [...] at 4800rpm and [...] of torque at 3000rpm. The new Rebels also eliminated the torque tube design used in the Rambler Classic in favor of an open drive shaft with a four-link, trailing-arm rear live axle rear suspension system to provide a more comfortable coil spring ride. The independent front suspension continued to use AMC's unequal-length control arms and <b>high-mount</b> coil springs.|$|R
