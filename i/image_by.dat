5|$|Gordon {{arrives at}} the {{building}} where Rachel perished, at which point Dent judges his fate, along with his own and Batman's, with three separate coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence caused his family to die. Before he can, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent's heroic <b>image</b> <b>by</b> holding Batman responsible for the killing spree. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs and {{walks out of the}} room, and Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter from Rachel about her choice to marry Dent.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne {{take place in}} a {{separate}} continuity {{to the rest of the}} Megami Tensei series. Nocturne is set in modern-day Tokyo before and after an event called the Conception, in which the normal world is destroyed through the actions of a cult to prevent the world's stagnation and ultimate demise, as dictated by the Great Will governing existence. Tokyo is transformed into a wasteland on the inside of a sphere inhabited by the spirits of humans who died in the Conception; demons who wage war with each other; and Reasons, deity-like beings formed from the gathering of Magatsuhi by people with a deity or demon sponsor. Those who possess Reasons seek to remake the world in their <b>image</b> <b>by</b> presenting themselves to Kagutsuchi, a semi-sentient manifestation of the Great Will's power which exists to perpetuate the destruction and rebirth of worlds through Conception, and proving their worth. Another realm mentioned in the story is the Shadow Vortex, a limbo where dead worlds and the beings who created them linger.|$|E
