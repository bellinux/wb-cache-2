For this purpose, 97 blasting operations in Delkan iron mine, Iran were investigated and the most effective parameters on <b>flyrock</b> were recorded. A database comprising of five inputs (i. e. burden, spacing, stemming length, hole depth, and powder factor) and one output (<b>flyrock)</b> was prepared to develop <b>flyrock</b> distance. Several GP and GEP models were proposed to predict <b>flyrock</b> considering the modeling procedures of them.

40|$|The {{environmental}} effects of blasting must be controlled in order to comply with regulatory limits. Because of safety concerns and risk of damage to infrastructures, equipment, and property, and also having a good fragmentation, <b>flyrock</b> control is crucial in blasting operations. If measures to decrease <b>flyrock</b> are taken, then the <b>flyrock</b> distance would be limited, and, in return, the risk of damage can be reduced or eliminated. This paper deals with modeling the level of risk associated with <b>flyrock</b> and, also, <b>flyrock</b> distance prediction based on the rock engineering systems (RES) methodology. In the proposed models, 13 effective parameters on <b>flyrock</b> due to blasting are considered as inputs, and the <b>flyrock</b> distance and associated level of risks as outputs. In selecting input data, the simplicity of measuring input data was taken into account as well. The data for 47 blasts, carried out at the Sungun copper mine, western Iran, were used to predict the level of risk and <b>flyrock</b> distance corresponding to each blast. The obtained results showed that, for the 47 blasts carried out at the Sungun copper mine, the level of estimated risks are mostly {{in accordance with the}} measured <b>flyrock</b> distances. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the results of the <b>flyrock</b> distance predictive RES-based model, the multivariate regression analysis model (MVRM), and, also, the dimensional analysis model. For the RES-based model, R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are equal to 0. 86 and 10. 01, respectively, whereas for the MVRM and dimensional analysis, R 2 and RMSE are equal to (0. 84 and 12. 20) and (0. 76 and 13. 75), respectively. These achievements confirm the better performance of the RES-based model over the other proposed models...|$|E

Therefore, proper prediction and subsequently optimization of <b>flyrock</b> distance may reduce the possible damages. The first objective {{of this study is to}} develop a new predictive model based on gene expression programming (GEP) for predicting <b>flyrock</b> distance. To achieve this aim, three granite quarry sites in Malaysia were investigated and a database composed of blasting data of 76 operations was prepared for modelling. Considering changeable GEP parameters, several GEP models were constructed and the best one among them was selected. Coefficient of determination values of 0. 920 and 0. 924 for training and testing datasets, respectively, demonstrate that GEP predictive equation is capable enough of predicting <b>flyrock.</b> The second objective of this study is to optimize blasting data for minimization purpose of <b>flyrock.</b> To do this, a new non-traditional optimization algorithm namely firefly algorithm (FA) was selected and used. For optimization purposes, a series of analyses were performed on the FA parameters. As a result, implementing FA algorithm, a reduction of about 34 % in results of <b>flyrock</b> distance (from 60 to 39. 793 m) was observed.

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} is a widely-used {{method for}} rock fragmentation in open-pit mines, tunneling and civil projects. <b>Flyrock,</b> {{as one of}} the most dangerous effects induced by blasting, can cause substantial damage to structures and injury to human. Therefore, the ability to make proper predictions of <b>flyrock</b> distance is important to reduce and minimize the environmental side effects caused by blasting operation. The main goal of the present research is to develop a precise equation for predicting <b>flyrock</b> through particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. For comparison purpose, multiple linear regression (MLR) was also used. In this regard, a database including several controllable blasting parameters was collected from 76 blasting events in three quarry sites, Malaysia. In modeling procedures, five effective parameters on the <b>flyrock</b> including burden, spacing, stemming, powder factor and rock density were used as input parameters, while <b>flyrock</b> was considered as output parameter. In order to check the performance of the developed models, several statistical functions, i. e., root-mean-square error, Nash and Sutcliffe and coefficient of multiple determination (R 2), were computed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO equation is more reliable than MLR in predicting the <b>flyrock.</b> Based on sensitivity analysis results, it was also found that the RD was the most effective parameter on the <b>flyrock</b> in the studied cases...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flyrock</b> is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} main causes of human injury, fatalities, and structural damage among all undesirable environmental impacts of blasting. Therefore, it seems that the proper prediction/simulation of <b>flyrock</b> is essential, especially in order to determine blast safety area. If proper control measures are taken, then the <b>flyrock</b> distance can be controlled, and, in return, the risk of damage can be reduced or eliminated. The first objective {{of this study was to}} develop a predictive model for <b>flyrock</b> estimation based on multiple regression (MR) analyses, and after that, using the developed MR model, <b>flyrock</b> phenomenon was simulated by the Monte Carlo (MC) approach. In order to achieve objectives of this study, 62 blasting operations were investigated in Ulu Tiram quarry, Malaysia, and some controllable and uncontrollable factors were carefully recorded/calculated. The obtained results of MC modeling indicated that this approach is capable of simulating <b>flyrock</b> ranges with a good level of accuracy. The mean of simulated <b>flyrock</b> by MC was obtained as 236. 3 m, while this value was achieved as 238. 6 m for the measured one. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to investigate the effects of model inputs on the output of the system. The analysis demonstrated that powder factor is the most influential parameter on fly rock among all model inputs.

40|$|Abstract. With so many complex {{influence}} {{factors of}} blasting <b>flyrock,</b> {{there is no}} critical formula for prediction the flying distance of blasting <b>flyrock</b> which was adapted {{by most of the}} scholars. Widely existing influential prediction formulas are mainly aimed at ordinary blasting technology, using the statistical law or mechanics analysis to get the prediction. The calculated data for <b>flyrock</b> distance are different distinctly. Predictive values are different largely between various formulas. Moreover, when loose blasting, the values predicted by those formulas will be larger than the actual data. This situation wastes lots of human and financial resources for blasting alert. In view of the present situation, the field experiment of loosening blasting was carried and the impacts of blasting parameters to the <b>flyrock</b> distance in loosening blasting were considered respectively. Some blasting parameters were regressed to get a prediction formula. The correlation analysis indicates that the formula for loosening blasting is good for flying distance...|$|E
40|$|Blasting, as {{the most}} {{frequently}} used method for hard rock fragmentation, is a hazardous aspect in mining industries. These operations produce several undesirable environmental impacts such as ground vibration, air-overpressure (AOp), and <b>flyrock</b> in the nearby environments. These environmental impacts may cause injury to human and damage to structures, groundwater, and ecology of the nearby area. This paper is aimed to predict the blasting environmental impacts in granite quarry sites through two intelligent systems, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). For this purpose, 166 blasting operations at four granite quarry sites in Malaysia were investigated and the values of peak particle velocity (PPV), AOp, and <b>flyrock</b> were precisely recorded in each blasting operation. Considering some model performance indices including coefficient of determination (R 2), value account for (VAF), and root mean square error (RMSE), and also using simple ranking procedure, the best models for prediction of PPV, AOp, and <b>flyrock</b> were selected. The results demonstrated that the ANFIS models yield higher performance capacity compared to ANN models. In the case of testing datasets, the R 2 values of 0. 939, 0. 947, and 0. 959 for prediction of PPV, AOp, and <b>flyrock,</b> respectively, suggest the superiority of the ANFIS technique, while in predicting PPV, AOp, and <b>flyrock</b> using ANN technique, these values are 0. 771, 0. 864, and 0. 834, respectively...|$|E

Both the mining and construction industries are targeted with these helpful communication tools. These new products can be used as refresher training for employees and as introductory safety materials for onsite visitors. Background Every blast is associated with the fragmentation, and sometimes the projection, of rocks. <b>Flyrock</b> and blast area security dominate blasting-related accidents in surface mining. From 1978 to 2004, 311 people were killed or injured by <b>flyrock</b> at surface mining operations. Poor blast area security was often to blame. <b>Flyrock</b> is any debris that lands outside the designated blasting area. It can vary in mass from marble-sized to car-sized and can be incredibly dangerous and potentially fatal. <b>Flyrock</b> can be the result of an overloaded blast hole, the presence of underground voids, insufficient burden, or an inadequately sized blast area. Proper planning by the blaster is necessary prior to a blast to prevent or minimize the occurrence of <b>flyrock.</b> Forty percent of blasting injuries and fatalities in mining occur when people are within the blast area. Since blasted material is expected to fall within the blast area, good blast area security is essential {{to ensure the safety of}} site personnel. Figure 1 illustrates the importance of securing the blast area. Prior to a blast at a surface limestone mine, an equipment operator used his pickup truck to guard a road leading to the blast site. During the blast, a stone was projected through the truck's windshield, killing him. Preblast planning is essential for determining blast area security since each plan has to be site-specific. Following a blast, the blaster should walk the blast area to determine if the designated area was large enough and to see if changes should be made to the next shot to improve site safety. The products described here were developed for use in short safety training sessions such as start-ofshift safety talks at the worksite. The information can be presented in 15 -minute segments. The training can be tailored to any work setting by substituting appropriate examples and by discussing the individual teaching points in relation to the worksite.

Mine Safety and Health Administration accident data indicate that <b>flyrock</b> and lack of blast area security were the primary causes of blasting-related injuries in surface mining. Fatal injuries {{due to lack of}} blast area security were primarily caused by failure to clear blast area or inadequate access control to the blast area. At a coal mine, a neighbor walked into the blast area and was fatally injured. The blaster could not see the victim entering the blast area from the firing station. In another case, a passenger in a vehicle was fatally injured by <b>flyrock</b> because highway traffic was not monitored during the blast. In another example, a dozer operator entered a blast area due to lack of access control. Several fatalities resulted from using inadequate or no blasting shelter.

40|$|Most {{blasting}} operations {{are associated with}} various forms of energy loss, emerging as environmental side effects of rock blasting, such as <b>flyrock,</b> vibration, airblast, and backbreak. Backbreak is an adverse phenomenon in rock {{blasting operations}}, which imposes risk and increases operation expenses because of safety reduction due to the instability of walls, poor fragmentation, and uneven burden in subsequent blasts. In this paper, based on the basic concepts of a rock engineering systems (RES) approach, a new model for the prediction of backbreak and the risk associated with a blast is presented. The newly suggested model involves 16 effective parameters on backbreak due to blasting, while retaining simplicity as well. The data for 30 blasts, carried out at Sungun copper mine, western Iran, were used to predict backbreak {{and the level of}} risk corresponding to each blast by the RES-based model. The results obtained were compared with the backbreak measured for each blast, which showed that the level of risk achieved is in consistence with the backbreak measured. The maximum level of risk [vulnerability index (VI) = 60] was associated with blast No. 2, for which the corresponding average backbreak was the highest achieved (9. 25 m). Also, for blasts with levels of risk under 40, the minimum average backbreaks...|$|E
40|$|The many {{attempts}} {{in recent years}} to develop non-explosive rock excavation techniques have used mechanical, hydraulic or gas pressurization approaches to exploit rock weakness in tension. The use of high-pressure foam to initiate, pressurize and propagate controlled fracturing in rock has been found to offer many advantages that have {{led to the development of}} a new technique. In the Controlled Foam Injection (CFI) method a viscous foam is injected into the bottom of a pre-drilled hole in the rock to be broken by means of a barrel incorporating an inexpensive and highly effective hole-bottom sealing method. Pressures needed to break rock with the CFI method are significantly less than are required in methods based upon the use of small explosive or propellant charges. The ability to tailor the viscosity and the stored gas energy of the foam to specific rock breakage characteristics results in highly controlled and predictable breakage. Airblast and <b>flyrock</b> are reduced to very benign levels, allowing the method to be applied in a continuous manner and in close proximity to personnel and equipment. The benign operating environment, the incremental breakage and the mobility and simplicity of the requisite hardware allow the method to be highly automated and fully integrated with other excavatio...|$|E
40|$|All {{activities}} {{of an organization}} involve risks that should be managed. The risk management process aids decision making by taking account of uncertainty {{and the possibility of}} future events or circumstances (intended or unintended) and their effects on agreed objectives. With that idea, new ISO Standard has been drawn up. ISO 31010 has been recently issued which provides a structured process that identifies how objectives may be affected, and analyses the risk in term of consequences and their probabilities before deciding on whether further treatment is required. In this lecture, that ISO Standard has been adapted to Open Pit Blasting Operations, focusing in Environmental effects which can be managed properly. Technique used is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), which is applied in all possible scenarios, providing to Blasting Professionals the tools to identify, analyze and manage environmental effects in blasting operations. Also this lecture can help to minimize each effect, studying each case. This paper also can be useful to Project Managers and Occupational Health and Safety Departments (OH&S) because blasting operations can be evaluated and compared one to each other to determine the risks that should be managed in different case studies. The environmental effects studied are: ground vibrations, <b>flyrock</b> and air overpressure (airblast). Sometimes, blasting operations are carried out near populated areas where environmental effects may impose several limitations on the use of explosives. In those cases, where these factors approach certain limits, National Standards and Regulations have to be applied...|$|E
