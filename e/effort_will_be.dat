Addresses in the Milton section of the township are classified under the Oak Ridge mailing city, which is shared with a portion of West Milford Township, or in the Newfoundland mailing area, shared with a portion of West Milford and Rockaway Township. Addresses in Lake Hopatcong use either Lake Hopatcong (not {{to be confused with}} the Hopatcong mailing city used in the Borough of Hopatcong) or Wharton as their mailing city. In 2016, there was an effort to change the mailing address for the Lake Shawnee section of town from a Wharton, NJ 07885 ZIP code, to a Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849 ZIP code. The effort was narrowly defeated. In 2026, a new <b>effort</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> made to change the mailing address ZIP code to Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849. The Jefferson Township Municipal Building, Middle School, High School, Recycling Center and school bus depot are positioned at the boundary between the two halves of the township.|$|E

In 1940, Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles, then chief of naval staff, led a group of RNCC alumni who met with Angus Lewis Macdonald, then naval minister to discuss opening a college to train naval officers for the postwar navy and for civilian employment in the merchant marine. The college was to be similar to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and to the former RNCC. In 1940, Angus Lewis Macdonald explained to the House of Commons [...] "it will be a proud day for this country, when our Canadian naval <b>effort</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> directed by Canadian men, trained in Canada and operating in ships built in this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The wide-spread {{interest}} in the very remarkable specimen of the giant squid, now lying on the beach a few miles below the city, is mainly due to its enormous size. It {{is believed to be}} the largest specimen ever found. Its great size and immense weight have thus far prevented its being moved for a more careful examination. A dozen men with blocks and tackle not being able even to turn it over. Another <b>effort</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> made with more extensive apparatus by which it is hoped to drag it from the pit in which it now lies and placing it higher up on the beach so that a careful and thorough examination in the interest of science can be made and the exact species determined. Professor Verrill of Yale and Profs. True and Dale [...] of the Smithsonian are in constant correspondence with Dr. DeWitt Webb, President of the St. Augustine Scientific, Literary and Historical Society, in regard to it. Several photographs have been taken of it, but owing to its position, these have not been satisfactory. Mrs. John L. Wilson believes it to belong to an extinct species. Its hide is three and a half inches thick and its head is covered by a hood that prevents examination. Apparently it is a mass of cartilage and may have been dead in the water many days before it washed ashore on Anastasia Island.|$|E
2500|$|The maquis {{bands that}} emerged in the {{countryside}} soon formed a sub-culture with its own slang, way of dressing and rules. The most important maquis rule was the so-called [...] "24 hour rule", under which a captured maquisard had to hold out under torture for 24 hours before giving up information to his captors in order to give time for his comrades to escape. An underground pamphlet written for young men considering joining the maquis advised: [...] "Men who come to the Maquis to fight live badly, in precarious fashion, with food hard to find. They will be absolutely cut off from their families for the duration; the enemy does not apply the rules of war to them; they cannot be assured any pay; every <b>effort</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> made to help their families, but it is impossible to give any guarantee in this manner; all correspondence is forbidden.Bring two shirts, two pairs of underpants, two pairs of woollen socks; a light sweater, a scarf, a heavy sweater, a woollen blanket, an extra a pair of shoes, shoelaces, needles, thread, buttons, safety pins, soap, a canteen, a knife and fork, a torch, a compass, a weapon if possible, and also a sleeping bag if possible. Wear a warm suit, a beret, a raincoat, a good pair of hobnailed boots". Another pamphlet written for the maquis advised: [...] "A maquisard should stay only where he can see without being seen. He should never live, eat, sleep except surrounded by look-outs. It should never be possible to take him by surprise.A maquisard should be mobile. When a census or enlistment [...] brings new elements he has no means of knowing into his group, he should get out. When one of the members deserts, he should get out immediately. The man could be a traitor.Réfractaires, it is not your duty to die uselessly". One maquisard recalled his first night out in the wildness: [...] "Darkness falls in the forest. On one path, some distance from the our camp, two boys stand guard over the safety of their comrades. One has a pistol, the other a service rifle, with a few spare cartridges in a box. Their watch lasts for two hours. How amazing those hours on duty in the forest at night are! Noises come from everywhere and the pale light of the moon gives everything a queer aspect. The boy looks at a small tree and think he see it move. A lorry passes on a distant road; could it be the Germans? [...] [...] [...] Are they going to stop?" [...] Oubsy stated that the [...] "breathless prose" [...] in which this maqusiard remembered his first night out in the forest was very typical of the maqusiards whose main traits were their innocence and naivety as many seemed not to understand just precisely who they were taking on or what they were getting themselves into by fleeing to the countryside.|$|E

Though, {{up to a certain}} point, it is well for the qualifying clauses of a period to precede those qualified; yet, as carrying forward each qualifying clause costs some mental effort, it follows that when the number of them and the time they are carried become great, we reach a limit beyond which more is lost than is gained. Other things equal, the arrangement should be such that no concrete image shall be suggested until the materials out of which it is to be made have been presented. And yet, as lately pointed out, other things equal, the fewer the materials to be held at once, and the shorter the distance they have to be borne, the better.
