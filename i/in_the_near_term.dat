5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> <b>term,</b> and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> <b>term</b> due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making.

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender).

The status of the relevant nuclear and hydrogen technologies are discussed and how they are coupled to bring about a transition to a nuclear/hydrogen system. Should the world adopt such a system then the growth rate of nuclear energy would greatly accelerate.
