5|$|In {{the final}} panel of this {{sequence}} Michelangelo combines two contrasting scenes into one panel, that of Adam and Eve taking fru{{it from the}} forbidden tree, Eve trustingly taking it from {{the hand of the}} Serpent and Adam eagerly picking it for himself; and their banishment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden, where they have lived in the company of God, to the world outside where they have to fend for themselves and experience death.|$|E

5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden.|$|E

5|$|The Close {{owes its}} origins to {{a grant of}} land and {{buildings}} by Walter de Hulle, a canon of Wells Cathedral, {{for the purpose of}} accommodating chantry priests; however the land is likely to have been used for a long period before the construction of the close, as prehistoric flint flakes and Romano-British pottery shards were recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> of number four during work to construct an extension.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed timber and plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings {{on the exterior}} and interior doorways, including angels, the biblical characters of Adam, Eve and the serpent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden, as well as dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed {{the push}} for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} PIP stretch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E

5|$|The Victorian garden {{had been}} planted with {{conifers}} and rhododendrons which were {{typical of the}} period. The Churchills removed much of this planting, while retaining the woodlands beyond. Within the garden proper, they created {{almost all of the}} landscape, architectural and water features seen today. The garden front of the house opens onto a terraced lawn, originally separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> beyond by a ha-ha and subsequently by a Kentish ragstone wall constructed in the 1950s. To the north lies the Rose garden, laid out by Lady Churchill and her cousin, Venetia Stanley. The nearby Marlborough Pavilion was built by Tilden and decorated with frescos by Churchill's nephew, John Spencer Churchill in 1949. Beyond the Rose Garden is the Water Garden, constructed by the Churchills and including the Golden Orfe pond where Churchill fed his fish, and the swimming pool constructed in the 1930s. Churchill sought advice from his friend and scientific guru Professor Lindemann on the optimal methods for heating and cleaning the pool.|$|E
