[Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the effect of {{sideways}} treadmill training with and without visual blocking on the balance and gait function of patients with brain lesions. [Subjects] Twenty-four stroke and traumatic brain injury subjects participated in this study. They were divided into two groups: an experimental group (12 subjects) and a control group (12 subjects). [Methods] Each group executed a treadmill training session for 20 minutes, three times a week, for 6 weeks. The sideways gait training on the treadmill was performed with visual blocking by the experimental group and with normal vision by the control group. A Biodex Gait Trainer 2 was used to assess the gait function. It was used to measure walking speed, walking <b>distance,</b> <b>step</b> length, and stance time on each foot. The Five-Times-Sit-To-Stand test (FTSST) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were used as balance measures. [Results] The sideways gait training with visual blocking group showed significantly improved walk-ing speed, walking <b>distance,</b> <b>step</b> length, and stance time on each foot after training; FTSST and TUG times also significantly improved after training in the experimental group.

40|$|To {{successfully}} perform everyday behaviors, {{people must}} be able to perceive affordances. Two general categories of affordances have been investigated: body-scaled affordances depend on geometric properties (e. g., arm length) and action-scaled affordances depend on dynamic properties (e. g., maximum running speed, body compressibility, etc.). The fact that these affordances depend on different kinds of relationships between animal and environment, suggests that body scaled affordances and action scaled affordances may be qualitatively different. We investigated this hypothesis by using a transfer of calibration paradigm. In particular, we investigated whether improvements in perception of maximum stepping distance (a body scaled affordance) transferred to perception of maximum leaping distance (an action scaled affordance), and vice versa. Participants reported maximum stepping and leaping distances in three different phases: a pre-test, practice session, and a post-test. In the practice session, half of the participants practiced performing a maximum <b>distance</b> <b>step</b> or leap, and half did not practice performing either behavior. The results showed that practice performing a maximum distance leap improved perception of maximum leaping distance and maximum stepping distance. Practice performing a maximum <b>distance</b> <b>step</b> brought about no changes in perception of maximum leaping or stepping distance. Such results suggest that body-scaled affordances and action-scaled affordances may be related hierarchically. In other words, it is likely that all body scaled affordances are action scaled affordances, but not vice versa...|$|E

It is desirable to reduce fuel consumption to reduce both pollution and flight costs.

The purpose of this study was to compare the spatiotemporal parameters of gait in genetically obese DS children and non-genetically obese children and compare their results with those obtained in a group of normal-weight control subjects. Fifteen patients with DS, 15 obese matched children and 15 healthy subjects from both sexes represented the sample of this study. Their age ranged from 12 to 14 years. Spatiotemporal gait parameters (total <b>distance,</b> <b>step</b> length, average step cycle, and walking speed) were assessed by using a Biodex Gait Trainer 2 ™. Obese DS patients walked slower for a short distance, had a shorter step length and a lower cadence compared with both matched non-genetically obese and healthy subjects. Also, non-genetically obese matched children showed spatio-temporal gait parameters significantly different from healthy subjects. Subjects with DS had a gait pattern significantly different from obese children despite that both groups had a similar body mass index (BMI). Gait abnormalities in children with DS may be related to abnormalities in the development of motor skills in childhood, due to precocious obesity.

40|$|Data sets with a {{large number}} of nominal variables, some with high cardinality, are {{becoming}} increasingly common and need to be explored. Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration displays are designed to handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with nominal values into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are rather simplistic. Often, techniques that map nominal values to numbers do not assign order or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships. Moreover, displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinality variables well. This paper addresses {{the problem of how to}} display nominal variables in general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric variables. Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing among the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct values to display. We propose that nominal variables be preprocessed using a Distance-Quantification-Classing (DQC) approach before being imported into a visual exploration tool. In the <b>Distance</b> <b>Step,</b> we identify a set of independent dimensions that can be used to calculate the distance between nominal values. In the Quantification Step, we use the independent dimensions and the distance information to assign order and spacing among the nominal values. In the Classing Step, we use results from the previous steps to determine which values within a variable are similar to each other and thus can be grouped together. Each step in the DQC approach can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. We extended the XmdvTool package to incorporate this approach.

40|$|The {{long-haul}} {{flights of}} airlines are {{impacted by the}} en-route wind fields. Flights on the same route with different directions may have significantly different flight performances. It may benefit to airlines in terms of fuel cost and on-time performance if the optimal long-haul routes are able to plan. However, the wind direction and strength are varying in different regions, at different altitudes and different times. It is difficult to identify the most suitable trajectory in a complex wind field. Consequently, the trajectory optimization problem is proposed. The main goal {{of this study is}} to develop an optimization model to identify the near optimal trajectory with minimum consumption for long-haul flights taking into account en-route winds and a set of constraints based on ATC regulations. One of the methods to solve the problem is the genetic algorithm since it is a global search method. For this purpose the software tool NSGA is applied in this study. However, the computational process of NSGA is not very efficient due to the computational loss for infeasible solutions. In order to overcome the computational inefficiency of NSGA, a 2 -phase approach is proposed. Phase 1 is to reduce the search scope for Phase 2, while the outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions with the accurate fuel consumption and flight time of the trajectories. Moreover, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to minimize the number of infeasible solutions and the control parameters. The control variables of Phase 1 are the coordinates of waypoints, true airspeeds of segments, distances of vertical segments, and the altitude changing locations. Infeasible solutions may be generated with excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations. In order maintain the feasibility of evaluated solutions, an algorithm is introduced to locate the latitude feasible range of each waypoint. Additionally, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to ensure that the evaluated trajectories terminate at the city pair. By applying these approaches, the number of infeasible solutions due to the excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations is significantly reduced. Although the approaches proposed are able to reduce the number of the control parameters, long computational time is still required to evaluate each solution with a small time or <b>distance</b> <b>step.</b> In order to increase the computational speed, the equivalent wind speed and equivalent weight concepts are proposed in Phase 1. By applying this approach, the <b>distance</b> <b>step</b> is able to increase to a segment distance. The computational efficiency is increased. The outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions. With the involved climbing and descent phases, the number of parameters in Phase 2 is more than the number of parameters in Phase 1. The search scope of Phase 2 is based on the outcomes of Phase 1 to obtain detailed solution within an acceptable computational time. In this study, the forward simulation is applied to ensure the feasibility of the flight altitude. However, the constant landing weight is hardly achieved by applying this algorithm. The transport losses may occur if there is fuel left when the aircraft arrives at the destination. In order to solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed to adjust the initial take-off weight if the final landing weight is not within the expected range. The verification in this study shows that the designed tool is quality and credible. The tool is able to detect the tailwind and headwind in a real wind field. The outcomes of the tool are a little deviated to the optimal solution, but the deviation is acceptable after analysing. In this study, three routes are researched, which are Amsterdam and New York, Amsterdam and Johannesburg, Amsterdam and Singapore. The average saving in terms of flight time and fuel consumption of the optimized solutions are 3. 16 % and 3. 1 % respectively compared to the solutions with the great circle path and optimized vertical profile. The results achieved in this study are promising, but enhancements can be made in the some areas. The optimization processes discussed in this study were only performed for one type of aircraft. More aircraft models can be analysed to further prove the performance of the designed tool. The current program assumes a standard atmosphere. As the pressure and temperature are of great influence on both the air density which further impacts the performance of the engine. A more elaborate atmospheric model could be introduced to obtain more accurate solutions. The tool designed in this study is based on Matlab. With more efficient software, the computational time can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, the use of a better equipped computer with multi processers will significantly increase the computational efficiency. In addition, well-designed termination criterions are recommended when there are multi closed local optimal solutions in the search space, which will increase the computational efficiency during the optimization process.

Recordings were performed in seven dairy farms (four for cattle and three for buffaloes). For each farm 30 - 40 animals (15 - 20 primiparous and 15 - 20 multiparous) at a lactation stage of 100 - 160 days were selected. Observations were conducted by a team of 8 trained assessors. The animals were observed in three occasions at 3 week intervals. Each animal was always assessed by the same observer. The variables collected for each animal were the following: behaviour during milking (stepping and kicking from the attachment to the removal of cups); avoidance distance (distance between the observer and the point at which the cow moved); lameness (score ranging from 0 - not lame - to 3 - very lame); cleanliness (the pelvis was divided into five areas and rated on a scale with 0 : clean and 2 : very dirty). For each farm and each variable repeatability was computed using the Kendall coefficient of concordance (W). A ratio between the variance of the animal and the sum of the latter with the error variance was also calculated using a model with one factor (animal), to have a further measure of the precision of observations.
