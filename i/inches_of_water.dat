This rainfall smashed all-time rainfall records in a 24-hour period (most {{of the rain}} fell in a 6 to 8hour-period). Ottawa's O-Train Trillium Line was halted because of a landslide that obstructed the railroad corridor. Several major roads in Gatineau and Ottawa were under several <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> locally chest-high.

5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E

5000|$|As an aside, {{the square}} inch may seem an odd measure <b>of</b> <b>water</b> power. Rights to running water were so {{expressed}} in {{a large proportion of}} old deeds.

Finally, imagine cutting a hole in the bulkhead whose cross-sectional area is a given number <b>of</b> square <b>inches</b> to let water pass through the bulkhead and proceed onto the mill. Hale cites a legal case that defined a square <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> power as follows: “A square <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> under a given head is the quantity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that under the given head will flow in a stream having a section <b>of</b> one <b>inch</b> square, the discharge being made freely into the air, the head measured above the center of the orifice and section of the stream measured where it is the smallest.” ...|$|R

25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 {{delayed the}} {{inevitable}} war between Britain and Germany. Munich {{also led to}} many changes in Imperial General Staff policies, among which was the acceptance of a proposal in November from the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre (ISTDC) at Fort Cumberland for amphibious assault procedures and for {{a new type of}} landing craft. Up to this time the Landing Craft Committee had produced some Motor Landing Craft but had not formed procedures for the assault role of these boats. Now there were specifications for what the new boat must be able to do. It must weigh less than ten long tons, enabling lifting by passenger liner davits. The new craft also had to be built around the load - apart from crew it should carry the thirty-one men of a British Army platoon and five assault engineers or signallers – and be so shallow drafted as to be able to land them, wet only up to their knees, in eighteen <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The troops had to unload quickly. All of these specifications made the LCA personnel carriers; a separate set of requirements were laid down for a vehicle and supplies carrier, although previously the two roles were combined in the Motor Landing Craft.|$|E
