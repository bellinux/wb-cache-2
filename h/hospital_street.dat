5|$|Churche's Mansion is a timber-framed, {{black-and-white}} Elizabethan mansion {{house at}} {{the eastern end of}} <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> in Nantwich, Cheshire, England. The GradeI listed building dates from 1577, {{and is one of the}} very few to have survived the Great Fire of Nantwich in 1583.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} laid out around a large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the buttery and kitchen to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> was {{the main}} road between London and Chester; the medieval St Nicholas Hospital, which gave the street its name, {{remained}} in use until 1548. Sweetbriar Hall would originally have stood at {{the eastern edge of}} the town. The north side of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street,</b> where Sweetbriar Hall is located, was only sparsely occupied in the Tudor era; the south side of the street was marshy and little built on. Much of the area north of the hall between <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> and Beam Street was owned by Combermere Abbey until its dissolution in 1538, being used as orchards, fields and gardens; it remained largely gardens and crofts when the first map of Nantwich was drawn in 1794. Other early buildings at the eastern end of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> include number 116, a house of Georgian appearance on the south side, which incorporates a substantially older timber-framed house, parts of which have been dated to the late 15th century.|$|E
25|$|After the Methodist Union in 1932, the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> church {{became one}} of several Methodist places of worship in Nantwich. In 1966, it merged with the Pillory Street Methodist Chapel and the Wood Memorial Chapel on The Barony to form the Central Methodist Church of Nantwich, which worshipped at the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> church. In 2000, the Welsh Row Chapel also merged into the Central Methodist Church to form Nantwich Methodist Church.|$|E
25|$|According to some sources, the {{scientist}} and philosopher Joseph Priestley lived at Sweetbriar Hall {{while he was}} in Nantwich in 1758–61. A red-brick former school {{at the rear of the}} hall dating from around 1701 has also been identified as Priestley's house. He was the minister of a Unitarian chapel, now demolished, which stood on the corner of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> and Pratchett's Row, and also established a school in an adjacent building on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1835, a split {{occurred}} and several congregation members were expelled; they formed the Wesleyan Methodist Association, which met on Castle Street. In the mid-19th century, the several other Nonconformist {{places of worship}} in the town also included a Primitive Methodist Chapel on Welsh Row, a Unitarian Chapel on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street,</b> an Independent or Congregational Chapel on Monks Lane, a Baptist Chapel on Barker Street, and a Friends' Meeting House on Pillory Street.|$|E
25|$|An {{elementary}} {{day school}} {{was constructed in}} 1840 on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street,</b> opposite the church, which also doubled as the Sunday school; by 1873 it was teaching {{both boys and girls}} to read. On 3 January 1908, the school burned down and was replaced with the existing building, which opened on 27 September 1909 at a cost of £2,000, raised by the local circuit. The new building was used as a Sunday school rather than a day school.|$|E

25|$|Rapid growth {{took place}} in the {{subsequent}} few decades, with the congregation reaching 200 by 1806. The society then purchased a site on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> for £700, on which they built a church and two preachers' houses, at a cost of £3,300. The Wesleyan Methodist Church opened on 13 November 1808, and seated a congregation of around 900. Originally included in the Chester Methodist circuit, in 1808 Nantwich became the centre of a circuit which included Alsager, Bickerton, Buerton and Winsford, and, until 1869, the new town of Crewe.|$|E
25|$|The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel of Nantwich in Cheshire {{was seeking}} a {{headmaster}} in 1866 for its elementary Day School to succeed the retiring Mr Mobbs; they required an incumbent who could also play the organ at the chapel. Twenty-years old Hall was appointed, {{and took up}} the position on 7 January 1867. He was {{to spend the rest}} of his life in Cheshire. The school had been founded in 1840, and stood on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street,</b> opposite the chapel. In 1873, during Hall's time there, subjects taught included religion and reading, and both boys and girls attended. The present building on the site dates from 1909; the old school burned down in January 1908.|$|E
25|$|A house {{stood on}} this site {{before the fire}} of 1583, {{probably}} built for Thomas Churche (or Church), a mercer or linen merchant. The Churche family numbered among the town's gentry during the 15–17th centuries, and Thomas was the nephew of Richard Churche, a wealthy merchant for whom Churche's Mansion on nearby <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> was built. In common with {{almost all of the}} town east of the River Weaver, the house was destroyed in the fire of 1583. It was rebuilt shortly afterwards, probably in 1584, at a cost of £120, of which £20 came from the town rebuilding fund. After the rebuilding, the adjacent house (now 42–44 High Street) was owned by Richard Churche's son, William, who was also in the linen trade.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} {{eight or ten}} lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows are believed to date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern shop windows to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High Street, number 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses soffit tenons with diminished haunch, a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Ximenez-Fatio House Museum {{is one of}} the best-preserved {{and most}} {{authentic}} Second Spanish Period (1783-1821) residential buildings in St. Augustine, Florida. In 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was designated a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2012. The museum complex sits just south of the city's central Plaza de la Constitución at 20 Aviles Street (formerly <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street),</b> the oldest archaeologically documented street in the United States. It is located at the center of Old Town, the city's oldest continuously occupied community. Since 1939, the property has been privately owned and managed by The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in The State of Florida (NSCDA-FL). Through their efforts, it was restored and interpreted to reflect its function as a fashionable boarding house during Florida's first tourist boom, which began after 1821. The property is a historic house museum, furnished and presented to tell stories of the visitors who lodged there, the women who owned and managed it, and how people lived during Florida's territorial period.|$|E
25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{to the front}} façade {{and half of the}} west (left) side {{features}} decorative framing, made up of small panels containing ornamental devices. Patterns include chevron bracing with middle rails, often inverted, which forms herringbone patterns and diamonds. This type of decoration is typical of early Elizabethan work (mid-16th century) and is also seen at Little Moreton Hall (c.1504–1610). Curved braces forming concave-sided diamonds are also present; this is a common motif in Cheshire, also seen at Churche's Mansion, Chorley Old Hall and Blackden Hall. The ornamental panelling is not carried {{to the rear of the}} west face, presumably for cost reasons. Close studding with a middle rail is used on the back half of the west face, as well as parts of the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> façade. This mix of decorative framing with close studding is unusual in Nantwich; other examples are Churche's Mansion and two houses built after the fire, 46 High Street and 3 Church Lane. The rear of the building has small framing.|$|E

500|$|Standing on {{the edge}} of the old town, the {{recently}} completed Churche's Mansion survived the fire of 1583 which destroyed almost all of Nantwich east of the River Weaver. The only other buildings known to have survived were Sweetbriar Hall, also on <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street,</b> and the parish church. Richard Churche willed [...] "the house ... wherein I now dwell on the Ospell Street" [...] to his second son, Rondull, Randol or Randle Church(e). The house is mentioned among the principal houses of the town in a 1622/3 account by William Webb, who describes the mansion as [...] "a fair timber-house of Mr. Randol Church, a gentleman of singular integrity." [...] Randle Church survived until 1648, outliving his son and grandson, and Churche's Mansion then passed to the Shropshire branch of the family, descended from Richard Churche's eldest son, William. The Churche family inhabited the house until at least 1691, when a rate book records Saboth Church as the resident and gives the rates as 2 shillings 8½ pence.|$|E
500|$|The New Orleans house {{occupied}} by Delphine LaLaurie {{at the time}} of the 1834 fires stands today at 1140 Royal Street, on the corner of Royal Street and Governor Nicholls Street (formerly known as <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street).</b> At three stories high, it was described in 1928 as [...] "the highest building for squares around", with the result that [...] "from the cupola on the roof one may look out over the Vieux Carré and see the Mississippi in its crescent before Jackson Square". [...] The entrance to the building bears iron grillwork, and the door is carved with an image of [...] "Phoebus in his chariot, and with wreaths of flowers and depending garlands in bas-relief". [...] Inside, the vestibule is floored in black and white marble, and a curved mahogany-railed staircase runs the full three stories of the building. [...] The second floor holds three large drawing rooms connected by ornamented sliding doors, whose walls are decorated with plaster rosettes, carved woodwork, black marble mantle pieces and fluted pilasters.|$|E
500|$|After {{traversing}} {{the northern}} part of Lac La Biche County and entering the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Highway63 reaches an intersection with Highway881 west of Anzac, nearly [...] north of Wandering River. The highway veers slightly northwest, paralleling the Hangingstone River for the remaining [...] of its journey to an access for Fort McMurray International Airport at Airport Road (formerly Highway69), and the southern limit of Fort McMurray. [...] In Fort McMurray, Highway63 continues as a divided expressway along the east bank of the Hangingstone River through the communities of Gregoire and Beacon Hill. [...] It then adopts the name Memorial Drive, curving slightly east and then back north before descending to cross the river after a diamond interchange at Prairie Loop Boulevard. Climbing from the Hangingstone River, a second diamond interchange at <b>Hospital</b> <b>Street</b> follows as the four lanes of Highway63 bypass downtown Fort McMurray to the west, separating it from the neighbourhoods of Hilltop Estates and Aspen Gardens. [...] The highway then turns west to cross the Athabasca River on three bridges. [...] The northernmost bridge, the Athabasca River Bridge, carries three through lanes and two lanes from Franklin Avenue that eventually merge into the main northbound lanes {{on the west side of}} the river. [...] The Ralph Steinhauer Bridge is in the centre, carrying the three main eastbound lanes. [...] The Grant MacEwan Bridge is the southernmost crossing; it carries two lanes of eastbound traffic exiting from Highway63 to Franklin Avenue and C.A.Knight Way downtown. [...] On the river's east bank, the two lanes from the MacEwan descend into a short tunnel under the northern bridges to reach Franklin Avenue.|$|E
