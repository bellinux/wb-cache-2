5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm). This structure means that chlorine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low.</b> Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{invasive}} risk stratification (with PES) is necessary in the asymptomatic individual. While some groups advocate PES for risk stratification in all individuals under 35 years old, others only offer it to individuals who have history suggestive of a tachydysrhythmia, since the incidence of sudden cardiac death <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> (less than 0.6% in some reports).|$|E
25|$|Only five {{laminations}} or {{plates are}} shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.|$|E

25|$|Electrostatic {{stabilization}} {{is based}} on the mutual repulsion of like electrical charges. In general, different phases have different charge affinities, so that an electrical double layer forms at any interface. Small particle sizes lead to enormous surface areas, and this effect is greatly amplified in colloids. In a stable colloid, mass of a dispersed phase <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that its buoyancy or kinetic energy is too weak to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between charged layers of the dispersing phase.|$|E

Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely anemic dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for ehrlichiosis {{involves the use of}} antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of at least six to eight weeks; response to the drugs may take one month. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and azithromycin is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that the condition is life-threatening.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{extremely}} rare p-p IV branch. Other even-rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or {{because the number of}} reacting particles <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant. This is partly why no mass-5 or mass-8 elements are seen. While the reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei coming together to form beryllium-8, may actually happen, these elements are not detected because there are no stable isotopes of atomic masses 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the canal}} {{nominally}} crosses the watersheds of five river systems, {{in reality the}} variation between these <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that it has only a single summit section. The elevation of the canal bed varies from 1 m below sea level at Hangzhou to 38.5 m above at its summit. At Beijing it reaches 27 m, fed by streams flowing downhill from {{the mountains to the}} west. The water flows from Beijing toward Tianjin, from Nanwang north toward Tianjin, and from Nanwang south toward Yangzhou. The water level in the Jiangnan Canal remains scarcely above sea level (the Zhenjiang ridge is 12 meters higher than the Yangzi River).|$|E
25|$|Spamming remains {{economically}} viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond {{the management of}} their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, {{and it is difficult}} to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|A metamaterial-based device {{wirelessly}} converts a 900MHz microwave {{signal to}} 7.3 volts of direct current (greater {{than that of}} a USB device). The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even sound signals. The experimental device used a series of five fiberglass and copper conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other. But since RF power goes down by the cube of the distance, the amount of power is very very small. While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> there can be almost no current when any load is attached.|$|E
500|$|Prank {{exploding}} cigars {{have caused}} many injuries over their history. For example, in 1902 one Edward Weinschreider sued a cigar shop for an exploding cigar which burned his hand so badly {{three of his}} fingers had to be amputated. As has been observed by one legal scholar, [...] "he utility of the exploding cigar <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> {{and the risk of}} injury so high as to warrant a conclusion that the cigar is defective and should not have been marketed at all." [...] Laws have been enacted banning the sale of exploding cigars entirely, such as Chapter 178 of Massachusetts' Acts and Resolves, passed by its legislature in 1967.|$|E
