5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have <b>expedited</b> processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved <b>expedited</b> permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E

40|$|In recent supply chains, often {{operating}} {{multiple delivery}} modes such as standard freight shipping and air {{is an effective}} way of addressing both delivery lead time uncertainties and service rates. We propose a model on how to optimally operate multiple delivery modes. We consider a serial supply chain and an <b>expediting</b> option from intermediate installations to the downstream of the chain. The goods move stochastically among the installations and the system faces a stochastic demand. We identify systems that yield simple optimal policies, in which both regular ordering and <b>expediting</b> follow {{a variant of the}} base stock policy. <b>Expediting</b> allows the system to be leaner due to the reduced regular order amount. In addition, we provide managerial insights linking <b>expediting,</b> base stock levels, and <b>expediting</b> costs based on analytical and numerical results...|$|R

40|$|In modern global supply chains, goods travel stochastically from {{suppliers}} to their final destinations through several intermediate installations such as ports and distribution facilities. In such an environment, {{the supply chain}} must be agile to respond quickly to demand spikes. One way to achieve this objective is by <b>expediting</b> outstanding orders from the intermediate installations through premium delivery. In this research, we study the optimal <b>expediting</b> and regular ordering policies of a serial supply chain with a radio frequency identification deployment at each installation. Radio frequency identification technology allows capturing {{the state of the}} system, i. e., the time and location of goods, at any point in time, and thus enables to <b>expedite</b> outstanding orders directly to the destination, which faces stochastic demand. We identify systems, called sequential, that yield simple and tractable optimal policies. For sequential systems, outstanding orders including <b>expediting</b> do not cross in time. For such systems, we find that the optimal policies of <b>expediting</b> and regular ordering are the base stock type policies. The directional sensitivity of the base stock levels with respect to <b>expediting</b> costs is also obtained. We provide an important managerial insight on the radio frequency identification technology: we need to actively use the additional information from the radio frequency identification technology through new business processes such as <b>expediting</b> to unveil more benefits from the supply chain. On the other hand, orders may cross in time for systems that are not sequential, thus in such a case optimal policies are hard to obtain. We propose a heuristic for such systems and discuss its performance and limitation. (cont.) Lastly, as an extension to the model, we study the optimal policies of <b>expediting</b> and regular ordering when there is an expiry date on outstanding orders. The optimal <b>expediting</b> policy identifies a number of base stock levels depending on the age of the orders, but the structure of the optimal policy remains simple for sequential systems. by Chiwon Kim.
