50|$|The TC.21/100 or Grey Lady {{announced}} 20 October 1953 {{came with}} a guarantee of a speed of 100 mph resulting from an improved exhaust system and an engine compression ratio raised from 7:1 to 8:1 {{to take advantage of}} the availability of better petrol. The final drive ratio was raised from 4.09:1 to 3.77:1. A paired <b>front</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> and matching driving lamp became a standard fitting. The bonnet gained air scoops and wire wheels were fitted to try to enliven the car's image. A heater was fitted as standard but a radio remained an expensive option.|$|E

5000|$|At the October 1953 Paris Motor Show Fiat {{launched}} a sporting {{version of the}} 103, the 1100 TV—standing for Turismo Veloce, [...] "Fast Touring". The TV was fitted with an improved engine (type 103.006), which developed [...] at 5,400 rpm rather than the [...] of the regular versions, mainly thanks to a twin-choke Weber carburettor and a higher 7.4:1 (instead of 6.7:1) compression ratio. Later in 1954, compression ratio was raised further to 7.6:1 and power reached 50 PS CUNA. Top speed was 135 km/h. Another notable mechanical difference was the propeller shaft, two-piece instead of one-piece in order to dampen torsional vibrations, intensified by the increased engine output.The TV's bodyshell, outfitted by Fiat's Carrozzerie Speciali special bodies department, differed from the standard in having a larger, curved rear window and prominent rear wings, supporting differently shaped tail lamps.A distinguishing trait of the TV was a single <b>front</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp,</b> inset in the grille and flanked by two chrome whiskers. Specific exterior trim included thicker chrome spears on the sides with [...] "1100 TV" [...] and [...] "Fiat Carrozzerie Speciali" [...] badging, a taller bonnet ornament, special hubcaps, and whitewall tyres. As standard the TV was painted in a two-tone livery, with the roof and wheel rims in a contrasting colour. Inside it featured a tortoiseshell celluloid two-spoke steering wheel, two-tone cloth and vinyl upholstery, colour-coded fully carpeted floor, and {{until the end of}} 1954 reclining buckets which could optionally be fitted instead of the standard bench seat. At 1,225,000 Italian lire (1953 price) the 1100 TV was markedly more expensive than the standard Tipo A and B saloons, priced respectively 945 and 975 thousand lire.The TV was appreciated by Fiat's more sporting clientele, who entered it in numerous races in period; its most prestigious victories include class wins at the 1954 and 1955 Mille Miglia, and an outright win at the 1954 Cape Town to Algiers trans African rally.|$|E

Finally, there is a discussion of the likely effects of current and improved <b>front</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> on driver behavior and on overall safety. The conclusions are that there is very little evidence for a safety benefit from current <b>front</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> relative to low beams, that there is little reason to expect {{that there would be a}} safety benefit even from improved lamps, and that, in terms of vehicle lighting, the most promising approach to improving safety in fog would be the use of rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamps.</b> In spite of a lack of evidence for safety benefits in <b>fog,</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are a popular optional form of forward lighting that many drivers apparently value. It may be that their main value is more as supplements to low-beam lighting for all conditions, rather than specifically in fog. Given the uncertainties in our present knowledge about how current <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> and potential new <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> affect vision and safety, it would be beneficial to learn more about those issues before adopting new standards for <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> or retiring the current standards. One approach that seems particularly important would be studies that examine the possibly complex reactions of drivers to <b>fog</b> and <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> in terms of steering behavior, speed control, and decisions about where and when to risk driving in fog. A second area would be to do a more complete analysis than has yet been done of the crash data concerning fog, perhaps focusing specifically on the issue of how fog affects road-departure crashes...|$|R
