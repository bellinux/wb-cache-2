5|$|When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur {{journalist}} for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, La Industria, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first <b>dramatic</b> <b>work,</b> La huida del Inca.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, Lutosławski {{started work}} on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez {{conducted}} the second movement, Direct, in 1966, and when the first movement, Hésitant, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony {{is very different from}} a conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, <b>dramatic</b> <b>work</b> worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the Sonning Award, Denmark's highest musical honour.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{opening night}} marked {{the climax of}} Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or <b>dramatic</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} was appealed, {{but while the}} Court of Appeal unanimously held that the content of a film (including the use of film and editing techniques) could enjoy copyright protection as a <b>dramatic</b> <b>work,</b> the presiding Justices ruled that Anticipation did not significantly copy any portion of Joy and dismissed the case.

25|$|Tourneur's primary <b>dramatic</b> <b>work</b> is The Atheist's Tragedy, or The Honest Man's Revenge {{which was}} {{published}} in 1611. A case has been made by Johan Gerritsen that Tourneur {{is the author of the}} first act of The Honest Man's Fortune (1613), a play from the Beaumont & Fletcher canon usually attributed to John Fletcher, Philip Massinger and Nathan Field. In addition there is a lost play, The Nobleman, and the lost Arraignment of London written with Robert Daborne. The Revenger's Tragedy (1607), which was once attributed to Tourneur, has now been securely reassigned to Thomas Middleton.|$|E
25|$|The {{deaths of}} Custer and his troops became the best-known {{episode in the}} history of the American Indian Wars, due in part to a {{painting}} commissioned by the brewery Anheuser-Busch as part of an advertising campaign. The enterprising company ordered reprints of a <b>dramatic</b> <b>work</b> that depicted “Custer's Last Stand” and had them framed and hung in many United States saloons. This created lasting impressions of the battle and the brewery’s products in the minds of many bar patrons. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote an adoring (and in some places, erroneous) poem. President Theodore Roosevelt's lavish praise pleased Custer's widow.|$|E

Her work is less known in English-speaking countries. However, in July and August 2012 a major English language premiere of her play Ein Sportstück by Just a Must theatre company brought her <b>dramatic</b> <b>work</b> to the attention of English-speaking audiences.

25|$|Dido and Aeneas (Z. 626) is {{an opera}} in a prologue and three acts, {{written by the}} English Baroque {{composer}} Henry Purcell with a libretto by Nahum Tate. The dates of the composition and first performance of the opera are uncertain. It was composed no later than July 1688, and had been performed at Josias Priest's girls' school in London {{by the end of}} 1689. Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683. The story is based on Book IV of Virgil's Aeneid. It recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. A monumental work in Baroque opera, Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell's foremost theatrical works. It was also Purcell's only true opera, as well as his only all-sung <b>dramatic</b> <b>work.</b> One of the earliest known English operas, it owes much to John Blow's Venus and Adonis, both in structure and in overall effect. The influence of Cavalli's opera Didone is also apparent.|$|E
25|$|Both Arcades and A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634 were masques {{commissioned}} by the family of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater through the influence of Lawes, the Earl's music tutor for his children. Arcades was written to honour Alice Spencer, Countess Dowager of Derby, and performed on her estate at Harefield west of London; the date is debated, perhaps in October 1632 as the family tried to put behind it the scandal of the execution of her son-in-law Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven for sexual offences, or on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634. A Mask was performed for Michaelmas eve, 29 September 1634, at Ludlow Castle, the Earl of Bridgewater's residence. This masque differed in some ways from other masques of the time, {{in that it was}} longer and did not rely as much on music. The text was revised and published in 1638. Milton was a theatre-goer in his youth, as he mentions in Elegy I, and his <b>dramatic</b> <b>work</b> on masques, though the genre was closely associated with court entertainments, has been seen as suggestive of a reforming rather than a negative attitude to drama, in contrast to militant critics such as William Prynne from the Puritan side.|$|E
