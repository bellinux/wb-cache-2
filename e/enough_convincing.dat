Using a convenience sampling method, 49 public school principals from Texas participated and an online survey was constructed to gather both quantitative (i. e., Likert scale) and qualitative (i. e., open ended response) data. The find-ings clearly point to principals, regardless of geographical district type and grade level school type, viewing less contro-versial and more intrinsically oriented policies (i. e., site-based management and professional development) as having a greater positive impact on outcomes as a whole than more radical alternatives (i. e., accountability and time and sched-ule reform).

40|$|The {{theory of}} Plate Tectonics helps explain many {{geological}} {{features on the}} Earth. However, ordinary horizontal plate tectonics does not explain why Africa has been rising over the past 100 million years and why Australia had an inland sea when the global sea level was low, and was dry when the global sea level was high. Research shows that subducting plates can pull other plates and continents to lower elevations with them. Continents and plates can rise in elevation if they sit on top of large hot rising regions in the mantle, or when a subducting slab loses its pull as it goes deeper into the mantle. This vertical motion is really en extension of the horizontal theory of Plate Tectonics, which evolved from Wegner’s theory of Continental Drift. Geologists view the theory of Plate Tectonics “…as the grand unifying theory of geology, because it can successfully explain a great many geologic phenomenon…(Marshak, 2001). ” The process towards validating this theory {{has a long history}} because {{it was very difficult to}} gather <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence right away.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{there is}} <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> {{evidence}} in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), {{the data on}} the pre-natal origin in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are less comprehensive. Our study aimed to screen Guthrie cards (neonatal blood spots) of non-infant childhood AML and ALL patients {{for the presence of}} their respective leukemic markers. Methods We analysed Guthrie cards of 12 ALL patients aged 2 – 6 years using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements (n = 15) and/or intronic breakpoints of TEL/AML 1 fusion gene (n = 3). In AML patients (n = 13, age 1 – 14 years) PML/RARalpha (n = 4), CBFbeta/MYH 11 (n = 3), AML 1 /ETO (n = 2), MLL/AF 6 (n = 1), MLL/AF 9 (n = 1) and MLL/AF 10 (n = 1) fusion genes and/or internal tandem duplication of FLT 3 gene (FLT 3 /ITD) (n = 2) were used as clonotypic markers. Assay sensitivity determined using serial dilutions of patient DNA into the DNA of a healthy donor allowed us to detect the pre-leukemic clone in Guthrie card providing 1 – 3 positive cells were present in the neonatal blood spot. Results In 3 patients with ALL (25 %) we reproducibly detected their leukemic markers (Ig/TCR n = 2; TEL/AML 1 n = 1) in the Guthrie card. We did not find patient-specific molecular markers in any patient with AML. Conclusion In the largest cohort examined so far we used identical approach for the backtracking of non-infant childhood ALL and AML. Our data suggest that either the prenatal origin of AML is less frequent or the load of pre-leukemic cells is significantly lower at birth in AML compared to ALL cases. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the results of}} {{examination}} and treatment of 91 patients with adrenal glands incidentaloma were analyzed. According {{to the results of}} the morphological study, adenomas were the most common (n= 60). Among malignant tumors, ACC was detected in 7 patients, low and undifferentiated cancer – in 3 patients, sarcoma – in 2 patients and metastasis of cancer – in 4 patients. To assess the nature of the tumor, the following criteria were used: size and density according to CT. In 43 patients with neoplasms less than 4 cm in 9, 3 % of cases malignant adrenalomas occurred, at 4 - 6 cm (n= 29) - in 17, 2 % of cases, more than 6 cm (n= 19) - in 31, 6 %. In patients with ACC, 71, 4 % of tumors exceeded 6 cm, 28, 5 % - were within 4 - 6 cm, 14, 1 % - less than 4 cm. The frequency of detection of malignant incidentalomas increases in proportion to the growth of tumor size, and with a diameter of more than 4 cm it was 27, 1 %. Adrenal adenomas in 31. 6 % of cases were from 4 to 6 cm, and in 10 % - more than 6 cm. Thus, the orientation only on the size of tumors did not provide <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> grounds for determining its malignant potential.

30|$|The {{national}} civic turn {{belongs to}} this post-M era. 1 Why does this post-M framework emphasize {{the view of}} considering national identity as a friend rather than a foe? Because {{there is a certain}} shared view that the MCP has exaggerated the rights-based approach to the detriment of duties. And these duties towards immigrants must also be placed at the same level of policy consideration, because they can help to regulate the excessive recognition to certain cultures, and limit illiberal practices contravening human rights. In practical terms, the duties-based approach calls for development of the means to ensure civic practices and citizenship as well as a minimum level of competence in the national language and a minimum level of knowledge about the country’s history and society. In normative terms, it seeks to ensure a minimum threshold for living together in a common public culture. It is true that this civic turn can have many readings, depending on how one sets this minimum threshold and if one makes it voluntary or compulsory. In European terms, taking care not to erode Unity by being “too diverse”, to use Goodhart’s (2004) terms, means reevaluating national identity, language and democratic liberal values as limiters rather than promoters of multiculturalism. There is however in this new civic national narrative a problem, which was already visible in the multicultural approach: they both still consider diversity as “the other” that is separated from the mainstream, instead of placing diversity within the mainstream. The question today is no longer how to live with diversity but how to live in diversity (Antonsich, 2016, p. 470). The growing diversity scenarios compounding our societies today are new for everybody, whether their origins are Filipino, Pakistani. Moroccan, Chinese, Ecuadorian, French, German, Hungarian or Italian. There is a general desire to build an alternative to the extremist narrative, and neither the MCP nor the NCP narratives that are dominating this post-multicultural period provide us with <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> arguments that bridge Unity and Diversity. I would even say that this post-M period places multiculturalism under suspicion of being part of the problem needing to be dealt with.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Gender-specific {{medicine}} {{is the study}} of how diseases differ between men and women in terms of prevention, clinical signs, therapeutic approach, prognosis, psychological and social impact. It is a neglected dimension of medicine. In this review we like to point out some major issues in five enormous fields of medicine: cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), pharmacology, oncology, liver diseases and osteoporosis. CVDs have been studied in the last decades mainly in men, but they are the first cause of mortality and disability in women. Risk factors for CVD have different impacts in men and women; clinical manifestations of CVD and the influence of drugs on CVD have lot of gender differences. Sex-related differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are also emerging. These differences have obvious relevance to the efficacy and side effect profiles of various medications in the two sexes. This evidence should be considered for drug development as well as before starting any therapy. Gender disparity in cancer incidence, aggressiveness and prognosis has been observed for a variety of cancers and, even if partially known, is underestimated in clinical practice for the treatment of the major types of cancer. It is necessary to systematize and encode all the known data for each type of tumor on gender differences, to identify where this variable has to be considered {{for the purposes of the}} prognosis, the choice of treatment and possible toxicity. Clinical data suggest that men and women exhibit differences regarding the epidemiology and the progression of certain liver diseases, i. e., autoimmune conditions, genetic hemochromatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated to justify this sex imbalance including sex hormones, reproductive and genetic factors. Nevertheless, none of these hypothesis has thus far gathered <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence and in most cases the evidence is conflicting. Osteoporosis is an important public health problem both in women and men. On the whole, far more epidemiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic studies have been carried out in women than in men. In clinical practice, if this disease remains underestimated in women, patients' and physicians' awareness is even lower for male osteoporosis, for which diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are at present less defined. In conclusion this review emphasizes the urgency of basic science and clinical research to increase our understanding of the gender differences of diseases...|$|E
40|$|Od pet poznatih dubrovačkih molitvenika što sežu do prvih desetljeća 16. stoljeća tekstovno su najbliži okrnjeni rukopisni latinički Drugi vatikanski hrvatski molitvenik i Ćirilički dubrovački molitvenik tiskan u Veneciji 1512. godine. Latinički rukopisni vremenski je smještan u kraj 15. stoljeća (Fancev) i u mlađe doba, kao prijepis ćiriličkoga tiskanoga (Giannelli, Rešetar). Razmatraju se sličnosti i razlike tih dvaju tekstova, koje bi imale potvrditi ili opovrgnuti pretpostavku o prijepisu latiničkoga teksta s ćiriličkoga, odnosno ukazati na postojanje nekoga njima zajedničkoga predloška. There {{are five}} prayer books from Dubrovnik (livres d’heures type) that reach {{back to the}} first decades of the 16 th century, of which the {{following}} two would be most similar to one another: Ćirilički dubrovački molitvenik (Cyrillic prayer book from Dubrovnik), printed in Venice in the 1512 th (ĆDM) and Drugi vatikanski hrvatski molitvenik (Second Vatican Croatian prayer book), truncated manuscript written in Latin script (VHM 2). The former was published, thoroughly described and linguistically analyzed by Milan Rešetar. The latter was dated to the end of the 15 th century by Franjo Fancev. However, Rešetar’s associate Ciro Giannelli assumes (on the basis of many common errors and lacunae in ĆDM and VHM 2, and comparisons with the second Cyrillic edition from 1571) that VHM 2 was transcribed from the printed Cyrillic text. His assumption goes further to claim that the template for the transcription was not the Cyrillic prayer book printed in 1512, but the unknown one, printed in the period from 1512 until 1571. This paper questions Giannelli’s remarks on these common mistakes and lacunae of both texts as well as correspondences between the VHM 2 and the second edition of ĆDM which differ both of them from the ĆDM’s first edition. It has been shown for a number of errors and lacunae that they might be interpreted differently. It is also shown that correspondences between VHM 2 and the second edition of ĆDM are not direct in most cases. It is therefore concluded that it is difficult to find <b>enough</b> <b>convincing</b> confirmations of Giannelli’s hypothesis on the existence of an unknown Cyrillic template. Furthermore, typical prayer books’ terms, differences in prayer book compilation »techniques« and the translation differences between ĆDM and VHM 2 are analyzed and compared with other texts from Dubrovnik prayer books and psalms. The results of the analysis evidence frequent corrections of errors and lacunae in VHM 2 compared to ĆDM. All this shows that the differences among the studied texts are too significant and that there is not nearly enough evidence to claim that one text is even edited on the basis of another, let alone transcribed (copied) from it. However, one might assume their common template...|$|E
