In his historical {{role as the}} British military leader in the War for Independence, Howe was acquainted with Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) before Crane defected to America; his first major flashback appearance sees him offer Crane a chance to return to Britain if he identifies Washington's spies in the British forces, with Crane feeling guilty that he was briefly tempted by the offer. Howe also {{plays a key role}} in the crossover episodes between Sleepy Hollow and crime drama Bones; his body is discovered in a small American church in the present (characters noting that he is recorded as being buried in Twickenham), with his skull being identified as the 'murder weapon' in Bones episode [...] "The Resurrection in the Remains", and he is resurrected as a zombie-like warrior in the following Sleepy Hollow episode [...] "Dead Men Tell No Tales", requiring Crane to destroy him with Greek fire.|$|E
60|$|We {{approached}} {{within about}} twenty {{yards of the}} spot where the advanced guard had seen some appearance of an enemy. It was one of those promontories which run into the lake, and round the base of which the road had hitherto winded in the manner I have <b>described.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> case, however, the path, instead of keeping the water's edge, sealed the promontory by one or two rapid zigzags, carried in a broken track along the precipitous face of a slaty grey rock, which would otherwise have been absolutely inaccessible. On the top of this rock, only to be approached by a road so broken, so narrow, and so precarious, the corporal declared he had seen the bonnets and long-barrelled guns of several mountaineers, apparently couched among the long heath and brushwood which crested the eminence. Captain Thornton ordered him to move forward with three files, to dislodge the supposed ambuscade, while, at a more slow but steady pace, he advanced to his support {{with the rest of his}} party.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{collapse}} of Communism, Kubliński got posthumously a street named after himself in Cracow, and another one {{in the city of}} Skawina. Both streets are single-lane cul-de-sacs ending in fields, the Cracow ulica Marka Kublińskiego being about 150 metres' long, unpaved and situated {{on the outskirts of the}} peripheral district of Nowa Huta which did not exist in Kubliński's lifetime. But it is a street, with about eleven or twelve houses having the official address that incorporates Kubliński's name. There is a commemorative plaque honouring Marek Kubliński and Bohdan Różycki at the John III Sobieski High School which they attended together in Cracow.The person and the case of Marek Kubliński are treated fictionally in the 2010 book [...] a fictional autobiography [...] by the filmmaker and writer Janusz Majewski, Mała matura ("The Little School-leaving Exam"). While a work of fiction, the book is of first importance to the understanding of the background against which the events <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> article played themselves out and the atmosphere of the period. Majewski, Kubliński's peer in age, went to the same Cracow high school with Kubliński, but was in a younger class at the time and does not appear to have been personally acquainted with Kubliński. [...] "I was not a direct participant in the events", he declares in an inter&shy;view. Thus, while Majewski cannot be accepted as a trusted insider witness to the events in question, his report is valuable for the version of events circulating at the time among the generality of the school's pupils, and for the sociopolitical atmosphere of the Cracow of the period. On Christmas Eve in 2010 the newspaper Rzecz&shy;pos&shy;po&shy;li&shy;ta published an interview with Majewski on the occasion of the launch of the book, in which Majewski provided additional [...] this time unfictionalized [...] facts concerning the case of Marek Kubliński. The new facts of value to the story of Marek Kubliński are not new recollections of Majewski (who as already mentioned lacks privileged first-hand information of the case) but the information that Majewski was able to unearth during research for his 2010 book in the archives of the Cracow branch of the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej. The documents show that Kubliński's mother was allowed to spend with him in the Montelupich Prison in Cracow, the last night before his execution. Majewski comments: [...] "I do not know if this was an act of mercy or an additional punishment".|$|E

Thus for 1 ≤ p < ∞, the real Hardy space contains the Hardy space, but is much bigger, since no relationship is imposed between the real and imaginary part of the function.|$|R
