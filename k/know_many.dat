25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do <b>know</b> <b>many</b> things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E

500|$|Joshua A. Fogel, at York University, {{argued that}} the book is [...] "seriously flawed" [...] and [...] "full of {{misinformation}} and harebrained explanations." [...] He suggested that the book [...] "starts to fall apart" [...] when Chang tries {{to explain why the}} massacre took place, as she repeatedly comments on [...] "the Japanese psyche", which she sees as [...] "the historical product of centuries of conditioning that all boil down to mass murder" [...] even though in the introduction, she wrote that she would offer no [...] "commentary on the Japanese character or the genetic makeup of a people who could commit such acts". Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's [...] "lack of training as a historian" [...] and another part was [...] "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history". Fogel also writes: [...] "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we <b>know</b> <b>many</b> details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" [...] of Japanese scholars.|$|E
500|$|Katamari Forever, {{known in}} Japan as , was {{released}} for the PlayStation 3 in 2009 by Namco Bandai. The {{music for the}} game includes a number of remixed tracks from previous iterations of the series, {{using a combination of}} [...] "electric" [...] and [...] "organic" [...] sounds according to the sound director Yuu Miyake. Miyake employed the help of over 20 other Japanese artists and remixers to help the soundtrack, which was designed to act as part of a [...] "musical trilogy" [...] with the soundtrack to Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari. This was accomplished by choosing tracks from those games that were either fan or staff favorites and having them remixed by both Japanese and non-Japanese artists, though Miyake notes {{that the majority of the}} artists were Japanese as he did not <b>know</b> <b>many</b> non-Japanese musicians, the same problem that kept non-Japanese artists out of the first two soundtracks of the [...] "trilogy". Miyake has stated that focusing so much on using music from earlier in the series made it very challenging to still allow each artist to explore their creativity, and does not intend to repeat this strategy if a new game is ever made.|$|E

He was gone for three months, remaining with Alert as far as the island of Disco in Baffin Bay. He wrote of this journey: [...] "I never had a happier cruise... a nobler set of fellows never sailed together." [...] He returned to England on the support vessel , although the homeward voyage was delayed after Valorous struck a reef and required substantial repairs. Markham's extended absence from his India Office duties, together with his increasing involvement in a range of other interests, caused his superiors to request his resignation. Markham retired from his post in 1877, his 22 years of service entitling him to a pension.|$|E

United took a 15th-minute lead through Mikaël Silvestre, but Henry equalised for Arsenal soon after, from a free-kick. Jeffers was sent off {{in the second half}} for kicking out at Phil Neville and no further goals scored meant the outcome of the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Goalkeeper Tim Howard saved Van Bronckhorst and Pirès' spot kicks as United won the game 4–3 on penalties. Wenger made reference to Arsenal's low crowd turnout after the match and suggested it meant there was [...] "less and less appetite" [...] for the Shield.

First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting.

[...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil.
