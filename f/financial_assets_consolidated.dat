40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{challenges in}} effectively implementing the lender-of-last-resort {{function in the}} EU single financial market. Briefly highlighted are features of the EU financial landscape that could increase EU systemic financial risk. Briefly described are {{the complexities of the}} EU''s financialstability architecture for preventing and resolving financial problems, including lender-of-last-resort operations. The paper examines how the lender-of-last-resort function might materialize during a systemic financial disturbance affecting more than one EU member state. The paper identifies challenges and possible ways of enhancing the effectiveness of the existing architecture.

40|$|Traditionally, {{financial}} {{institutions in the}} country accept valuable asset (real estate and financial) as security for loans with greater preference for real estate. However, consequent upon rising cases of loan default and bad debt arising from non-performance of security assets and the attendant problems associated with sales of real estate, there is a gradual shift towards <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Against this background, this paper examines the relative performance of real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> as security for loans {{with a view to}} ascertain whether or not the drift towards <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> is justified. Using a sample of Forty six transactions involving landed and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and test of difference between two population means, the study reveals that although, the banks still prefer <b>financial</b> <b>asset,</b> however, both real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> provided cover for the secured loans but real estate has a superior performance on the long run.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{so-called}} “asset meltdown hypothesis”, which postulates a direct link between demographic developments {{and the level of}} asset prices. In particular, proponents of this hypothesis argue, when baby boomers start entering retirement they will become net sellers of <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to finance retirement consumption. As subsequent generations are smaller in numbers, other things equal, this would put downward pressure on <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices. Revisiting this hypothesis, there is some support for a link between demographics and <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices, although the link may not be strong. A number of mitigating factors exist, so that “other things” will not be equal. A major question in this context is to what extent demographic developments and their implications for other variables affecting <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices are already reflected in <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices and how fast any additional pressures on <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices will play themselves out. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{operation}} of the Level 1, 2, and 3 measurement uncertainty hierarchy embedded in the SFAS 157 accounting for <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Prior studies conclude the SFAS 157 fair value measurement model and prevailing financial market conditions are causal factors for the lower value relevance of the Level 3 <b>financial</b> <b>assets.</b> The contribution of our paper is to provide evidence on an additional, hitherto undocumented source of measurement uncertainty impacting the relevance of SFAS 157 <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to investors: the type of asset appearing in Level 3 <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> as a result of asset securitizations and SFAS 140 securitization accounting.

40|$|In {{recent years}} studies {{examining}} international mixed-asset portfolios {{have failed to}} uncover any significant benefits from foreign real estate. These papers have concentrated their focus on {{foreign exchange rate risk}} as "the problem" with respect to foreign investments, and therefore they sought solutions from traditional hedging tools such as leverage, options, forward contracts and even currency swaps. This study considers differences among countries in national income tax rates as a plausible explanation for the interest in foreign real estate investment. Hypothetically, it may be possible for investors to move a portion of their wealth to a foreign country and take advantage of lower marginal tax rates. After-tax returns from mixed-asset portfolios consisting of (1) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> only, (2) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> plus foreign <b>financial</b> <b>assets,</b> and (3) domestic <b>financial</b> <b>assets,</b> foreign <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and foreign real estate are evaluated.
