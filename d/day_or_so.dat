5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E

60|$|To travel {{along with}} a cranky ship for ninety <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> is no doubt a nerve-trying experience; {{but in this case}} what was wrong with our craft was this: that by my system of loading she had been made much too stable.|$|R
5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors and a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> with each player {{and member of}} the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|John the Fearless accused Isabeau and Orléans {{of fiscal}} {{mismanagement}} and again demanded money for himself, in recompense {{for the loss}} of royal revenues after his father's death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold's revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights, and entered Paris in 1405. Orléans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of Melun, with her household and children a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy's uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time Charles was lucid for about a month and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that {{came to be known as}} the enlèvement of the dauphin, almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. Orléans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city's gates were locked. In October Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute, in response to a letter from Christine de Pizan and an ordinance from the Royal Council.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{after the events}} of Escape from New York. Snake {{has been given a}} military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

50|$|The {{breeding}} season starts in October and lasts {{for almost half}} a year. A single egg is incubated for about 51 days, with the parents changing between incubation and feeding every four <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Time to fledging is not well known, but by analogy with Buller's shearwater's relatives assumed to be around 100 days.|$|R
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} went unharassed, and for {{the next}} <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> quiet settled over the Segamat area.

25|$|No equinox or {{solstice}} {{will ever}} {{be more than a}} <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away from its mean date according to the solar calendar, while nineteen Jewish years average 6939d 16h 33m 03s compared to the 6939d 14h 26m 15s of nineteen mean tropical years. This discrepancy has mounted up to six days, which is why the earliest Passover currently falls on 26 March (as in AM 5773 / 2013 CE).|$|E
25|$|After {{the tick}} is removed {{pruritus}} may recur {{at the site}} of attachment at intervals over some weeks, and a small firm lump usually forms within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the tick's removal.

In other cases the skin reactions may be severe with marked pruritus and considerable erythema, oedema and induration. People also report headaches.|$|E
25|$|Once {{in control}} of the city, the army encircled each {{district}} looking for young men. At first they shot whomever they saw. After a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> they arrested every male over the age of 15. Shia clerics found walking on the streets were rounded up and never seen again. Dead bodies were mined and they were not allowed to be removed from the streets. Helicopter gunships on the outskirts reportedly strafed civilians fleeing the city as well.|$|E
60|$|The trader Thomas, it appeared, had {{intended}} to start for Jerusalem that morning with his goods.

He flew back a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later in 9 hours though he interrupted the flight with a stop at Canterbury, Kent.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of river-going traffic next to Shad Thames. It is part of the {{particularly}} deep section of river called the Pool of London, which even ships can navigate. So from time to time even full-size cruise ships or naval vessels will stop next to Shad Thames, usually for a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> often then proceeding through Tower Bridge (though they can go no further than the next crossing, London Bridge). Police boats and speedboats pass by frequently, as do passenger boats (such as the Damien Hirst-decorated 'Tate to Tate' boat), and yachts from St Katharine Docks {{on the north side of}} the river opposite Shad Thames.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen {{turned to}} support Reichenau in the Battle of Belgium. Richthofen {{provided}} close and interdiction {{support to the}} German Sixth Army, in particular, to Erich Hoepner's XVI Army Corps. Just 12 Ju 87s were lost, anti-aircraft fire accounted for six I./StG 76 machines. His support operations were usually 65 kilometres (40mi) ahead of the forward edge of the battlefield, with even reconnaissance aircraft pressed into service as bombers. Army units carried flares and Swastika flags to prevent friendly fire incidents. In the Battle of Hannut Richthofen's forces proved effective against French armour during the battle. He also supported the German divisions a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later, at the Battle of Gembloux Gap.|$|E
