500|$|Joel Keller of AOLTV {{called it}} a [...] "vast improvement" [...] from the {{previous}} episode [...] "Nepotism", because he felt that [...] "everyone at Dunder-Mifflin [...] Scranton acted like themselves". Keller called Toby and Michael's counseling session [...] "great" [...] and enjoyed the way Toby was able to trick Michael. Kelly Gerlach of TV Equals enjoyed the episode and noted that it [...] "felt like the earlier seasons" [...] because [...] "there wasn’t forced humor, nothing made me cringe <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> because of bad writing, and the awkward situations were written specifically to be awkward." [...] In the end, she called the episode [...] "decent".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
500|$|The Futon Critic and TV.com staff {{highlighted}} [...] "The Day We Died" [...] {{as one of}} {{the best}} television episodes of the 2010–11 United States network television schedule. Likewise, Give Me My Remote contributor Marisa Rothman ranked [...] "The Day We Died" [...] one of the best episodes of the year, explaining [...] "Between Walter's eventual reunion with his loved ones and Olivia's tragic demise, few episodes were as heartbreaking as 'The Day We Died'...not to mention, no episode shocked me as much with a plot twist. (I literally bolted up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> when Peter vanished into thin air after creating a bridge between the universes.)" [...] Entertainment Weekly included the episode's ending in their list of television's best cliffhangers of 2011, and later named it the sixteenth best episode of the series. Time gave [...] "The Day We Died" [...] an honorable mention on their list of the best episodes of the season.|$|E
5000|$|Tori Amos's song [...] "Glory of the 80s", on her album To Venus and Back, {{mentions}} having [...] "The Story of O <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bucket <b>seat</b> of <b>my</b> wanna-be Mustang".|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] shouted Joshua, seizing {{me by the}} arm, but I drew my dagger on him and he let go. Then he fled {{with the}} other lords, and I {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> high <b>seat</b> beneath the golden canopy alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take you my knitting," [...] said Madame Defarge, {{placing it}} in her lieutenant's hands, [...] "and have it ready for me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> usual <b>seat.</b> Keep me <b>my</b> usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will {{probably}} be a greater concourse than usual, to-day." ...|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E
2500|$|On March 6, 1999, Jones was {{involved}} in an accident when he crashed his sport utility vehicle near his home. He {{was taken to the}} Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), where he was released two weeks later. In May of that year, Jones pleaded guilty to drunk driving charges related to the accident. [...] (In his memoir published three years earlier, Jones admitted that he sometimes [...] had a glass of wine before dinner and that he still drank beer occasionally but insisted, [...] "I don't squirm <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> fighting the urge for another drink" [...] and speculated, [...] "...perhaps I'm not a true alcoholic in the modern sense of the word. [...] Perhaps I was always just an old fashion drunk.") ...|$|E
60|$|I waited <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> for {{ten minutes}} or more, {{and then as a}} number of {{passengers}} left the car, I took up my bag and did the same.|$|E
60|$|I {{am going}} to put on {{sackcloth}} and ashes this day. I am indulged so far as to appear <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>seat.</b> Peccavi, pater, miserere mei. My book will be ready in a fortnight. If you have any subscribers, return them by Connell. The Lord stand with the righteous; amen, amen. R. B.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} night came and so great was the throng, so strong the {{pressure}} on the doors that the lock gave way and I, with my dollar clutched tightly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand, was borne into the hall and half-way up the stairs without touching foot to the floor, and when at last, safe <b>in</b> <b>my</b> balcony <b>seat</b> I waited for the curtain to rise, I had a distinct realization that a shining milestone was about to be established <b>in</b> <b>my</b> youthful trail.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} at her in surprise. I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own room, <b>seated</b> by the dressing-table, late at night, when we'd gone up to bed; and Minnie was beside me, {{standing}} up, with her bedroom candle in that pretty white little hand of hers.|$|R
60|$|I {{never felt}} so bally {{conspicuous}} in my life. I huddled down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> and wished I could turn my collar up. Everybody {{seemed to be looking}} at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you will}} sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> O Shadow, and as your lord, Abi will sit on Pharaoh's throne {{and find it}} hard. But what of Egypt and my people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The time {{to laugh}} had come at last. And I took my fill of it, I can tell you. I held my sides and rolled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> they had such startled faces. 'What's got into him, the animal?' cries Mafile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, uncle," [...] remarked Ned, {{settling}} his bulky frame more {{comfortably in}} the easy-chair, and twirling his watch-key, [...] "I {{find it more}} difficult every day {{to believe that the}} events of the last few months of my life have actually occurred. When I sit here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old <b>seat,</b> and look at you and the cat and the furniture--everything, in fact, just the same as when I left--I cannot realise that I have been nearly two years away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your sagacity and {{philosophy}} {{have been the}} wonder of the world, sir. There {{can be no doubt}} that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> profession a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> the House would be of the greatest possible advantage to me. It enables a man to do a great many things which he could not touch without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I put him back, {{conscious}} at {{his touch}} of a certain icy pang along my blood. [...] "Come, sir," [...] said I. [...] "You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please." [...] And I showed him an example, and sat down myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> customary <b>seat</b> and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my pre-occupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody in {{the house}} laughed. I came to my senses and fell back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> {{overcome}} with mortification. Mother was shaking with laughter. I could have shaken her. Why hadn't she pulled me down and choked me before I had made such an idiot of myself. She protests that there wasn't time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou art {{a glorious}} man, Eric Brighteyes. I thought {{the world had}} no more of such a breed. Listen to my bidding: come thou to the earldom in Orkneys and be a son to me, and I will give thee all good gifts, and, when I die, thou shalt sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> after me." ...|$|E
60|$|I turned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat.</b> The Maria's {{mainsail}} was up, and the jib {{was being}} hoisted, {{and her head}} was rapidly falling off to the wind. Farrar was casting. In the stern, waving a handkerchief, I recognized Mrs. Cooke, and beside her a figure in black, gesticulating frantically, a vision of coat-tails flapping in the breeze. Then the yacht heeled on her course and forged lakewards.|$|E
60|$|That intolerably keen {{instinct}} of his {{seemed to}} have anticipated my scheme: he {{met me at the}} threshold, hurried me into the room, and fixed me in a minute <b>in</b> <b>my</b> former <b>seat.</b> Taking the plate of fruit from my hand, he divided the portion intended only for himself, and ordered me to eat my share. I complied with no good grace, and vexed, I suppose, by my reluctance, he opened a masked and dangerous battery. All he had yet said, I could count as mere sound and fury, signifying nothing: not so of the present attack.|$|R
60|$|Even {{while this}} was in the course of utterance, the hands were {{snatched}} from me to be applied to their owner's face, and the dear girl burst into a flood of tears. I folded her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> arms, <b>seated</b> myself at her side on a sofa, and am not ashamed to say that we wept together. I shall not reveal all that passed during the next quarter of an hour, nor am I quite certain that I could were I to make the attempt, but I well recollect my arm was around Lucy's slender waist, {{at the end of that}} brief period. What was said was not very coherent, nor do I know that anybody would care to hear, or read it.|$|R
60|$|Then I too {{rose from}} <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> for I {{had made a}} vow not to allow a wasp to be killed {{unnecessarily}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> presence.|$|R
60|$|We {{came to the}} end of the stage, {{and still}} the lost trace was not recovered. I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change, but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood {{watching}} the ostlers that he had heard nothing. Almost in an instant afterwards, as I leaned back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> he looked in, with his lighted lantern in his hand, an excited and quite different man.|$|E
60|$|With {{plenty of}} time to think, I thought, {{crouched}} low <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> silent as an owl. True, I dozed off now and again but even when shortened by these periods of forgetfulness, the journey seemed interminable and when I reached the grimy old shed of a station which was the Chicago terminal of the Northwestern in those days, I was glad of a chance to taste outside air, no matter how smoky it reported itself to be.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a day}} {{of despair}} which I spent in this place, sitting all day indoors, for it was raining hard, {{immersed}} in my own gloomy thoughts, pretending to doze <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> {{and out of the}} narrow slits of my half-closed eyes seeing the others, also sitting or moving about, like shadows or people in a dream; and I cared nothing about them, and wished not to seem friendly, even {{for the sake of the}} food they might offer me by and by.|$|E
60|$|With {{frontier}} strength ye stand your ground, With grand content ye circle round, Tumultuous {{silence for}} all sound, Ye distant nursery of rills, Monadnock, and the Peterboro' hills; Like some vast fleet, Sailing through rain and sleet, Through winter's cold and summer's heat; Still holding on, upon your high emprise, Until ye find a shore amid the skies; Not skulking close to land, With cargo contraband. For they who sent a venture out by ye Have set {{the sun to}} see Their honesty. Ships of the line, each one, Ye to the westward run, Always before the gale, Under a press of sail, With weight of metal all untold. I seem to feel ye, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> firm <b>seat</b> here, Immeasurable depth of hold, And breadth of beam, and length of running gear.|$|R
60|$|MORE. I've held <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> {{with you}} <b>in</b> all weathers for nine years. You've all been bricks to me. <b>My</b> heart's <b>in</b> <b>my</b> work, Banning; I'm {{not eager to}} undergo {{political}} eclipse at forty.|$|R
60|$|And yet I kept <b>my</b> <b>seat.</b> Never had the {{resolution}} {{to discover what}} my husband was hiding from me been more firmly rooted <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind than {{it was at that}} moment! I cannot account for the extraordinary inconsistency <b>in</b> <b>my</b> character which this confession implies. I can only describe the facts as they really were.|$|R
6000|$|Sensibly, I fear, to my {{neighbour}} I {{winced at}} her words; I felt a prick {{that made me}} meditate. Then I said: [...] "Is that, by chance, the way he gave me?" [...] Mrs. Highmore remained silent so long that I had somehow {{the sense of a}} fresh pang; and after a minute, turning <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> I laid my hand on her arm, fixed my eyes upon her face and pursued pressingly: [...] "Do you suppose it to be to my 'Occasional Remarks' that Mr. Bousefield refers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but it wouldn't be fair, it wouldn't be decent: it's a {{case when}} I must be <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> from {{the rise of}} the curtain." [...] Peter, about this, was {{thoroughly}} lucid. [...] "I should force your mother to dine an hour earlier than usual and then in return for her courtesy should go off to my entertainment at eight o'clock, leaving her and Grace and Biddy languishing there. I wish I had proposed in time that they should go with me," [...] he continued not very ingenuously.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely {{knowing what}} I did, I turned round <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> and obeyed her. There is, perhaps, a certain preciseness about my {{appearance}} {{as well as}} my attire. I am tall enough--well over six feet--but my complexion still retains traces of my years in Africa and of my fondness for outdoor sports. My hair is straight and I have never grown beard or mustache. I felt, somehow, that I represented the things which in an Englishman are a little derided by young ladies {{on the other side of}} the water.|$|E
60|$|We said no {{more about}} it, nor did he {{say a word about}} the future of Bleak House. But {{it was the first time}} I had taken <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> at his side <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{mourning}} dress, and that accounted for it, I considered.|$|R
6000|$|A radiant stranger, who saw not me. I queried, [...] "Get {{out to her}} do I dare?" [...] But I kept <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{search for}} a plea, And the wheels moved on. O could it but be [...] That I had alighted there! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tossed out}} {{on to the}} floor the old Lyndsey finery which some homesick impulse had persuaded me to bring away <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trunk. <b>Seated</b> there with busy needle under the window, sewing in every gewgaw and scrap of tinsel and finery I could lay hands on, I {{prepared}} for the morrow. How happy I was. Bats in the dewy dusk-light cast faint, flitting shadows on the casements. A large dark moth hawked to and fro above my head. It seemed I could spend eternity in this gentle ardent busyness. To think that God had given me {{what might have been}} so dreadful a thing as solitude, but which <b>in</b> reality, while <b>my</b> thoughts and fingers were thus placidly occupied, could be so sweet. When at length I leaned out on the cold sill, my work done, wrists and shoulders aching with fatigue, Croomham clock struck two. The moon was set. But there, as if <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own happy mind, away to the East shone Orion. Why, Sirius, then, must be in hiding under that quiet shoulder of the downs. A dwindling meteor silvered across space; I breathed a wish, shivered, and drew in.|$|R
