500|$|During {{the reign}} of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE), Fan Shengzhi wrote a manual (i.e. the Fan Shengzhi shu 氾勝之書) which {{described}} the pit field system (aotian 凹田). In this system, every mou of farmland was divided into 3,840 grids which each had a small pit that was dug [...] deep and [...] wide and had good quality manure mixed into the soil. Twenty seeds were sowed into each pit, which allegedly produced 0.6 L (20 oz) of harvested grain per pit, or roughly 2,000 L (67,630 oz) per mou. This system did not require oxen-driven plows or the most fertile land, since it could be employed even on sloping terrains where supplying water was difficult for other methods of farming. Although this <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> was favored by the poor, it did require intensive labor, thus only large families could maintain such a system.|$|E

50|$|After {{the lobster}} seed is sold to farmers, they are {{normally}} placed into sea cages and grown to adult size for harvest at about 1 kg. This takes about 18- 24 months. Three methods of cage culture exist. The first <b>farming</b> <b>method,</b> is a floating cage, where a frame about 10 to 20 m2 in area {{is supported by}} buoys and holds the lobster cages, and is normally moored in waters 10-20m deep. Such cage method occurs most commonly on Nha Trang Bay. The second <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> is wooden fixed cages, made from 2.5m length by 10 cm width wood with salt resistance, placed about 2 m apart so to create a square shape and normally have an area of 20-40 m2 up to 100-200 m2 with varying cage size. They are usually on or off seabed in areas with little wave activity. Normally such cage methods are found in Van Phong Bay. The third cage <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> is the submerged cage method, made from iron mesh with meshing of 15-16 mm, with an overall size of the cage ranging from 1 - 16 m2 and with a height of 1 - 1.5 m. These submerged cages, are most common around the Nha Phu Lagoon.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sustainable Development Planning and Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The main aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to assess the}} {{sustainability}} of the original Green Revolution (GR) <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> for small-scale farmers in developing countries, to identify alternative <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> which may be more sustainable and {{to comment on the}} New GR for Africa, currently being promoted by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). A key element of the thesis was primary research done in India, in order to gather the experience of selected small-scale farmers in that country who had converted from GR to low-external input <b>farming</b> <b>methods.</b> The experience of the farmers in India was used to highlight points made in the thesis. Both primary and secondary data were used to inform the study. Firstly, a literature review was conducted in order to assess the original GR, identify alternative <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> and gather information on the New GR for Africa. In order to assess sustainability, a framework was developed which defined sustainability at a global level and also {{at the level of the}} individual small-scale farmer. This framework was based on a discussion of sustainable development and the sustainable livelihoods approach. Key elements of GR and alternative <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> were identified and assessed according to this framework. Secondly, primary data was gathered in India from a group of small-scale farmers who had taken part in a programme by a nongovernmental organisation called Dharamitra. The data was collected through semistructured interviews and participant observation techniques. This data was used in order to illustrate points made in the literature review. The study concluded that many elements of <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> from the original GR are unsustainable, both globally and at the level of the small-scale farmer. The main findings were that GR <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> caused damage to the environment and in particular made small-scale farmers reliant on external inputs. Alternative <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> which used organic and low external input approaches were found to enhance and preserve the environment, while at the same time being more affordable for small-scale farmers. The experience of the farmers interviewed in India confirmed these findings and provided a useful illustration of concepts presented from the literature review. Lastly, the New GR for Africa was found to present elements of the original GR which are unsustainable for small-scale farmers, especially in terms of the reliance that would be created on external inputs. The study concluded with recommendations around the need to promote <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> to small-scale farmers which promote better care of the environment and are better able to promote sustainable livelihoods, namely organic or low external input methods. Recommendations were also made regarding the need for further research into the influence of AGRA’s policies and documentation of sustainable farming practices in Africa...|$|R
