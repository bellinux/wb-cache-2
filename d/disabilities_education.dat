25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the Individuals with <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The Individuals with <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the association among of Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), depression and isolation in disabled people. Method: The subjects consisted of 761 disabled people in Korea. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson’s correlational statistics. Results: There were significant differences in age, cause of disability, type of disability, degree of <b>disability,</b> <b>education,</b> job, perceived health condition, and economic status between disabled people with high and low levels of ADL and IADL. Depression showed significant differences in type of disability, degree of <b>disability,</b> <b>education,</b> job, perceived health condition, and economic state; isolation showed significant differences in age, cause of disability, type of <b>disability,</b> <b>education,</b> job, residence, perceived health condition, and economic status. A significant association was identified between depression and isolation (r=. 69, p <. 001). Conclusion: There was a high incidence of depression in disabled men with high levels of isolation and ADL and IADL dependence. An effort to increase disabled people’s ADL, IADL, and independence levels is needed, and nursing interventions should be designed and tested to increase their community involvement and decrease the sense of isolation and depression...|$|R

The paper concludes that providing there is a commitment from senior management, universities are well positioned to apply both vertical and horizontal approaches to teaching disability studies to medical students.
