2500|$|True dual-beam CRT {{oscilloscopes}} did exist, {{but were}} not common. One type (Cossor, U.K.) had a beam-splitter plate in its CRT, and single-ended deflection following the splitter. [...] Others had two complete electron guns, requiring tight control of axial (rotational) mechanical alignment in manufacturing the CRT. Beam-splitter types had <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> common to both vertical channels, but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time bases, or use one time base for both channels. Multiple-gun CRTs (up to ten guns) were made in past decades. With ten guns, the envelope (bulb) was cylindrical throughout its length.

2500|$|For an {{intuitive}} {{explanation of the}} origin of the Coriolis force, consider an object moving northward in the northern hemisphere. [...] Viewed from outer space, the object does not appear to go due north, but has an eastward motion (it rotates around toward the right along with the surface of the Earth). [...] The further north you go, the smaller the [...] "horizontal diameter" [...] of the Earth, and so the slower the eastward motion of its surface. [...] As the object moves north, to higher latitudes, it has a tendency to maintain the eastward speed it started with (rather than slowing down to match the reduced eastward speed of local objects on the Earth's surface), so it veers east (i.e. to the right of its initial motion). Though not obvious from this example, which considers northward motion, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> occurs equally for objects moving east or west (or any other direction).|$|E

2500|$|In popular (non-technical) {{usage of}} the term [...] "Coriolis effect", the {{rotating}} reference frame implied is almost always the Earth. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need {{to account for the}} Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects. [...] The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects {{on the surface of the}} Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> effect is greater near the poles, since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the equator. Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology).|$|E

40|$|A {{graphical}} {{method of}} analysis for the preliminary design of tall building structures comprising braced frames with outrigger trusses subjected to horizontal loading is presented. For this {{method of analysis}} {{it is necessary to}} determine five stifnesses for the uniform structure: bending and racking shear stiffnesses of the braced frame and outriggers in addition to a stiffness parameter representing the axial lengthening and shortening of the exterior columns. The analysis allows a simple procedure for obtaining the optimum location of the outrigger up the height of the structure and a rapid assessment {{of the impact of the}} outrigger on the behaviour of the high-rise structure. It is concluded that all five stiffnesses should be included in the preliminary analysis of a proposed tall building structure as the reductions in <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflections</b> and bending moments of the braced frame are influenced by all stiffness parameter...|$|R

The key issues addressed in this thesis, are the motion past obstacles in the extrusions, a lightweight mechanism that is stiff with minimal <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflections,</b> can adjust to different heights and can support its own weight. The design favored consisted of a chain drive designed to travel 3 meters in 10 seconds at a weight of 30 Kilograms. The machine is kept in place by five points of contact, including a fixed sprocket and four sliding V-grooved rollers.

40|$|The {{deflection}} of corrugated dual-walled polyethylene pipe {{was investigated}} in the laboratory. Laboratory deflections were compared to those predicted by the Burns-Richard model under vertical loads of up to 112 meters of fill height (1, 900 kPa). Test temperatures ranged from ambient to 60 ºC. Load and temperature ranges were selected to simulate conditions on copper and gold leach pads, though these conditions can also be applicable to large landfills. The results of the comparisons indicate good correlation between laboratory measurements and the Burns-Richard solutions for vertical deflections to the maximum depths considered, but that soil modulus values from the literature need to be adjusted for the higher load conditions. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>deflections</b> did not correlate, suggesting that either the Burns-Richard model is incorrect for this condition or that soil modulus under these loading conditions is anisotropic.

40|$|An {{approximate}} hand {{method for}} estimating <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflections</b> in high-rise steel frames with flexible beam–column connections subjected to horizontal loading is presented. The method is {{developed from the}} continuous medium theory for coupled walls which is expressed in non-dimensional structural parameters. It accounts for bending deformations in all individual members as well as axial deformations in the vertical members and is more accurate for very tall structures. Additional deformations in the beam–column connections contributing to the overall frame deformations are {{also included in the}} analysis. This reduction in the frame stiffness requires the non-dimensional structural parameters to be modified. A closed solution of the differential equation for the cantilevered structure yields a rapid assessment of the influence of different types of connection on the overall behaviour. Results for structures that are uniform with height compare closely with results from stiffness matrix analyses. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley 2 ̆ 6 amp; Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an effective approach {{to estimate the}} nonlinear deflection of thin cantilever beams, which are {{the building blocks of}} micro and nano electromechanical systems, fabricated with micro and nanosized characteristic lengths.

The later is adopted here to obtain theoretical deflections, which are compared with experimental results in order to identify empirical deflection models based on quintic polynomials. Theoretical and experimental results are presented to validate the deflection models and to demonstrate the efficacy of the models in order to estimate the nonlinear deflection of the cantilever beams.

40|$|Details of {{a series}} of lateral {{buckling}} tests on a pultruded GRP I-section cantilever beam are described. The cantilever, which had spans ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 m, was subjected to point loads applied above, at and below the centroid of the free end cross-section. Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflections</b> and the rotation of the free end cross-section were recorded as the beam was loaded and unloaded. Lateral buckling loads computed from modified simple closed form formulae and finite element eigenvalue analysis were compared with the maximum test loads. The computed buckling loads were generally significantly lower than the maximum test loads, though the differences between the loads appeared to be smallest for the longest span with the load applied just above the lower flange of the free end cross-section. The tests showed that significant vertical free end deflections develop before the cantilever buckles laterally and it is concluded that the effects of prebuckling deformations and geometric nonlinearity in addition to a more accurate evaluation of the in-plane shear modulus may have {{to be taken into account}} in order to achieve a closer correlation between the numerical analysis and the test results...|$|R

For this reason signal processing methods, namely the autocorrelation and the Lomb normalized periodogram, were alternately applied. The autocorrelation function was used {{to determine whether or not}} there existed a periodic signal of the displacements of the crest of the dam and in the changes of the reservoir level.

40|$|Slurry walls {{have been}} widely used for {{retrofitting}} earthen dams and levees. Slurry wall properties, such as strengths and permeability are well known, but there is very little research on their seismic performance. This research includes shake table testing of two common types of slurry walls: sand-cement-bentonite (SCB), and cement-bentonite (CB) walls. Reduced-scale slurry walls with dimensions of 150 cm (long) x 160 cm (tall) x 20 cm (thick) were constructed inside a rigid, steel box that was mounted on top of a shake table. Boundary conditions in the shake table tests were addressed; and dynamic scaling laws were followed to scale the seismic motions. Specimens were tested under two seismic excitations: modified Loma Prieta earthquake motions and sinusoidal sweep frequency motions from 0. 20 Hz to 6 Hz. Accelerations, <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflections,</b> dynamic vertical deformations, and dynamic soil pressures were recorded using accelerometers, linear potentiometers, linear variable differential transducers, and stress cells, respectively.
