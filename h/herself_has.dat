It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing and analysis of the bust have proved it to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|Though Lieder <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> not {{specified}} a new {{date for the}} object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, {{as it was the}} end of a cycle (baktun) in the long count in the Mayan calendar. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Wendy Rose’s work {{is deeply}} rooted in {{ethnography}} and the living myths of Indian peoples. Noted for verse detailing her search for tribal and personal identity, much of Rose’s poetry examines the experiences of mixed-blood Native Americans estranged from both native and white societies. This stems from her own mixed heritage and search for identity. Rose <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> said, “Everything I write is fundamentally autobiographical, no mater what style or topic.” Yet unlike many current and conventional white poets, her poems go beyond self-analysis to focus on others caught between cultures like herself.|$|E

Lara Croft <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> {{become one of the most}} recognisable video game protagonists in existence, winning numerous accolades and earning places on the Walk of Game and Guinness World Records. Alongside being praised for pioneering female characters in video games, she has also been the subject of controversy due to her sex appeal being used for marketing.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is {{the simple fact of}} being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not to be a political platform. She has also stated that she views comedy {{as one of the most}} valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, January 25, 1949, Scott {{collapsed}} {{and went into}} hysterics on the RKO set of The Big Steal (1949). She immediately quit {{after three days of}} production. According to Scott's replacement, Jane Greer, Scott quit because she was concerned about being associated with the leading man, Robert Mitchum, who at the time was jailed at the local honor farm for a marijuana conviction—Mitchum was convicted January 10, 1949. It was also later alleged that Hal Wallis was supposedly responsible for Scott's bowing out. Yet, Scott starred with Mitchum in a RKO film two years later. During this same period, the press reported rumors of Scott's stage fright, an ailment common to actors. Scott <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> admitted to stage fright, explaining her absence during premieres of her films.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in a radio}} address, the Emperor of Japan announces {{the end of the}} War. Suzu, having faced countless {{setbacks}} and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shūsaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in Suzu & Shūsaku's family home, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ambush}} of the 507th Maintenance Company during the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March, {{the bodies of}} several U.S. {{soldiers}} {{who had been killed}} in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. Donald Walters, no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the Third Geneva Convention. Sergeant Walters was initially reported to {{have been killed in the}} ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition. However, an eyewitness later reported that he had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured, and he was posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War Medal in 2004. It was alleged in the authorized biography of Pfc. Jessica Lynch that she was raped by her captors after her capture, based on medical reports and the pattern of her injuries, though this is not supported by Ms Lynch. Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, who later helped American forces rescue Lynch, stated that he saw an Iraqi Colonel slap Lynch while she was in her hospital bed. The staff at the hospital where Lynch was held later denied both stories, saying that Lynch was well cared for. While Lynch suffers from amnesia due to her injuries, Lynch <b>herself</b> <b>has</b> denied any mistreatment whilst in captivity.|$|E

The comment caused Berlusconi's wife, Veronica Lario, to demand an apology through a national newspaper, something which she also received.
