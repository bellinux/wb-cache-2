5|$|The Roman army battled first {{against its}} tribal {{neighbours}} and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came {{to dominate the}} Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern, {{and the majority of}} Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>town</b> to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. The second is the civil war, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.|$|E

25|$|Under an {{agreement}} between the two, Tuttle supplied Flagler with the land for a hotel and a railroad station for free, and they split the remainder of her 640 acres (2.6km²) north of the Miami River in alternating sections.

25|$|In the 1960s, Broken Arrow {{began to}} grow <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>town</b> into a {{suburban}} city. The Broken Arrow Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 51) was constructed in the mid-1960s and connected the city with downtown Tulsa, fueling growth in Broken Arrow. The population swelled from a little above 11,000 in 1970 to more than 50,000 in 1990, and then more than 74,000 by the year 2000. During this time, the city {{was more of a}} bedroom community.

25|$|Since its construction, {{the bridge}} has made {{significant}} impacts {{on both sides of}} the bay; among them has been the growth of Eastern Shore communities. When the bridge opened in 1952, and again when the second span was added in 1973, the Eastern Shore was given easier access to Baltimore and Washington, causing areas in southern Queen Anne's County to develop as bedroom communities. This extension of the Baltimore–Washington suburbs has led Queen Anne's County to be listed as part of the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area. The bridge has also given easier access to Ocean City from the Western Shore, which has caused Ocean City to grow <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>town</b> to one that is said to become the second largest city in Maryland during the summer.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, several {{forms of}} {{industrial}} development shaped Minnesota. [...] In 1882, a hydroelectric power plant was built at Saint Anthony Falls, marking one of the first developments of hydroelectric power in the United States. [...] Iron mining began in northern Minnesota {{with the opening of the}} Soudan Mine in 1884. [...] The Vermilion Range was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by Charlemagne Tower. [...] Another mining town, Ely began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888. [...] Soon after, the Mesabi Range was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in Mountain Iron. [...] The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface. [...] As a result, open-pit mines became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904. [...] To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway were built from the iron ranges to Two Harbors and Duluth on Lake Superior. [...] Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the Great Lakes. [...] The mining industry helped to propel Duluth <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>town</b> to a large, thriving city. [...] In 1904, iron was discovered in the Cuyuna Range in Crow Wing County. [...] Between 1904 and 1984, when mining ceased, more than 106milliontons of ore were mined. [...] Iron from the Cuyuna Range also contained significant proportions of manganese, increasing its value.|$|E
