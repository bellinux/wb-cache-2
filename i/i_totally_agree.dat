In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, [...] "If they were man and wife, {{it would make a}} lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|R
2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|R

However, with the Horseman’s Group having set prize-money tariffs specifying the minimum amount of prize-money racecourses should offer {{for each type of}} race, Gosden was {{one of a number of}} trainers to agree to a boycott of ‘under-tariff’ races, a stance that led Buick to comment [...] "It’s going to affect me, but <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> with it. Something has to be done about it and that’s the only way it’s going to be done, by people not running their horses." [...] Nevertheless, Buick was able to ride a century of winners in Britain in a calendar year for the first time and, for the second year running, was successful in five Group 1 contests worldwide.The first of these was a success on Nathaniel in the Group 1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July. Nathaniel had already given Buick the second Royal Ascot victory of his career in the King Group 2 Edward VII Stakes (quickly followed by Beachfire later that day in the Wolferton handicap) earlier in the season. Dream Ahead, on whom Buick had won two Group 1 races in 2011, won both the Sprint Cup at Haydock over 6f and then the Prix de la Foret over 7f at Longchamp, in which he beat the star French mare Goldikova, providing Buick with the first Group 1 double of his career, having won the Prix Marcel Boussac earlier that day on Elusive Kate for John Gosden.Buick’s also won a second successive St Leger with victory on Masked Marvel on what was just his second ride in the race.|$|E

Its builder has often been accused of being responsible for the near extinction of the Hotstox formula. Andy Smith takes up the story [...] "I had run Ray Witts close in the ‘91 points and decided to build a new car for ’92. I had {{spent a lot of time}} around the F1 scene and gathered a lot of ideas for the car. One of them was offset. No one had actually used a lot of offset and I soon realised that to get the engine over to the inside of the chassis, I needed to get it lower too. A lot of the other cars had massive cabs, mine featured a much smaller cab and my car was the first to feature spring boxes for weight jacking. It was a rush to get it ready for Hednesford and I’d had no help from my dad until right at the last minute when I was struggling to get the car finished in time. We managed to get it down to Hednesford the day before for some practice but that didn’t go too well as we had a misfire. We managed to cure that and make it to Hednesford the next day. I really didn’t know how well the car would go but it went like a rocket !. I won heat, Final and GN from the lap handicap, it just flew. The car was then weighed and found to be underweight and I was banned for 3 or 4 meetings and had my points and prize money taken away. It was a genuine mistake, I’d rushed to get the car done and didn’t even consider the weight. What made it worse was that they had weighed some cars the previous week and found some cars under and overweight but had let them go as long as the drivers put it right for the next meeting. <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> that I should have had my points and money taken off me but I can’t help but think that they had been harsh with me." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{would appear}} to be a perfect example of the HESS-D {{approach}} to open com-mentary and discussion on submitted papers being very valuable. The discussion in my paper and the comments by Erwin Zehe encapsulate an on-going discussion that will, in fact, run for the foreseeable future because it has to do as much with a matter of beliefs as with the science.

40|$|Surveillance is {{necessary}} but not sufficient for prevention <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> with Barry Pless 1 that injury surveillance {{alone is not}} the answer to solving injury problems. In the area in which I do much of my own research, sports injury, this point has also previously been made by myself 2 and other leading commentators. 3 4 Unfortunately, as also pointed out by Pless, 1 there continues to be significant misunder-standing of exactly what surveillance should be, and the sports injury literature still contains many papers supposedly reporting injury surveillance studies based on retro-spective recall of injuries by athletes, detailed monitoring of injuries over a targeted, limited-term period (such as over a football season) or other ad hoc data collection activities. It {{is hard to see how}} the field will develop further without due attention to appropriate surveil-lance methodology and a wider embracing of the data collection methodologies continually being improved in the broader injury field. Pless 1 also questions whether any surveillance system can, in fact, contribute to prevention. Where I differ from him is that I do believe that such data are a necessary prerequisite for this, because, without them, theproblemcannot be identifiedandthere is no possibility of quantifying the burden of the adverse injury consequences.

If you do not, give {{examples}} of success stories in recent Indian medical education and practice benefiting poor patients. Ans: I agree with the author totally. I was fortunate to have studied under many teachers under whom he too had studied in the medical college. As Dr. Pandya described in his article, many of our teachers were compassionate, sincere, highly professional and considerate individuals. <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> with Dr. Pandya's views. The unprofessional and unethical acts of the present day teachers and medical practitioners sadden us. I hear of the examples indicating the prevalence of greed, corruption, plagiarism and favoritism every time I visit India. It is sad that the noble profession of medicine is maligned by unscrupulous and uncouth individuals. Q 2 : The author does not consider the steps to be taken by the authorities. Can the Government, municipal corporations, associations of doctors, medical councils improve matters? If so, what steps do you suggest?Ans: The first choice must be, 'Physician, heal thyself. ' Dr. Pandya has aptly emphasized that the 'unprofessional acts of teachers are likely to be followed by students. ' (I would say they are being followed by many of their students). The healing process should begin with: 1. Mandatory courses in medical ethics for medical students and house staff in medical colleges 2. Nationwide mandatory conferences in medical ethics for the education of practicing physicians from all branches of Medicine, including teachers in medical colleges. One physician from Mumbai approached me during one of my visits and offered to pay the US Government officials to get a visa and a Residency position in a US hospital. He could not pass the Visa Qualifying Examination. I told him to get out. 3. The basis of education in schools and colleges should be to create good citizens out of students. On the contrary, the teachers are encouraging delinquency. Unless the schools and colleges introduce a curriculum to prevent bribery, plagiarism, unprofessional behavior and selfishness, the domino effect on various professions and businesses will not end. 4 Unfortunately, regulating bodies such as Government, municipal corporations and medical councils are the propagating institutions for such practices. They will gladly develop laws and regulatory policies for punitive actions against physicians, with the resultant consequence of handing power to the administrators who in turn resort to corrupt practices. The corrupt administrators can then extract bribes from such physicians. [No abstract available. ...|$|E

Such a population does not really exist, and hence it is considered a hypothetical or imaginary population. Compare that definition with the population concept that would be in our minds when performing such measurements. We would probably assume that our study population consisted of pigs (not the growth rates of pigs!) and probably all the pigs at the farm we were sampling, rather than the all the growth rates of the pigs that might conceivably have been administered the same food. We overlook {{the fact that we are}} using the statistical tools to try to estimate ecological population para¬meters (and test specific hypotheses on the values of these population parameters) but that the ecological population which is in our minds and the statistical (imaginary) population of our tests need not necessarily be the same (and most often are not). So, to avoid wrong inferences (with wide–ranging consequences if we are dealing with decision–making processes) we should do all we possibly can to ensure that our natural populations are as similar as possible to the imaginary populations of statisticians, or at least we should discuss our results within the framework in which our inference was developed. Statistics is not an ad hoc tool invented for us, but rather a tool that we have borrowed from statisticians for our purposes. We should always keep this in mind. References Berryman, A. A., 2002.

As a population ecologist and conservation biologist <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> with these authors and, like them, I be¬lieve that greater precision and care is needed in the use and definition of ecological terms. The point I wish to stress here is that we ecologists tend to forget that when we use statistical tools to infer results from our sample to a population we work with what statisticians term "imaginary", "hypothetical" or "potential" popula¬tions. As Zar (1999) states, if our sample data consist of 40 measurements of growth rate in guinea pigs "the population about which conclusions might be drawn is the growth rates of all the guinea pigs that conceivably might have been administered the same food supplement under identical conditions". Such a population does not really exist, and hence it is considered a hypothetical or imaginary population. Compare that definition with the population concept that would be in our minds when performing such measurements. We would probably assume that our study population consisted of pigs (not the growth rates of pigs!) and probably all the pigs at the farm we were sampling, rather than the all the growth rates of the pigs that might conceivably have been administered the same food. We overlook the fact that we are using the statistical tools to try to estimate ecological population para¬meters (and test specific hypotheses on the values of these population parameters) but that the ecological population which is in our minds and the statistical (imaginary) population of our tests need not necessarily be the same (and most often are not). So, to avoid wrong inferences (with wide–ranging consequences if we are dealing with decision–making processes) we should do all we possibly can to ensure that our natural populations are as similar as possible to the imaginary populations of statisticians, or at least we should discuss our results within the framework in which our inference was developed. Statistics is not an ad hoc tool invented for us, but rather a tool that we have borrowed from statisticians for our purposes. We should always keep this in mind. References Berryman, A. A., 2002.

Prentice hall, New Jersey. A few years ago, Camus & Lima (2002) wrote an essay to stimulate ecologists to think about how we define and use a fundamental concept in ecology: the population. They concluded, concurring with Berryman (2002), that a population is "a group of individuals of the same species that live together in an area of sufficient size to permit normal dispersal and/or migration behaviour and in which population changes are largely the results of birth and death processes".
