The effectiveness of the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> is evaluated by comparing it with the optimal solution obtained by the optimal model for 42 small-scale problems. The result indicates that the solution obtained using the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> is very close to the optimal solution, and that the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> provides significant savings in computation time. Moreover, the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> is also compared with four existing heuristic rules based on an experiment involving the single-project and multi-project scheduling problems. The results indicate that the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> is superior to the four existing rules under the performance criteria of the average total project net present value and the average total project delay. In addition, the number of times that the proposed <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> can obtain the best solution is also far more than that of any other rule considered in this paper under the two aforementioned performance criteria. Furthermore, this study has found that the performance of a heuristic scheduling rule is significantly affected by the number of projects. A rule that can lower the total project delay to the minimum is also able to maxi 5 mize the total project net present value.

40|$|While {{many papers}} propose {{innovative}} methods for constructing individual rules in separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms, comparatively few study the <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> evaluation functions {{used in these}} algorithms {{to ensure that the}} selected rules combine into a good rule set. Underestimating the impact of this component has led to suboptimal design choices in many algorithms. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the importance of <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> evaluation functions by improving existing rule induction techniques and to provide guidelines for algorithm designers. We first select optimal <b>heuristic</b> <b>rule</b> learning functions for several metaheuristic-based algorithms and empirically compare the resulting heuristics across algorithms. This results in large and significant improvements of the predictive accuracy for two techniques. We find that despite the absence of a global optimal choice for all algorithms, good default choices can be shared across algorithms with similar search biases. A near-optimal selection can thus be found for new algorithms with minor experimental tuning. Lastly, a major contribution is made towards balancing a model’s predictive accuracy with its comprehensibility. We construct a Pareto front of optimal solutions for this trade-off and show that gains in comprehensibility and/or accuracy are possible for the techniques studied. The parametrized heuristics enable users to select the desired balance as they offer a high flexibility when it comes to selecting the desired accuracy and comprehensibility in rule miners. status: publishe...|$|E
