5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on the Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are {{those on the}} International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E

5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E

Josh suffers a breakdown while holding the camera, taunting Heather for their circumstances and her constant recording of the events.|$|E

Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E

5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army. Eighteen {{graduates of the}} Military Academy were eventually selected for astronaut training by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The first alumnus to graduate {{and go on to}} become an astronaut was Frank Borman, class of 1950. As of March 2009, the most recent alumnus to become an astronaut was Robert S. Kimbrough, class of 1989. Five alumni were part of Project Gemini, six part of the Apollo program, two <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on the Moon, and twelve were part of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|This list {{is drawn}} from {{graduates}} of the Naval Academy who became astronauts. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to fly as an astronaut was Alan Shepard, class of 1945. As of June 2017, the most recent alumni to complete astronaut training was Nicole Mann, class of 1999. Kayla Barron, class of 2010 was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 2017, but has not yet completed her training. Two alumni were part of Project Mercury, three part of Project Gemini, seven part of the Apollo program, three <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on the moon, one {{was part of the}} Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and forty-two were part of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E

5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that young hadrosaurs would <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on only their two hind legs, while adults would <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on all four. As the animal aged, the front limbs became more robust {{in order to}} take on weight, while the back legs became less robust as they transitioned to walking on all four legs. Furthermore, the animals’ front limbs were shorter than their back limbs.|$|E
