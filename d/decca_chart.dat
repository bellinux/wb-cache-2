2500|$|The {{biggest hit}} song of Crosby's career was his {{recording}} of Irving Berlin's White Christmas, which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. (A {{copy of the}} recording from the radio program {{is owned by the}} estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his 1942 movie Holiday Inn. His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by <b>Decca,</b> <b>charting</b> another 16 times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and for a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time. According to Guinness World Records, his recording of [...] "White Christmas" [...] has sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50million sales as singles. His recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. Though the two versions are similar, the 1947 recording is most familiar today. After his death in 1977, the song was re-released and reached the No. 5 position in the UK Singles Chart in December 1977. Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying [...] "a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully." ...|$|R

50|$|When My Baby Smiles at Me is {{the name}} of a popular song with music by Bill Munro and words by Andrew B. Sterling and Ted Lewis, that was {{published}} by Harry Von Tilzer Music Publishing in 1920. It was interpolated into the Broadway show The Greenwich Village Follies (1919) and was the first big hit for clarinettist, vocalist and comedian Ted Lewis (1892-1971). Ted Lewis's jazz band recording in 1920 for Columbia Records, became his signature tune, and spent 18 weeks on the charts (seven weeks at No. 1).

Piccadilly's release of Brown's [...] "Crazy Mixed Up Kid" [...] in April 1961 was the label's first single. Brown's recording band was {{a collection of}} session musicians, and was named the Bruvvers by Jack Good to give Brown the identity of having his own backing band for record releases.

In 1957, after winning the $1,000 top prize on television's Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts talent show, Braun was immediately hired by WLWT and WLW-AM. After cutting a handful of unsuccessful pop vocal recordings for labels such as Fraternity and Torch, Braun signed to <b>Decca</b> Records and <b>charted</b> his only Top 40 hit, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part," [...] in 1962. Braun later recorded for United Artists, but most of his subsequent recording efforts were released on small independent or vanity labels. In the mid-1970s he briefly hosted a local game show called On The Money. Braun was one of Cincinnati's biggest TV stars until 1984, when he moved to California for ten years to do commercials, talk shows and small movie roles. During that time, he was most often seen as the spokesperson for Craftmatic Adjustable Beds and announcer for controversial no-money-down real estate promoter Tony Hoffman, who later produced and marketed a recorded interview with O. J. Simpson. Braun also had a part in the Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 2.|$|R
