Salvador Dalí, who was in New York to attend the MoMA opening, was present at its first screening. During the screening, Dalí became outraged at Cornell's movie, claiming he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> the same idea of applying collage techniques to film. After the screening, Dalí remarked to Cornell that he should stick to making boxes and stop making films. Traumatized by this event, the shy, retiring Cornell showed his films rarely thereafter.|$|E

The Hortons <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> their medieval manor house demolished {{to make way}} for a large baroque building more in keeping with the times. Pillaton Hall was a 16th-century structure, originally conceived as simply a manor house for the small Littleton estate of Pillaton and Otherton. Littleton soon began work on a new and more impressive seat for the family. It was said that two large hoards of coins were discovered in 1742 and 1749 behind panels at Pillaton Hall, which raised the sum of £15,000 on sale, and thus defrayed the costs of the new hall.|$|E

500|$|In July 1915 Blamey {{was given}} a staff {{appointment}} as a general staff officer, Grade 2 (GSO2), [...] and in September {{he was promoted to}} temporary lieutenant colonel and joined the staff of the newly formed 2nd Division in Egypt as its assistant adjutant and quartermaster general (AA) – the senior administrative officer of the division. Its commander, Major General James Gordon Legge, preferred to have an Australian colonel in this post as he felt that a British officer might not take such good care of the troops. The 2nd Division Headquarters embarked for Gallipoli on 29 August 1915, but Blamey was forced to remain in Egypt as he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> an operation for haemorrhoids. He finally returned to Anzac on 25 October 1915, remaining {{for the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E
500|$|When Coghlan {{arrived to}} join his brother in 1882, Kimberley was a town of 22,000 in search of riches, {{according}} to John Smith Moffat. That same year, Cecil Rhodes incorporated the De Beers Mining Company and in 1883 {{was elected to the}} Cape Parliament as Member for the newly enfranchised Diamond Fields. Kimberley had come into being after diamonds were found on the De Beers brothers' farm on Colesberg Kopje in 1869.

500|$|Rootes {{entered the}} Tiger in European rallies, taking first, {{second and third}} places in the 1964 Geneva Rally. Two Tigers {{took part in the}} 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, one {{finishing}} fourth overall, the highest placing by a front-engined rear-wheel drive car, and the other eleventh. After finally having sorted out the engine overheating problem by fitting a forward-facing air scoop to the bonnet, Rootes entered three Tigers in the 1965 Alpine Rally, one of which crossed the finishing line as outright winner. Scrutineers later disqualified the car however, because it had been fitted with undersized cylinder head valves. By the end of the 1966 Acropolis Rally though, it had become clear that low-slung sports cars such as the Tiger were unsuited to the increasingly rough-terrain rally stages, and the car was withdrawn from competition soon after. In the words of Ian Hall, who drove the Tiger in the Acropolis Rally, [...] "I felt that the Tiger <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> it– it was an out of date leviathan".|$|E
500|$|Judge Prescott Keyes, {{who led the}} Concord committee, sent Beach the {{proposed}} design for the obverse (the Concord side) on February2, 1925, letting him know the Lexington design for the reverse, or Lexington side, would soon follow. The following day, Edward Stone, attorney for the Lexington committee, sent Beach a letter formalizing the contract. [...] Beach would not be paid unless the Commission of Fine Arts approved the plaster models. Beach replied to Stone on the 4th, relating that he had spoken to James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel and sculptor member of the commission, and had been informed that the commission <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> its monthly meeting, but that a quorum could be assembled to approve the coin. Beach noted that the Mint would take {{three or four weeks}} to begin striking coins once final approval was given; he had discussed this with Chief Engraver George T. Morgan in 1924. Morgan had recently died, but Beach did not expect the new chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to cause any additional delays.|$|E

He made notes concerning the family finances, upsetting Pat Nixon, who asked why people had to know their financial details. The senator responded that people in politics live in a fishbowl. He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie [...] "longed" [...] for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog [...] "Checkers".

500|$|Cotto relinquished {{his title}} in late 2006 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} move to the welterweight division to challenge Carlos Quintana for the WBA's championship. The fight took place on December 2, 2006. Cotto defeated Quintana by technical knockout in the fifth round. Following a punch to the body, Quintana surrendered {{prior to the start of}} the sixth round and Cotto won the vacant World Boxing Association Welterweight Championship. Cotto's Welterweight reign began successfully on March 3, 2007 when he retained his belt with a technical knock out victory in the eleventh round over Oktay Urkal. Urkal's corner threw in the towel because he was apparently down in the fight, and <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a second point deducted for a head butt, leading to his corner's belief that the referee was unfair. On June 9, 2007, Cotto defended the WBA Welterweight Title against Zab Judah in New York City, performing before a sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden. The bout included a knockdown and a point deduction registered for Cotto, who established dominance on the offensive following a close start. [...] At the moment of the stoppage, the judges had Cotto leading 97-91. Cotto won by technical knockout in the eleventh round when the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
500|$|Therefrom emerged a film {{treatment}} called The Message. The original script {{had more}} of a police procedural approach, with the alien being created by a [...] "bathtub geneticist" [...] who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> his project aborted by the government, and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer {{to search for the}} creature. Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name [...] "Sil," [...] Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym, but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code, which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human junk DNA to access [...] "all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [...] evolved through – including ones that had never developed, plus ones [...] don't know about that have become extinct." [...] Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life (CSEOL), talking to SETI scientists, and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project. The Message was offered to several studios, but was passed up.|$|E
