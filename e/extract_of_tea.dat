The extract from first-rate tea makes a very drinkable infusion, but that from second-rate tea is not good, the drink made from the extract always a grade inferior to that made directly from the leaves. By pouring a small quantity of the extract into warm water, the tea is made; and, though inferior in taste to properly made tea, it has an equally good effect on the digestion.|$|E

The enriched tea polyphenols including catechins {{have been reported to}} perform anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity. In this study, we compared the levels of catechins and caffeine in tea flowers from six different species of Camellia japonica, Camellia tenuifolia. Camellia oleifera, 2 savoury Camellias and Camellia sinensis. C sinensis detected a variety of catechins, while only (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin can be detected by the iso-cratic HPLC system in other tea flowers. The total catechin content was also lower in these tea flowers. In addition, the water <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> flowers was used to test the biological functions including anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. The water extract of C sinensis remained most active among six different species using both MTT assays and the cleavage analysis of apoptosis-related molecules, PARP and Bid. The major bioactivity of C. sinensis comes from (-) -epigallo-catechin- 3 -gallate and (-) -epigallocatechin, not detected in other five species. Interestingly, we found that C. tenuifolia still had potent bioactivity. It is likely that bioactive molecules other than catechins exist in C tenuifolia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and olive leaves extracts and their combination in male mice intoxicated with a sublethal concentration of diazinon. Exposure of mice to 6. 5 [*]mg/kg body weight of diazinon for seven weeks resulted in statistical increases of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, creatinine, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol, while the value of serum total protein was declined. Treating diazinon-intoxicated mice with tea and olive leaves extracts or their combination significantly attenuated the severe alterations in these hematobiochemical parameters. Moreover, {{the results indicated that}} the supplementation with combination <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and olive leaves extracts led to more attenuation effect against diazinon toxicity. Additionally, these new findings suggest that the effect <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and olive leaves extracts and their combination against toxicity of diazinon may be due to antioxidant properties of their chemical constituents. Finally, the present study indicated that the <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and olive leaves and their combination can be considered as promising therapeutic agents against hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and metabolic disorders induced by diazinon and maybe by other toxicants and pathogenic factors...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a complex}} endocrine and metabolic disorder, which is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. Regarding to the antioxidant properties <b>of</b> green <b>tea</b> (Camellia sinensis) compounds, {{the present study was}} done to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> aqueous <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> green <b>tea</b> and catechin on the status of sex hormones and ovaries in polycystic ovarian syndrome rat model. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 42 Wistar female rats were divided into 7 equal groups of control, PCOS control, PCOS treated with aqueous <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> green <b>tea</b> (50 and 100 mg/kg, 24 days, ip), PCOS treated with catechin (50 and 100 mg/kg, 24 days, ip) and PCOS treated with clomiphene citrate (1. 5 mg/kg, 24 days, ip). Polycystic ovarian syndrome was induced by a single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate (4 mg/kg). At the end of administration period, serum level of LH, FSH, β-estradiol, Progesterone, and testosterone was measured using ELISA. Also, the number of ovarian follicles was counted. The obtained data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc Tukey statistical tests. Results: Compared to PCOS control group, serum level of LH, β-estradiol, testosterone and number of cystic follicles in the groups treated with clomiphene citrate, treated with 100 mg/kg aqueous <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> green <b>tea</b> and treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of catechin significantly decreased, but serum level of FSH, progesterone and number of preantral, antral, preovulatory follicles, and corpus luteum significantly increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Compared with green tea, catechin has a more favorable effect on improving hormonal parameters, especially FSH hormone and increasing the number of ovarian follicles in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Major {{chemical}} compounds in different extracts from tea flowers (Camellia sinensis) were analyzed. Distilled water or 70 % ethanol extracts were then fractionated with chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, respectively. Each extract fraction was tested its scavenging activities on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl free radicals. The {{results showed that}} ethyl acetate fraction <b>of</b> ethanol-extract <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> flower (EEA) exhibited the highest quenching activity to hydroxyl radicals (SC 50 11. 6 µg/ml), followed by ethanol-extract (EE) <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> flower (SC 50 19. 7 µg/ml). Same tea flower extract showed big different scavenging activities on different free radicals. EEA quenched 80 % of hydroxyl radicals generated by Fenton’s reaction, however, only 40 % of DPPH radical was scavenged in the Fe (II) -H 2 O 2 -luminol system. The contents of flavones, polyphenols and catechins in EE and EEA fractions were higher than those in other fractions. We suggest that the stronger scavenging abilities to free radicals {{might be due to}} polyphenols, EGCG, ECG and flavones. However, the water <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> flower and their fractions showed lower antioxidant activity for their inhibitory effect on hydroxyl radicals and DPPH radicals.
