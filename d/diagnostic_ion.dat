Differentiation of isoAsp and Asp residues is a challenging task owing to their similar properties and identical molecular mass. It was recently shown {{that they can be}} differentiated using ion-electron or ion-ion interaction fragmentation methods (ExD) because these methods provide diagnostic fragments c + 57 and z(center dot) - 57 specific to the isoAsp residue. To date, however, the presence of such fragments has not been explored on peptides with an N-terminal isoAsp residue. To address this question, several N-terminal isoAsp-containing peptides were analyzed using ExD methods alone or combined with chromatography. A diagnostic fragment [M + 2 H - 74](+center dot) was observed for the doubly charged precursor ions with N-terminal isoAsp residues. For some peptides, identification of the N-terminal isoAsp residue was challenging because of the low <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> peak intensity and the presence of interfering peaks. Supplemental activation was used to improve <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> detection.

The mechanism of this gas phase condensation reaction has been studied. Evidence of the (1 -methyleneimino) - 1 -ethenylium ion (m/z 54), formed upon the reaction of acetonitrile with itself, adding across the double bond in a [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is observed. When this nascent complex undergoes collision-induced dissociation, two <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> emerge.

As {{the study of}} post-translational modifications (PTMs) by means of shotgun proteomics progresses in depth and cov-erage, the ability to correctly identify PTM-bearing peptides is essential, increasing the demand for advanced data in-terpretation. Several PTMs are known to generate unique fragment ions during tandem mass spectrometry, the so-called <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions,</b> which unequivocally identify a given mass spectrum as related to a specific PTM. Although such ions offer tremendous analytical advantages, algorithms to decipher MS/MS spectra {{for the presence of}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> in an unbiased manner are currently lacking. Here, we present a systematic spectral-pattern-based approach for the discovery of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> and new fragmentation mechanisms in shotgun proteomics datasets.

40|$|Amyloid beta {{peptides}} are {{the major}} components of the vascular and plaque amyloid filaments in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although it is still unclear what initiates the disease, isomerization of aspartic acid residues in A beta peptides {{is directly related to}} the pathology of AD. The detection of isomerization products is analytically challenging, due to their similar chemical properties and identical molecular mass. Different methods have been applied to differentiate and quantify the isomers, including immunology, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Typically, those methods require comparative analysis with the standard peptides and involve many sample preparation steps. To understand the role of A beta isomerization in AD progression, a fast, simple, accurate, and reproducible method is necessary. In this work, electron capture dissociation (ECD) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) was applied to detect isomerization in A beta peptides. ECD generated diagnostic fragment ions for the two isomers of A beta 17 - 28, [M + 2 H - 60](+center dot) and z(6) (center dot) - 44 when aspartic acid was present and z(6) (center dot) - 57 when isoaspartic acid was present. Additionally, the z. - 57 <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> was also observed in the electron ionization dissociation (EID) spectra of the modified A beta 17 - 28 fragment.

In conclusion, both ECD and EID can clearly determine the presence and the position of isoaspartic acid residues in amyloid beta peptides. The next step, therefore, is to apply this method to analyze samples of Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals in order to generate a better understanding of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} is {{a highly}} frequent post-translational modification. Glycosylation is actively involved in intermolecular and intercellular binding events {{that are important to}} a wide range of biological functions such as immunity and fertility. The unique functions of glycans are directly related to their structures. In order to fully characterize the structure of an unknown glycan, 5 levels of structural information is needed: sugar unit identity, anomeric configuration, linkage types, sequence, and branching location. One of the grand challenges limiting the advance of glycosciences is the lack of sensitive tools for detailed glycan structural analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful tool for structural analysis of carbohydrates with its high sensitivity and selectivity. MS 2 (two-stage tandem mass spectrometry) is most often adopted due to the wide availability of commercial instruments; however, glycan structural determination typically stops at the level of topology (relative location of sugar unites). The goal of this research is to develop a multiple stage tandem mass spectrometry approach toward a sensitive and full level structural analysis of linear oligosaccharides by obtaining information of individual sugar unit identity, anomeric configuration, linkage types, and sequence. This approach roots in the discovery of diagnostic ions, which are sub-structures of disaccharides and the fragmentation patterns of which can be linked to a specific level of structural information. An MS 3 screening method was developed and a new <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> (Z 1) for linkage determination was established for the first time. With the use of another <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> (non-reducing sugar glycosidically linked to glycolaldehyde, m/z 221) discovered by Bendiak group, identity, anomeric information, and linkage position of the non-reducing sugar within a disaccharide can be determined from MS 3 experiments.

The strategy of diagnostic ions was further demonstrated on model linear oligosaccharides using MSn (n = 3 - 5) for full level structural determination. ...|$|E

Using HOCl-oxidized lysozyme as a model system, {{it was found that the}} immonium ions of oxidized tyrosine and tryptophan formed in MS 2 analysis could not be used as <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions,</b> owing to the occurrence of isobaric fragment ions from unmodified peptides. Using a double quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, precursor ion scanning was combined with detection of MS 3 fragment ions from the immonium ions and collisionally-activated decomposition peptide sequencing to achieve selectivity for the oxPTMs. For chlorotyrosine, the immonium ion at 170. 1 m/z fragmented to yield <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> at 153. 1, 134. 1, and 125. 1 m/z, and the hydroxytyrosine immonium ion at 152. 1 m/z gave <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> at 135. 1 and 107. 1 m/z.

40|$|Although {{differentiation}} of the isomeric Asn deamidation products (Asp and isoAsp) at the peptide level by electron capture dissociation (ECD) has been well-established, isoAsp identification at the intact protein level remains a challenging task. Here, a comprehensive top-down deamidation study is presented using the protein beta 2 -microglobulin (β 2 M) {{as the model}} system. Of the three deamidation sites identified in the aged β 2 M, isoAsp formation was detected at only one site by the top-down ECD analysis. The absence of diagnostic ions likely resulted from an increased number of competing fragmentation channels and a decreased likelihood of product ion separation in ECD of proteins. To overcome this difficulty, an MS 3 approach was applied where a protein ion was first fragmented by collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and the resulting product ion was isolated and further analyzed by ECD. IsoAsp formation at all three deamidation sites was successfully identified by this CAD-ECD approach.

Furthermore, tens of other components were identified with an average similarity of > 920 (on the 0 - 999 scale), including 10 other endogenous sterols, and full mass spectra of 5, 000 + compounds were retained. The testosterone/epitestosterone ratio was obtained from the same run. A new dimension in doping analysis has been implemented by addressing separation improvement. Instead of increasing the method sensitivity, which is accompanied by making the detector increasingly "blind" to the matrix (as represented by selected ion monitoring mode, high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS), the method capabilities have been improved by adding a new "separation" dimension while retaining full mass spectral scan information.

40|$|Quadrupole {{ion trap}} mass {{spectrometry}} has been evaluated for its potential use in vehicle emissions measurements in vehicle test facilities as an analyzer {{for the top}} 15 compounds contributing to smog generation. A variety of ionization methods were explored including ion trap in situ chemical ionization, atmospheric sampling glow discharge ionization, and nitric oxide chemical ionization in a glow discharge ionization source coupled with anion trap mass spectrometer. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} determination of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons at parts per million to parts per billion levels. Ion trap in situ water chemical ionization and atmospheric sampling glow discharge ionization were both shown to be amenable to the analysis of arenes, alcohols, aldehydes and, to some degree, alkenes. Atmospheric sampling glow discharge also generated molecular ions of methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE). Neither of these ionization methods, however, were found to generate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> for the alkanes. Nitric oxide chemical ionization, on the other hand, was found to yield <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> for alkanes, alkenes, arenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and MTBE. The ability to measure a variety of hydrocarbons present at roughly 15 parts per billion at measurement rates of 3 Hz was demonstrated. These results have demonstrated that the ion trap has an excellent combination of sensitivity, specificity, speed, and flexibility with respect to the technical requirements of the top 15 analyzer...|$|R
40|$|Electron-transfer {{dissociation}} allows {{differentiation of}} isoaspartic acid and aspartic acid residues {{using the same}} c + 57 and z − 57 peaks that were previously observed with electron capture dissociation. These peaks clearly define both the presence and the position of isoaspartic acid residues and they are relatively abundant. The lower resolution of the ion trap instrument makes detection of the aspartic acid residue’s diagnostic peak difficult because of interference with side-chain fragment ions from arginine residues, but the aspartic acid residues are still clearly observed in the backbone cleavages and can be inferred from {{the absence of the}} isoaspartic acid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions...</b>|$|R

40|$|N-Methyl bis(2 -(alkyloxy-alkylphosphoryloxy) ethyl) amines, {{which are}} {{abbreviated}} as PNPs, are {{a series of}} new skeleton chemicals belonging to schedule 2. B. 04 chemicals of Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). PNPs are important markers of chemical warfare agents because they are structurally relative to both nerve agents and N-mustards. In this study, fragmentation path-ways of the most characteristic fragment ions in Q-TOF mass spectrometry were proposed based on the information from accurate mass and secondary fragmentations of product ions scan ex-periments. Results indicated that the base ion in LC/HRMS was the quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+. In LC-HRMS/MS, it was [M+H-CnH 2 n+ 1 P(O) (OH) CmH 2 m+ 1 O]+ fragment ion which was formed by losing an alkyloxy alkylphosphoryloxy group from the quasi-molecular ion. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> m/z 84. 0814 was identified as [C 5 H 10 N]+, which was the group of (CH 2 =CH) 2 N+(H) CH 3. PNPs have two protonated centers. One is on the N atom, the other is on the O atom (P=O). O-n-propyl PNPs generally exhibited two fragmentation pathways. Firstly, the quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+ lost a propoxy alkylphosphoryloxy group to produce [R 1 P(OH+) (O-n-C 3 H 7) OCH 2 CH 2 N(CH 3) CH=CH 2]+, which could be fragmented further to produce [C 5 H 10 N]+ ion. Secondly, [R 1 P(OH+) (O-n-C 3 H 7...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the growth of the carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) industry, there are no established analytical methods with which to detect or quantify CNTs in environmental matrices. Given that CNTs have relatively high thermal stabilities, we investigated the use of thermal techniques to isolate and quantify single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Test materials included ten types of commercial SWCNTs, representative biological macromolecules (bovine serum albumin and methylcellulose), soot, natural coastal sediments, and SWCNT-amended sediments. Different SWCNTs exhibited widely diverse degradation temperatures, and thermal analytical methods may require SWCNT-type specific parameters. To improve quantification capabilities, evolved gases were monitored by mass spectrometry. SWCNTs produced <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> ratios reflective of their high carbon and low hydrogen and oxygen contents. Current detection limits are roughly 4 μgSWCNT per sample (e. g., 100 μgSWCNT g– 1 sediment and 40 mg sample), controlled by interfering ions associated with the instrument’s non-airtight design. Although future modifications could improve this limitation, the current method is sufficient for quantifying SWCNTs in laboratories and industrial sites where SWCNTs are handled. Furthermore, the method shows promise to distinguish between incidental (e. g., soot) and engineered (e. g., SWCNTs) nanoparticles, which is not possible with current state-of-the-art techniques.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from acquired {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} develop autoantibodies directed toward the plasma glycoprotein ADAMTS 13. Here, we studied the glycan composition of plasma-derived ADAMTS 13. Purified ADAMTS 13 was reduced, alkylated, and processed into peptides with either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Glycopeptides were enriched using zwitterionic HILIC zip-tips and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry employing higher-energy collision dissociation fragmentation. Upon detection of a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ion</b> of a glycan fragment, electron transfer dissociation fragmentation {{was performed on the}} same precursor ion. The majority of N-linked glycans were of the complex type containing terminal sialic acids and fucose residues. A high mannose-containing glycan was attached to Asn 614 in the spacer domain. Six O-linked glycans mostly terminating in sialic acid were found dispersed over ADAMTS 13. Five O-linked glycans were attached to a Ser and one to Thr. All 6 O-linked glycans contained a terminal sialic acid. O-fucosylation is a common posttranslational modification of thrombospondin type 1 repeats. We identified 7 O-fucosylation sites in the thrombospondin (TSP) type 1 repeats. Unexpectedly, one additional O-fucosylation site was found in the disintegrin domain. This O-fucosylation site did not meet the proposed consensus sequence CSX(S/T) CG. C-mannosylation sites were identified in TSP 1, linker TSP 4 -TSP 5, and TSP 8. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of glycan modifications on ADAMTS 13, which may have implications for its interaction with immune- or clearance receptors containing carbohydrate recognition domain...|$|E
40|$|A tunable ESI-MS/MS {{strategy}} for differentiation of flavone and flavanone diglycoside isomers based on metal complexation with auxiliary ligands is reported. The {{addition of a}} metal salt and an auxiliary ligand to a flavonoid solution results {{in the formation of}} [M(II) (flavonoid-H) auxiliary ligand]+ complexes, where M(II) is a transition metal. A series of auxiliary ligands with electron-withdrawing substituents were synthesized to tailor the relative metal binding affinities of the ligands and thus directly influence the stabilities, and consequently the dissociation pathways, of the complexes. Upon collisionally activated dissociation, the complexes yield fragmentation patterns in which the abundances of key <b>diagnostic</b> <b>ions</b> are enhanced, thus facilitating isomer differentiation...|$|R
