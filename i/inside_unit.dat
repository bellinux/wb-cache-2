In the early hours of 12 March, TEPCO reported that radiation levels were rising in the turbine building for Unit 1 and that it was considering venting some of the mounting pressure into the atmosphere, which could result in the release of some radioactivity. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano stated later in the morning the amount of potential radiation would be small and that the prevailing winds were blowing out to sea. At 02:00 JST, the pressure inside the reactor containment was reported to be 600 kPa (6 bar or 87 psi), 200 kPa higher than under normal conditions. At 05:30 JST, the pressure inside Reactor 1 was reported to be 2.1 times normal levels, 820 kPa. Isolation cooling ceased to operate between midnight and 11:00 JST 12 March, at which point TEPCO started relieving pressure and injecting water. One employee working <b>inside</b> <b>Unit</b> 1 at this time received a radiation dose of 106 mSv and was later sent to a hospital to have his condition assessed.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press {{reports that}} two PackBot ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the {{crippled}} Fukushima {{nuclear power plant}} and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49mSv/h <b>inside</b> <b>unit</b> 1 and up to 57mSv/h <b>inside</b> <b>unit</b> 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant {{by the end of}} this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually [...] "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.|$|E

The reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) was successfully activated for Unit 3; however, the Unit 3 RCIC subsequently failed, and at about 09:00 on March 13, the nuclear fuel had melted into corium. Unit 2 retained RCIC functions slightly longer and corium is not believed to have started to pool on the reactor floor until around 18:00 on March 14.

Though she successfully disables all nine opponents, Unit 02's power running out and the infinite power of the Mass-Produced Evas' S² Engines (which allow them to remain functional despite being severely damaged or mutilated) finally allow them to eviscerate and dismember Unit 02 using their Lance of Longinus replicas. Shinji then prepares to start the Third Impact in an indeterminate scene, he confronts Asuka, who argues with him and rejects his pleas for her to help him - at which point he begins to strangle her, and the Third Impact/Instrumentality begins.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a new {{systematic}} design methodology {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous energy and water minimization in multiple-contaminant systems that also feature maximum re-use of water. In addition to allowing re-use of water in multiple-contaminant systems, issues about heat losses and flowrate changes <b>inside</b> <b>unit</b> operations have also been incorporated in this new design method. To implement such a design, two new design aspects are introduced; new method for “Non-isothermal Mixing ” point identification and new “Separate System ” generation. The first aspect involves “non-isothermal mixing”, which enables direct heat recovery between water streams, and therefore allows {{the reduction of the}} number of heat transfer units. The other aspect is the generation of “separate system “in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-effective series of heat-exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams. The new design aspects have been illustrated with two examples...|$|E

In this study, the electrical behavior of La 0. 5 Li 0. 5 TiO 3 (LLTO- 05) perovskite and Li 1. 2 Ti 1. 8 Al 0. 2 (PO 4) 3 (LTAP 0 - 02) NASICON compounds was investigated. In both systems a three-dimensional network of conduction paths is present. In the Li-rich LLTO- 05 sample, lithium and La are randomly distributed on A-sites of perovskites, but in LTAP 0 - 02 Li and cation vacancies are preferentially disposed at M 1 and M 2 sites. In perovskite compounds, local motions produced <b>inside</b> <b>unit</b> cells {{are responsible for the}} large >near constant loss> regime detected at low temperatures, however, in the case of NASICON compounds, local motions not participating in long-range charge transport were not detected. In both analyzed systems long-range correlated motions are responsible for dc-conductivity values of ceramic grains near 10 - 3 S cm- 1 at room temperature, indicating that low-temperature local motions, producing large NCL contribution, are not required to achieve the highest ionic conductivities.

40|$|AbstractThe {{technological}} frontier {{is ripe for}} action on the cycle of municipal waste at local level through the optimization of existing treatment processes, adapting to European Union directives. The study concerns {{the analysis of the}} waste cycle in order to rationalize the current paths of the waste by adapting to EU directives, {{with a view of the}} entire supply chain - from the delivery to the energy production (WtE, Waste to Energy) – with a intermediate stage of SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel) production. The DIMA has developed an innovative platform for MSW treatment (unsorted and not), based on newly developed technologies that enables its weight and volume reduction and the transformation in SRF high quality, by achieving consistent chemical-physical and particle size parameters through the innovative technology of mechanochemical micronization. This standardized fuel product is therefore suitable for energy recovery within the platform using the most advanced gasification process. The study aims at developing a mobile demonstration plant of 100 - 200 kWe for energy recovery from waste in cogeneration by conversion of MSW into SRF through a system of characterization, treatment and recycling based on a highly innovative mechanochemical refining system. The SRF is enhanced through more advanced gasification process and it can used for the production of electricity and thermal energy. The production, the gasification and the syngas combustion take place in modular units arranged in appropriate mobile units (containers) appropriately configured, to fully meet the objectives of a sustainable policy management and security of waste. b Unit 1 (waste treater - SRF producer) is developed to operate the transformation of industrial waste in SRF for subsequent gasification <b>inside</b> <b>unit</b> 2 (Boiler Gasifier). It carries out a pre-treatment and mechanochemical micronization waste treatment. The SRF is reduced into pellets to be introduced into the 2 (boiler gasifier) to its gasification (syngas production). The pellet (auxiliary unit 4, pellettizer) is gasified in the unit 2 and enriched in order to obtain synmethan gas for producing electricity in the cogeneration unit 3 (energies production) ...|$|E
