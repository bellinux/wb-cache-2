40|$|International audienceDecentralization {{policies}} around {{forest management}} {{in developing countries}} such as India have received {{a large amount of}} attention in the recent past. But invariability analysis has been limited to the specificities of policies and to what extent they have provided forest produce benefits or not to forest-dependent communities. Public policies around forests must be contextualized and analysed in abroader historical context that attempts to understand what 'forests" mean to local communities in their segmented forms and how such policies have been part of a wider process of transformation of the agrarian landscape. This paper based on on-going research in three states of the Western Ghats of South India examines the historical transformation of the agrarian landscape and how recent public policies in the name of decentralization often fall short not only in their implementation but also in their vision. Hence, while decentralized forest management might open up spaces for communities to adress some of their forest needs in particular contexts, they are as likely to marginalize other needs in the process of redefining the agrarian landscape in the name of <b>environemental</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the legal regime of water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> {{in the light}} of Serbian, foreign and European law. Different divisions of water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> are carried out (to public and private ones, natural and artificial ones, etc.), with determination of their legal relevance. Account is taken of the issue of protection from harmful effects of waters to such facilities, as well. The paper points also to rules on the water <b>management</b> <b>facilities,</b> from acts of planning, to individual administrative acts and measures for maintenance of required qualitative and quantitative condition of waters, depending on their purpose (general use or special, commercial use o waters). Albeit special rules on water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> exist, due to the natural interlocking between all the components of the environment (water, air and soil), a comprehensive approach is required. A reference is made to other basic principles of protection of water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> as well, such as the principle of prevention, principle of sustainable development and the principle "polluter pays". The last one represents the achievement of contemporary law, which deviates from the idea accepted {{in the second half of}} 20 th century that supported the socialization of risk from harmful effects of waters...|$|R
