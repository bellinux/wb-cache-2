40|$|This study {{investigated}} the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (<b>gallotannins)</b> isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to <b>gallotannins</b> than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of <b>gallotannins</b> against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0. 2 g liter− 1 or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0. 5 to 1 g liter− 1, and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward <b>gallotannins.</b> Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of <b>gallotannins</b> against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward <b>gallotannins</b> than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1. 460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e. g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG 1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and {{in the presence of}} heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that <b>gallotannins</b> influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of <b>gallotannins</b> are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins...|$|R

40|$|In this study, Chinese <b>gallotannins</b> were {{characterized}} by MALDI-TOF MS, and effects of cationization reagents {{on the quality of}} spectra were investigated. The trideca- and tetradeca-galloyl glucoses were observed in Chinese <b>gallotannins,</b> which could not be detected in earlier studies. When Cs+ was used as the cationization reagent, Chinese <b>gallotannins</b> gave a relatively simple MALDI-TOF spectrum, three series of quasimolecular ions [M + Cs](+), [M + 2 Cs-H](+), and [M + 3 Cs- 2 H](+) and a series of metastable ion peaks with minimum abundance were detected. Selection of Na+ as the cationization reagent, additional three series of ion peaks including two patterns from the fragmentation and complex 2 M adducts [2 M + Na](+) can be distinguished. In the case of no deionization or addition of cationization reagent to the analyte/ matrix, naturally abundant Na+ and K+ as the cationization reagent, [M + Na](+) and [M + K](+) molecular ions both appeared in the complicated spectrum.

40|$|Excessive {{activation}} of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP 1) leads to NAD+ depletion and cell death during ischemia and other conditions that generate extensive DNA damage. When activated by DNA strand breaks, PARP 1 uses NAD+ as substrate to form ADP-ribose polymers on specific acceptor proteins. These polymers are in turn rapidly degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a ubiquitously expressed exo- and endoglycohydrolase. In this study, {{we examined the}} role of PARG in the PARP 1 -mediated cell death pathway. Mouse neuron and astrocyte cultures were exposed to hydrogen peroxide, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), or the DNA alkylating agent, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Cell death in each condition was markedly reduced by the PARP 1 inhibitor benzamide and equally reduced by the PARG inhibitors <b>gallotannin</b> and nobotanin B. The PARP 1 inhibitor benzamide and the PARG inhibitor <b>gallotannin</b> both prevented the NAD+ depletion that otherwise results from PARP 1 activation by MNNG or H 2 O 2. However, these agents had opposite effects on protein poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation. Immunostaining for poly(ADP-ribose) on Western blots and neuron cultures showed benzamide to decrease and <b>gallotannin</b> to increase poly(ADP-ribose) accumulation during MNNG exposure. These results suggest that PARG inhibitors do not inhibit PARP 1 directly, but instead prevent PARP 1 -mediated cell death by slowing the turnover of poly(ADP-ribose) and thus slowing NAD+ consumption. PARG {{appears to be a}} necessary component of the PARP-mediated cell death pathway, and PARG inhibitors may have promise as neuroprotective agents...|$|E

40|$|CXCR 3 is {{involved}} in numerous inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, allograft rejection and inflammatory bowel disease. There is a strong and growing demand for novel and effective therapeutics that can mediate CXCR 3 activity. In this study, a set of botanical compounds and a peptide mimetic of the second extracellular loop (ECL- 2) of CXCR 3 were examined for the ability to inhibit interactions between CXCR 3 and its ligands in a murine model. EGCG, a green tea polyphenol, and <b>gallotannin,</b> derived from many plant sources, strongly inhibited the chemotaxis of stably transfected murine CXCR 3 -expressing L 1. 2 cells in response to murine CXCL 9, CXCL 10, and CXCL 11. EGCG was also shown to bind directly to murine CXCR 3 ligands with high affinities. Baicalin, a flavonoid found in the medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis, and ginkgolide A, from the Ginkgo biloba tree, did not significantly reduce cell migration towards murine CXCR 3 ligands, nor did the peptide mimetic of the ECL- 2 of murine CXCR 3. Other green tea polyphenols similar in structure to EGCG were also analyzed and were less able to inhibit murine CXCR 3 ligand-mediated chemotaxis than EGCG, with the following efficacies: ECG > EGC > EC. It was observed that the most effective test compounds contained more hydroxyl groups and hence were more negatively charged, similar to glycosaminoglycans, which are extracellular matrix components that bind many chemokines. It is possible that EGCG and <b>gallotannin</b> are able to bind the GAG-binding domains of murine CXCR 3 ligands, which allows them to prevent receptor binding and inhibit their function. This possibility represents the public health relevance of this research, as EGCG and <b>gallotannin</b> may be attractive candidates as lead compounds for new therapeutics for CXCR 3 -mediated and other inflammatory diseases...|$|E

The MALDI-ToF-MS analysis allowed us to ascertain the presence of hydrolysable tannins in both Astronium species as a series of <b>gallotannins</b> with degrees of polymerization of 7 to 13 galloyl units.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been suggested}} to explain why invasive exotic plants dramatically increase their abundance upon transport to a new range. The novel weapons hypothesis argues that phytotoxins secreted by roots of an exotic plant are more effective against naïve resident competitors in the range being invaded. The common reed Phragmites australis has a diverse population structure including invasive populations that are noxious weeds in North America. P. australis exudes the common phenolic gallic acid, which restricts the growth of native plants. However, the pathway for free gallic acid production in soils colonized by P. australis requires further elucidation. Here, we show that exotic, invasive P. australis contain elevated levels of polymeric <b>gallotannin</b> relative to native, noninvasive P. australis. We hypothesized that polymeric <b>gallotannin</b> can be attacked by tannase, an enzymatic activity produced by native plant and microbial community members, to release gallic acid in the rhizosphere and exacerbate the noxiousness of P. australis. Native plants and microbes were found to produce high levels of tannase while invasive P. australis produced very little tannase. These results suggest that both invasive and native species participate in signaling events that initiate the execution of allelopathy potentially linking native plant and microbial biochemistry to the invasive traits of an exotic species...|$|E
