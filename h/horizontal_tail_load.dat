40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{major issues}} associated with maneuvering of the aircraft inverted flight (acrobatic). It was presented mathematical description for longitudinal balance of the airplane for inverted flight, in particular, the pitching moment coefficient plane without power for horizontal rudder (Cmbu), {{as well as the}} same force on the rudder horizontal (PHo). An analysis was conducted for gusts acting on the plane flying in an inverted position in relation to the flight envelope. It has also been analysed the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> <b>load,</b> acting on the inverted fly and caused by both gusts and brutal control. In conclusions, the comments on the aerodynamics of wing in flight inverted for the selected airfoil are presented. The focus is on static analysis of longitudinal balance of the airplane under normal inverted flight. Dynamic considerations, taking into account the impact of inertia on the load structure, were not carried out. Dynamic issues will be given in a separate publication.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{wind tunnel}} model was tested to investigate new component concepts utilizing spanwise blowing to provide improved maneuver characteristics for advanced fighter aircraft. Primary {{emphasis was placed on}} high angle of attack performance, stability, and control at subsonic speeds. Spanwise blowing on a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing resulted in leading edge vortex enhancement with subsequent large vortex-induced lift increments and drag polar improvements at the higher angles of attack. Small deflections of a leading edge flap delayed these lift and drag benefits to higher angles of attack. In addition, blowing was more effective at higher Mach numbers. Spanwise blowing in conjunction with a deflected trailing edge flap resulted in lift and drag benefits that exceeded the summation of the effects of each high lift device acting alone. Asymmetric blowing was an effective lateral control device at the higher angles of attack. Spanwise blowing on the wing reduced <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> <b>loading</b> and improved the lateral-directional stability characteristics of a wing-horizontal tail-vertical tail configuration...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of a large movable <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> surface to the control system of a rotorcraft in-flight simulator being developed from a Sikorsky UH- 60 A Black Hawk Helicopter is evaluated. The capabilities of the control surface as a trim control and as an active control are explored. The helicopter dynamics are modeled using the Generic Helicopter simulation program developed by Sikorsky Aircraft. The effect of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> on the helicopter trim envelope is examined by plotting trim maps of the aircraft attitude and controls {{as a function of}} the flight speed and <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> incidence. The control power of the tail surface relative to that of the other controls is examined by comparing control derivatives extracted from the simulation program over the flight speed envelope. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail's</b> contribution as an active control is evaluated using an explicit model following control synthesis involving a linear model of the helicopter in steady, level flight at a flight speed of eighty knots. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> is found to provide additional control flexibility in the longitudinal axis.

40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{unsteady}} Navier-Stokes equations are numerically solved {{to simulate}} the aerodynamic interaction of rotor, canard and <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> in hover based on moving chimera grid. The variations of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments of the canard and <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> {{with respect to the}} rotor azimuth are analyzed with the deflection angle set at 0 ° and 50 °, respectively. The pressure map of aerodynamic surfaces and velocity vector distribution of flow field are investigated to get better understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic interaction. The result shows that the canard and <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> present different characteristics under the downwash of the rotor. The canard produces much vertical force loss with low amplitude fluctuation. Contrarily, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail,</b> which is within the flow field induced by the down wash of the rotor, produces only less vertical force loss, but the amplitudes of the lift and pitching moment are larger, implying that a potential deflection angle scheme in hover is 50 ° for the canard and 0 ° for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail...</b>|$|R

The complete tail was mounted in the tunnel on a 3 deg conical support body. Various configurations were investigated. A loss in damping of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> at transonic speeds was shown by both tunnel and flight tests. The loss in damping extended over a greater Mach number range and the maximum loss occurred at a higher Mach number in the tunnel tests. Large-amplitude oscillations of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> of the basic configuration which occurred at low supersonic Mach numbers appeared to be primarily due to the vertical tail of the basic configuration and the interference effects associated with this tail. Secondary factors contributing {{to the development of the}} large-amplitude oscillations of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> of the basic configuration were probably the loss in damping of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>tail</b> at transonic speeds and the turbulence of the airstream itself...|$|R
