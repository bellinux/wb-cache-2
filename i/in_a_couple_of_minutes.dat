25|$|Taichung-Changhua Expressway (中彰快速道路,) is {{the main}} stretch of Provincial Highway No. 74 that runs from northwestern Taichung City into the {{northern}} part of Changhua City just to the south of Taichung. At some points, it is just a few dozen meters east of the Sun Yat-Sen Freeway. While it does not connect directly to that highway, it does have an interchange with National Highway No. 3 (國道三號) in Wuri District, where one can then access it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decay of}} {{a mixture of}} two or more {{materials}} which each decay exponentially, but with different half-lives, is not exponential. Mathematically, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. A common example of such a situation is the waste of nuclear power stations, which is a mix of substances with vastly different half-lives. Consider a mixture of a rapidly decaying element A, with a half-life of 1 second, and a slowly decaying element B, with a half-life of 1 year. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> almost all atoms of element A will have decayed after repeated halving of the initial number of atoms, but very few of the atoms of element B will have done so as {{only a tiny fraction of}} its half-life has elapsed. Thus, the mixture taken as a whole will not decay by halves.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing...
