5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the <b>fuel</b> <b>strainer</b> chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
50|$|A gascolator, {{also known}} as a main line strainer, {{sediment}} bowl or <b>fuel</b> <b>strainer,</b> acts primarily as a fuel drain for water and small particles of sediment and is usually found at the lowest point of an aircraft's fuel system. The gascolator is located below the level of the aircraft's carburetor and fuel tanks and on light aircraft is commonly located {{on the front of the}} firewall, as low as possible.|$|E

5000|$|Conyngham {{suffered}} a severe fire on 8 May 1990, while conducting pre-deployment operations off the Virginia coast. A major fuel oil fire erupted from the ship's Forward Fire Room into the ship's superstructure, isolating the crew forward and aft, requiring an all-hands effort to extinguish it. The ship {{had just completed}} a maintenance availability and a <b>fuel</b> oil <b>strainer</b> had not been assembled properly by a contractor and not inspected to verify assembly by ships company. The result was that the assembly failed catastrophically and started a fuel oil fire that raged for twenty-three hours, caused an officer to die, 18 other sailors to be injured and the ship to be decommissioned shortly thereafter.
