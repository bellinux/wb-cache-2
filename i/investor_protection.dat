40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the way <b>investor</b> <b>protections</b> {{in international trade}} agreements may affect the division of power over environmental and land use regulation among federal, state, and local governments in the United States.

Professor Been predicts that domestic property owners will use <b>investor</b> <b>protections</b> in international trade agreements to argue for more expansive takings protections under the Fifth Amendment.

40|$|Investors {{can access}} foreign {{diversification}} opportunities through either {{foreign portfolio investment}} (FPI) or foreign direct investment (FDI). The worldwide tax regime employed by the U. S. potentially distorts this choice by penalizing FDI, relative to FPI, in low-tax countries. On the other hand, weak <b>investor</b> <b>protections</b> in foreign countries may increase the value of control, creating an incentive to use FDI rather than FPI. By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI, this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflects these incentives to bypass home and host country institutional regimes. The {{results suggest that the}} residual tax on US multinational firms’ foreign earnings skews the composition of outbound capital flows - a 10 % decrease in a foreign country’s corporate tax rate increases US investors’ equity FPI holdings by approximately 10 %, controlling for effects on FDI. <b>Investor</b> <b>protections</b> also seem to shape portfolio choices, though these results are not robust when only withincountry variation is employed.

40|$|In July of 1826, several {{prominent}} Wall Street firms abruptly went bankrupt, amid scandalous revelations of fraudulent financial practices by their management.

Subsequent to the expropriation, Lauder employed international agreements and tribunals to recoup 354. 9 million USD from the Czech Republic. This clinical examination of an expropriation and its aftermath illustrates how ownership shares can be of secondary importance in determining control, how corporate control is shaped by geography, and how differential access to <b>investor</b> <b>protections</b> in global capital markets can contribute to the persistence of differences, rather than convergence, in <b>investor</b> <b>protections...</b>|$|R
