5|$|Mölders joined an {{infantry}} regiment of the Reichswehr in Allenstein, East Prussia on 1 April 1931. After {{completing his}} basic military training in October 1932, {{he transferred to}} the Military School Dresden. On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to ensign. He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the Pioneer School in Munich. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and was given conditional permission (bedingt tauglich—with constraints) to begin flight training.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the {{autonomous}} Arab {{ruler of the}} Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. In order to build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but {{did not succeed in}} taking the city. In 1773, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.|$|E
25|$|After Meinhard died in 1196, {{his place}} {{was taken by}} Berthold. Berthold tried to convert the Livonians by force, {{launching}} two raids on Livonia. The first took place in 1196, but {{he was forced to}} retreat to Germany after being ambushed near Salaspils. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> in 1198, but this time he was killed by the Livonian soldier Ymaut.|$|E

25|$|McKeag {{retained}} {{his connection}} with the Liberal Party, holding the positions of President of Tynemouth Liberal Association and Vice –President of Newcastle Liberal Club and <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> {{to get back to}} Parliament as a Liberal in Newcastle North at the 1945 general election and in 1950 at Newcastle upon Tyne East but after this he seems to have become disillusioned with the prospects of the party.|$|E
25|$|German {{machine gun}} crews in the towers that guarded the western {{approach}} to the bridge opened up on the advancing American troops. At 3:20 pm, Friesenhahn made the last connections to the detonator and twisted the handle, but nothing happened. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and all they heard {{was the sound of}} American shells hitting the area around them. Both Friesenhahn and Bratge knew the dire consequences to them personally and to the German defensive situation if they failed to destroy the bridge.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, he {{was sent}} across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada to be interned in Camp W in Neys, Ontario, or Camp 30 in Bowmanville, Ontario. He made his first escape on 23 November, {{remaining}} at large for two days before being recaptured at Niagara Falls, Ontario. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> several weeks later, managing to reach Montreal's Windsor Station. On his third attempt, on 18 February 1942, {{he and a friend}} made it to Watertown, New York, United States, before being caught. He was then transferred to Camp 20 in Gravenhurst, Ontario, where he made two further unsuccessful breakouts.|$|E

25|$|Because Reinhardt and {{his family}} were Gypsies, and he was also a jazz musician, he tried to escape from {{occupied}} France with his family. After his first attempt, he survived when a secretly jazz-loving German, Luftwaffe officer Dietrich Schulz-Köhn, let him go back to France after he was captured. But still desperate to get out of France, knowing that Gypsies were being rounded up and killed in concentration camps, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> to cross into Switzerland a few days later, this time in the dead of night. But he was stopped by Swiss border guards who forced him to return to Paris.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes {{had already}} {{tried and failed}} to get a mining {{concession}} from Lobengula, king of the Ndebele of Matabeleland. In 1888 <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again.</b> He sent John Moffat, son of the missionary Robert Moffat, who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes' proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the Rudd Concession, which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.|$|E
25|$|Piribauer {{tried to}} have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> {{the next day he}} was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his {{resignation}} to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over. Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia.|$|E

Although a police sniper eventually kills him, he does shoot Lee.|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} the Porto Bello {{operation}} led the British, in September 1740, to send a squadron under Commodore George Anson to attack Spain's possessions in the Pacific. Before they reached the Pacific, numerous men had died from disease, {{and they were in}} no shape to launch any sort of attack. Anson reassembled his force in the Juan Fernández Islands, allowing them to recuperate before he moved up the Chilean coast, raiding the small town of Paita. He reached Acapulco too late to intercept the yearly Manila galleon, which {{had been one of the}} principal objectives of the expedition. He retreated across the Pacific, running into a storm that forced him to dock for repairs in Canton. After this <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> the following year to intercept the Manila galleon. He accomplished this on 20 June 1743 off Cape Espiritu Santo, capturing more than a million gold coins.|$|E
25|$|While {{he worked}} {{to regain control}} of the Albertan, Bell also {{continued}} to invest in oil ventures. In 1944 he partnered with Frank McMahon and others forming Empire Petroleum Limited, in an unsuccessful attempt to raise capital to drill a wildcat well. Two years later <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> with two new companies, Reef Petroleum and Tower Petroleum. The two new companies also failed to find oil, but the efforts raised enough money for Bell and his partners to form Calvan Petroleums on the heels of Imperial Oil's discovery of a large oil field at Redwater, Alberta. The company found success trading in leases and drilling rights on crown land, prompting Bell to form several other oil companies in the years that followed. In 1951, Bell amalgamated his various companies into Calvan Consolidated Ltd. The new company held an interest in 77 wells at the Redwater field. He sold Calvan to Petrofina in 1955 for $40 million and, while he continued to trade in oil and gas companies for several years, his focus returned to the newspaper business.|$|E
500|$|Until 1938, Fairbanks lacked paved streets. The town's {{dirt roads}} turned to dust {{in summer and}} thick mud in spring and fall, causing {{problems}} as Fairbanks' population grew in the 1930s. In 1937, the mayor of Fairbanks, E. B. Collins, proposed using a federal grant and city bonds to pave the roads, but he was turned down by voters. The next year, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and was successful. By 1940, the first [...] of paved road was complete.|$|E

The feather grows longer and helps Hawk to reach some earth under the waters. The water eventually receded.|$|R
500|$|On July 8, 1905, Bradley heard gunshots {{close to}} his {{waterfront}} home in Flamingo. [...] He set sail in his small skiff, and encountered a father and his two sons {{by the name of}} Smith, who were shooting up a rookery. The families had known each other for years, but Civil War veteran Walter Smith had a reputation for being troublesome, and Bradley had previously had altercations with him. [...] He had arrested Smith on one occasion and Smith's oldest son, Tom, twice for poaching. [...] Smith threatened to retaliate against Bradley if <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again,</b> reportedly telling the warden, [...] "You ever arrest one of my boys again, I'll kill you." ...|$|E
500|$|Waller marched from Farnham for Odiham and Alton, {{intending}} to occupy these towns while gradually approaching his objective, Basing. While not of great strategic importance, Basing's {{proximity to the}} main road between London, Salisbury, and Winchester made it worthy of attention. Marching toward Alton, Waller halted at Bentley Green on 3 November, where he determined his capabilities. [...] He marched further that day, but later retreated to Farnham. On 2 November, Waller attacked one hundred men of Bennett's at Alton. From 7–9 November, Waller laid siege to Basing House, but withdrew to Basingstoke in failure, with his soldiers near mutiny from poor weather conditions. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> {{on the night of}} 11 November, but retreated to Farnham to await Hopton's army.|$|E
500|$|Attempting to {{overcome}} the failure of his first contracting business following World War I, Dutton operated a second using the money he earned with the Tigers and Maroons. [...] It too failed in 1933 {{as a result of}} the Great Depression. In 1938, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again,</b> joining with Reg Jennings and his brother Jack to form the Standard Gravel and Surfacing Company in Calgary. [...] The company proved immensely successful during World War II, building numerous airports within Canada as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan as well as completing highways in northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. After serving a year as vice-chairman, Dutton was named the chairman of the prairie roadbuilders section of the Canadian Construction Association in 1950. By 1960, the company had become Standard Holdings Ltd., operating 20 different companies that had $70 million in contracts for that year alone, and Dutton had personally become a millionaire.|$|E

Dejected, Harold goes back home and finishes rewriting the script. Assuming that his screenwriting career is over before it began, Harold goes back to driving the tour bus.|$|R
500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
500|$|Zaphod's younger brother, Yossarian, {{is named}} after the main {{character}} in Catch-22 and has a scar across his left eye. In the third episode of the series, the narrator states that Yossarian was once Flower's mate and the dominant male of the Whiskers, but Zaphod dethroned him before the series started. The [...] film states that Yossarian and Zaphod were once roving Lazuli males. Yossarian became the dominant male of the Whiskers when Flower's sister was the dominant female, and then left the group when Flower assumed the role. [...] Noted as having [...] "some social problems" [...] and being a trouble-maker, Yossarian initiated two burrow moves while babysitting twice in the first series, but both were badly handled. The first attempt resulted {{in a lot of}} confusion amongst the babysitters, resulting in the eight newborn pups Yossarian dragged out of the burrow being partially trampled and almost left to die in the desert sun. Pooky, one of the other babysitters, was able to restore order and get the pups to the burrow. A few days later <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>again.</b> [...] This time the babysitters joined him, but as they carried the newborn pups to a new burrow, they passed the main group and Flower and Zaphod ran after them. To avoid Flower's wrath, Yossarian dropped the pup of Mozart that he was carrying and slunk off. The pup died as a result {{and the rest of the}} Whiskers temporarily ostracised Yossarian for the havoc wrought by these moves. Yossarian's attempt to help Daisy by carrying her newborn pups to the Whiskers burrow separated him from the family. He also rescued one of Flower's pups in the second series after the young pup had wandered too far from the safety of the burrow.|$|E
