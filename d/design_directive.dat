The former have been demonstrated to be highly directive and possess low side lobes for a limited band of frequencies. We have recently demonstrated that a new solution applying so called “transformation optics/electromagnetic”, can be used to convert the conventional Luneburg lens into the same geometrical profile as those of FP resonator antennas, while maintain high directivity, low side lobe level, and an enhancement of the bandwidth of operation.

Advanced decision support tools require the most efficient optimization techniques, must be able to find the optimal investment path considering multiple scenarios, and should not only consider classic expansion strategies but also intelligent ones (e. g. energy storage and controlling active demand).

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS) is a {{well-established}} packet communication protocol that offers users a graphical position display {{system and a}} peer-to-peer textual message service. APRS is used in temporary and mobile networks where rapid deployment of infrastructure is required and limited a priori knowledge of the network topology is available. The APRS protocol {{can be used for}} emergencies and public service applications. ARPS, functioning as an access network, was originally designed to require low complexity and support high flexibility of a network. These <b>design</b> <b>directives</b> have limited APRS’s performance by resulting in low throughput and poor reliability. In order for APRS to be used in time-critical applications, these limitations would need to be improved. The thesis considers the limitations of ARPS by proposing an improved protocol stack with a substitution of the media access control (MAC) layer. The new protocol is modelled in order to develop a largely platform-independent implementation, which could be efficiently retargeted for different platforms. Lastly, a protocol performance evaluation is done {{in order to determine the}} resulting improvements on APRS and the overall viability of the proposal...|$|R
40|$|Ship design {{needs to}} respond to and attract an ever more design {{conscious}} society. However, {{little research has been}} conducted into perceptions of beauty and pleasure and how such perceptions can be usefully absorbed into ship design. Aesthetic consideration, is seen as a distraction from the bespoke nature of the ship design process and is often avoided, second guessed or left for external consultancy. The ship design discipline requires the nurturing of its own aesthetic methods, for future development, and to adapt some of the aesthetic ideals found in architecture, art and design. This paper argues that philosophy can be effective in interpreting what the passenger finds attractive and pleasurable. To illustrate the philosophical approach proposed, the `Elbe SWATH’ and the `Oasis of the Seas’ are investigated and compared using theoretical resources from the culturally focused philosophy of `Functional Beauty’. Conclusions suggest that the interpretation of the end users most valued appreciations can lead to <b>design</b> <b>directives</b> that deliver subjective qualities of beauty - beauty similar to those seen in the pure aims of the Elbe SWATH’s purposeful work craft, or comparable to nature’s beauty and purity in aim. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The article {{sheds light}} on {{introduction}} and content of Forest Regulation (1861). The idea of producing new Forest Regulation which would replace the existing act regulating same matter, introduced in 1857, came out {{as a result of}} people's discontent with limited opportunities for wood-cutting. The Committee for requests and proposals of so-called Saint Andrew's Day Assembly (1858), on which prince Alexander Karađorđević (1842 - 1858) had been dethroned and ex-prince Miloš Obrenović (1815 - 1839) reinstated to the throne, <b>designed</b> <b>directives</b> on which new forest legislation should have been based. Relying on these directives, in 1859 an unknown author made a Draft Forest Regulation consisting of 43 articles. In January 1861, the Draft was revised and supplemented by a three-membered committee formed by the State Council in the very end of 1860. The Council slightly altered the revised draft. Prince Mihailo Obrenović approved the text and it was enacted as Forest Regulation in 1861. In comparison with previous Forest Regulation, the act passed in 1861 was more liberal towards wood-cutting. Taxes on wood-cutting for economic purpose were lowered. Instead of Ministry of finances, district office was now competent to approve cutting wood for fodder. As a local authority, much more familiar with its fellow-inhabitants, district office was more likely to fulfill their exaggered wishes to destroy woods for above-mentioned purpose. The scope of population having right to be awarded piece of land with forest in order to broaden their insuficient landed property was widened. The reason for this step-back in forest protection in Serbia was obvious. New dinasty had to present itself as better than precedent government.
