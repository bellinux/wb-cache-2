5|$|A {{rerouting}} in late 1971 {{moved the}} US45 designation along M-26 between Rockland and <b>Greenland.</b> From <b>Greenland,</b> US45 followed Ontonagon–Greenland Road to Ontonagon. In late 1973, MDOT reversed the rerouting—US45 was {{restored to its}} previous routing on Rockland Road between Rockland and Ontonagon and M-26 was re-extended south from <b>Greenland</b> to Rockland; M-38 was extended west along Ontonagon–Greenland Road.|$|E
5|$|Air <b>Greenland</b> also {{performs}} charter flights within Europe {{on behalf}} of European travel agencies using its Airbus A330. In 2015, the decision voted by Greenland's governments to extend the runways of Nuuk and Ilulissat airports directly threatened the purpose of Air Greenland's single widebody aircraft. The A330 was only used from Pituffik and Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen Kastrup, but in January 2017, Air <b>Greenland</b> had announced more commercial routes to {{be covered by the}} aircraft between Iceland and <b>Greenland.</b> In March 2017, Air <b>Greenland</b> also announced adding more flights to Kangerlussuaq.|$|E
5|$|Air <b>Greenland</b> {{operates}} helicopter {{flights to}} most settlements in <b>Greenland</b> ("settlement flights") on {{contract with the}} government of <b>Greenland,</b> with the destination network subsidized and coordinated by the Ministry of Housing, Infrastructure and Transport.

5|$|The {{city has}} its own bus line, and is the northernmost year-round {{ice-free}} port in the country, a shipping base for western and northwestern <b>Greenland.</b> Supply ships head from the commercial port towards smaller settlements in more remote regions of Uummannaq Fjord, Upernavik Archipelago, {{and as far as}} Qaanaaq in northern <b>Greenland.</b> The town airport is served by Air <b>Greenland,</b> providing connections to other towns on the western coast of <b>Greenland,</b> and through Kangerlussuaq Airport, to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The first {{takeover}} of another airline {{took place on}} 28 July 2006: Air <b>Greenland</b> acquired the Danish carrier Air Alpha's <b>Greenland</b> subsidiary. Air Alpha <b>Greenland</b> had operated helicopter flights in Disko Bay and in eastern <b>Greenland.</b> Since the takeover, the acquired Bell 222 helicopters {{have been used for}} passenger transfers between Nerlerit Inaat Airport and Ittoqqortoormiit Heliport.|$|E

5|$|Air <b>Greenland</b> A/S, {{also known}} as Greenlandair, is the flag carrier airline of <b>Greenland,</b> jointly owned by the SAS Group (37.5%), the Greenlandic Government and the Danish Government. It {{operates}} a fleet of 32 aircraft, including 1 airliner used for transatlantic and charter flights, 9 fixed-wing aircraft primarily serving the domestic network, and 22 helicopters feeding passengers from the smaller communities into the domestic airport network. Flights to heliports in the remote settlements are operated on contract {{with the government of}} <b>Greenland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland's {{domestic}} {{airport network}} includes all 13 civilian airports within <b>Greenland.</b> Outside <b>Greenland,</b> the airline currently operates transatlantic flights to Keflavík International Airport in Iceland, Copenhagen Airport in Denmark and Iqaluit Airport in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance <b>Greenland</b> Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post <b>Greenland</b> moved a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha <b>Greenland.</b> In response, the company successfully pushed back against <b>Greenland</b> Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air <b>Greenland</b> and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E

5|$|As they {{sail for}} <b>Greenland,</b> strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach <b>Greenland</b> the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on <b>Greenland,</b> it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. <b>Greenland,</b> free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from <b>Greenland</b> towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|First Light {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of two protagonists, Peter, who lives {{with his mother and}} father in New York but is in <b>Greenland</b> for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an underground colony in <b>Greenland</b> called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in <b>Greenland</b> where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich events appear {{related to}} some, but not all, {{of the cold}} periods {{preceding}} the rapid warming events known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, which are best recorded in the NGRIP <b>Greenland</b> ice core. However, difficulties in synchronising marine sediment cores and <b>Greenland</b> ice cores to the same time scale cast aspersions on the accuracy of that statement.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{expansion}} is planned. In order {{to compete with}} Air Iceland, which operates service from Reykjavik Airport to Nuuk, Narsarsuaq, Ilulissat and {{the east coast of}} <b>Greenland</b> and now controls about 15% the market in Greenland-bound travel, Air <b>Greenland</b> may open a nonstop route between Nuuk and Keflavík International Airport in Iceland. Also, owing to improved technology and higher commodity prices, the Maarmorilik mines were due to reopen in November 2010 with zinc and iron ore reserves projected to last 50 years. As in the 1970s, the mine's supply flights to the mine will be operated by Air <b>Greenland,</b> using Bell helicopters (212s) based out of the Uummannaq Heliport.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Finn Øelund left to head Maersk Air and was {{replaced}} as CEO by Flemming Knudson. Air <b>Greenland</b> opened a route from Copenhagen to Akureyri in Iceland; the service lasted for six years before finally being deemed unprofitable and ended. Also in 2003, SAS abandoned its <b>Greenland</b> service, leading Air <b>Greenland</b> to purchase its second airliner, an Airbus A330-200 named Norsaq. (SAS briefly revived the service during the peak season in 2007 before dropping it again in January 2009.) Owing to SAS's withdrawal from the market, Air <b>Greenland</b> received its contract with the U.S. Air Force for passenger service to and from Thule Air Base. Running from February 2004, the contract was renewed for another five-year period in 2008 despite SAS's brief return to the market.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flemming Knudson {{was moved}} to head the Royal <b>Greenland</b> fishing concern and current CEO Michael Binzer was hired with a mandate to lead the company towards greater {{commercialisation}} and self-sufficiency under the Qarsoq 2012 ("Arrow 2012") plan. On 13 June, SAS announced its intention to sell its stake in Air <b>Greenland,</b> a move later incorporated into its restructuring programme, but as of 2012 it has not found any buyers. On 1 October, the airline introduced its e-ticket system. Also in 2007, Air <b>Greenland</b> began direct service with Baltimore/Washington International Airport in the United States of America. After sixty American visitors were stranded by a strike of Air <b>Greenland</b> employees and the company refused to make alternate arrangements for their return, ticket sales slumped and the route was closed in March 2008.|$|E

5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, <b>Greenland</b> and Russia. These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, <b>Greenland,</b> northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In <b>Greenland,</b> the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
