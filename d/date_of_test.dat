The {{aim of this}} research was to estimate the genetic parameters for these groups of fatty acids in bovine milk using multi-trait random regression test-day models. The relationship between these fatty acids and the milk production traits was also studied as well as the effects of season and stage of lactation. The model included as fixed effects: herd x <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> class of 15 days in milk, class of age. Random effects were herd x year of calving, permanent environmental, additive genetic, and residual effects. Since October 2007, all spectra generated by milk recording in the Walloon part of Belgium were collected. The {{contents of}} SAT and MONO were estimated by mid-infrared spectrometry. First results were obtained from 100, 841 test-day records from 11, 626 Holstein heifers. The season and stage of lactation influenced the contents of SAT and MONO in milk and milk fat. The heritability estimates of SAT and MONO in fat were higher {{at the beginning of the}} lactation. The negative energy balance of cows could explain this variation. The values of heritability were also higher at the end of lactation. The genetic and phenotypic correlations among studied traits varied also through the lactation.

The stearoyl Coenzyme-A desaturase 9 (delta- 9) gene was identified as a potential functional candidate gene affecting milk fat composition in dairy cattle. The objective of this research was to estimate the genetic parameters of delta- 9 activity indicator traits and to study the relationship between delta- 9 activity as described by these indicator traits and common milk production traits. A total of 126, 331 test-day records were obtained from 14, 259 Holstein (> 84 % Holstein gene) heifers belonging to 105 herds. The studied traits were milk yield, percentages of fat and protein, content of monounsaturated fatty acids, and 3 ratios reflecting the delta- 9 activity (C 14 : 1 / C 14 : 0; C 16 : 1 /C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 1 /C 18). The used model was a multiple-trait random regressions test-day model and included as fixed effects: herd x <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> class of age, and month x year. Random effects were herd x year of calving, permanent environmental, additive genetic, and residual effects. The fatty acid contents were estimated by mid-infrared spectrometry. Delta- 9 activity varied within year and lactation. The obtained heritability estimates of delta- 9 as well as the genetic and phenotypic correlation varied also through lactation. This study suggests potential improvements of delta- 9 activity and subsequently milk fat composition can be achieved by animal management but also by breeding and animal selection.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess changes in the {{anaerobic}} threshold of young soccer players in an annual training cycle. A group of highly trained 15 - 18 year old players of KKS Lech Poznań were tested. The tests included an annual training macrocycle, and its individual stages resulted from the time structure of the sports training. In order to assess the level of exercise capacities of the players, a field exercise <b>test</b> <b>of</b> increasing intensity was carried out on a soccer pitch. The test made it possible to determine the 4 millimolar lactate threshold (T LA 4 mmol[*]·[*]l- 1) on the basis of the lactate concentration in blood [LA], to establish the threshold running speed and the threshold heart rate [HR]. The threshold running speed at the level of the 4 millimolar lactate threshold was established using the two-point form of the equation of a straight line. The obtained indicators of the threshold running speed allowed for precise establishment of effort intensity used in individual training in developing aerobic endurance. In order to <b>test</b> the significance <b>of</b> differences in mean values between four <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> a non-parametric Friedman ANOVA test was used. The significance of differences between consecutive <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> was determined using a post-hoc Friedman ANOVA test. The tests showed significant differences in values of selected indicators determined at the anaerobic threshold in various stages of an annual training cycle of young soccer players. The most beneficial changes in terms of the threshold running speed were noted on the fourth <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> when the participants had the highest values of 4. 01 m[*]·[*]s- 1 for older juniors, and 3. 80 m[*]·[*]s- 1 for younger juniors.

Different natural sources of variation such as feeding or genetics could be used to modify the contents of unsaturated fatty acids. The impact of feeding is well described; however, genetics effects on the milk FA composition are not well studied. Increasing the unsaturated fatty acids contents of bovine milk could have the potential to raise the nutritive and therapeutic values of dairy products. The stearoyl Coenzyme-A desaturase 9 (delta- 9) gene was identified as a potential functional candidate gene affecting milk fat composition in dairy cattle. The objective of this research was to study the genetic variability on this enzyme activity across lactations. A total of 199, 977 test-day records were obtained from 29, 603 Holstein cows in first lactation, 154, 267 records from 23, 453 Holstein cows in second lactation, and 173, 244 records from 75, 887 Holstein cows in third and later lactations. The used model was a multiple-trait random regressions test-day model. Fixed effects were: herd × <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> and class of age. Random effects were: herd × year of calving, permanent environmental, additive genetic, and residual effects. The studied traits were milk yield, protein content, percentage of fat, monounsaturated fatty acids estimated by mid-infrared spectrometry, and the ratios reflecting the delta- 9 activity. Obtained heritability estimates of delta- 9 as well as the genetic and phenotypic correlations varied across lactations.

40|$|Frequent {{measurements}} of skid resistance {{were made on}} 20 pavements in common use in Kentucky. Tests were conducted from November 1969 through 1973. Principal analysis involved relating changes in skid resistance to {{day of the year}} and relating skid resistance to temperature at the time of test, to average antecedent temperatures, and to average rainfall. Seasonal variations exhibited an annual sinusoidal cycle. The changes in sand-asphalt and bituminous concrete surfaces under higher volumes of traffic were about 12 skid numbers. The changes in portland cement concrete and bituminous concrete under lower volumes of traffic were about 5 skid numbers. The lowest skid numbers (SN's) occurred in early to mid-August for portland cement concrete and sand-asphalt pavements and in late August to early September for bituminous concrete. Correlations between changes in SN and temperature were best for ambient air temperature averaged over 4 - and 8 -week periods prior to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test.</b> However, correlations between changes in SN and temperature were not as good as correlations between SN and day of the year. On the other hand, combining traffic volumes in the form of deviations from yearly average daily traffic with temperature yielded correlations with SN's which were as good as correlations between SN's and the day of the year. It was concluded that skid resistance measurements in Kentucky should be conducted between the first of July and the middle of November to be assured of detecting significant differences in SN. However, frequent testing of reference sections is recommended to define more specifically each year the beginning and ending date of the testing season. Burchett and Rizenberg...|$|E
40|$|A particularity of the Luxembourg milk {{recording}} {{is the use}} of different schemes. Two principal schemes are applied: the scheme “S” applied on 69. 1 % of the total herds (n= 712) and consisting in one proportionate sample of all daily milkings, and the scheme “T” (21. 6 % of the total herds) which consists in one sample of only one milking (morning or evening milking) (and alternating milking time from month to month). The problematic is that application of different schemes could influence the milk components (protein and fat yield) and the milk fat components (saturated and unsaturated groups of fatty acids) genetic parameters estimation and to prevent all comparisons between dairy population under different {{milk recording}} schemes. A total of 47, 613 and 44, 833 test-day records were obtained, respectively for schemes “S” and “T” from Holstein cows in first lactation in Luxembourg dairy herds. The used model included as fixed effects: herd x <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> class of age, and month x year. Random effects were permanent environmental, additive genetics, and residual effects. The main objective of this work is to study the effect the choice of milk recording schemes (“S” or “T” schemes) on milk yield and milk components genetic parameters. A solution could be to add a fixed effect taking in account the milking time. The second objective is to study the effect of milking time (morning or evening) on genetic parameters estimated in the case of scheme “T”. According to the results, genetic parameters were statistically different between the schemes “S” and “T” for milk yield (P value < 0. 0001). Further, the classifications of bulls according to their breeding values were very different when values were estimated on basis of scheme “S” or “T” (Spearman correlation value of 0. 51 for milk yield for example). In conclusion, using several milk recording schemes do not allow any comparison of genetic parameters between dairy cattle’s. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{describes}} {{exposures to}} military veterans who participated between 1941 and 1989 in British research at Porton Down {{on the effects}} of exposure to chemical warfare agents and to defences against those agents. The study is part of a programme of epidemiological research initiated in response to service veterans' concerns about possible long-term health effects of their participation. Methods: All entries in 97 books held in the Porton Down historical experimental archive covering the years 1939 – 1989 were reviewed. For tests between April 1941 and December 1989, data were abstracted on chemicals used, with additional detail abstracted for tests involving vesicants and nerve agents. For tests recorded during 1939 – 1941, similar data were abstracted for a representative sample of tests. Results: Historical data were abstracted for 17 303 veterans included in the cohort study of 18 276 servicemen who took part in tests at Porton Down between 1941 and 1989. The median number of days per veteran on which tests were carried out was 2 days. The median difference between the last and first day of testing was 4 days. A large number of chemicals were tested over this period (n = 492). The type of chemical tested varied over time. Exposures were often modified by respirator use or use of protective clothing or protective equipment. It was possible to assign a quantitative measure of cumulative exposure to 73 % of veterans exposed to the vesicant sulphur mustard— 3491 (34 %) of exposed veterans had cumulative exposures ≥ 10. 63 mg and for 70 % of veterans exposed to the nerve agent sarin— 658 (29 %) of exposed veterans had cumulative exposures ≥ 15. 0 mg min m− 3. Ninety-three per cent of veterans exposed to sulphur mustard were classified to a semi-quantitative scale of dermal effect— 3771 (37 %) had a vesicle or necrosed area, and 69 % of veterans exposed to sarin could be categorized by change in blood cholinesterase activity— 1033 (31 %) had a depression in cholinesterase activity of ≥ 30 %. Conclusions: The experimental archive at Porton Down {{has proved to be a}} rich source of data on tests conducted between 1941 and 1989. It has been possible to categorize most veterans according to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> chemical group, chemical, type of protection and, for certain chemicals, level of exposure and/or degree of acute toxicity.

40|$|Serum {{prostate}} specific antigen (PSA) test {{is commonly}} used {{as a tool for}} screening and early detection of prostate cancer. Many factors can affect its sensitivity and specificity as a screening test of prostate cancer. Its efficacy has been much debated ever since its introduction for this purpose. There is a need to better understand the confounding factors, among them seasonal variation in serum PSA levels, {{in order to make the}} best use of this test. By understanding the normal seasonal variation in serum PSA in a specific population, the cutoff point for normality may need to be adjusted according to the time of the year in order to maintain the efficacy of PSA test as a tool for screening early prostate cancer. The aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence of seasonal variations of serum PSA levels and the effects they might exert on the usage of PSA for prostate cancer screening in Hong Kong. Total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) data were collected from two major laboratories in Hong Kong. In order to safeguard patient confidentiality, no personal identifying information was collected. Data collected were <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> sample collection, client age, tPSA and fPSA levels, PSA measurement method and clinical history of prostate cancer, if available. Three meteorological parameters, namely daily mean air temperature, total bright sunshine duration, and global solar radiation, covering the test sample collection period, were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory official web site. A total of 15, 863 tPSA and 491 fPSA test results from 31 st Oct 2005 to 31 st Dec 2007 were collected. The age of clients has a mean of 58. 4 year and ranges from 13 to 102 year. The tPSA and fPSA values were correlated with moving averages of the meteorological parameters. Although the results varied somewhat between the two laboratories, overall the tPSA results were significantly correlated with the three meteorological parameters. The strongest correlation was with daily mean air temperature. No correlation was shown between the meteorological parameters with either fPSA or percent fPSA (%fPSA). tPSA tests performed during summer periods were more likely to have a value of > 4 ng/mL (chi-square test, p < 0. 001), which is the range of test results for which prostate biopsies would be recommended. It was estimated that there would be at least a 16 % increase in abnormal tPSA values for tests performed between summers should these tests be ordered during the summer months instead. The study found no variations of fPSA and %fPSA with seasonal change. In conclusion, due to seasonal variations and other factors that may affect serum PSA levels, a single abnormal tPSA result should be interpreted with caution. A marginally elevated tPSA value, especially when obtained during summer time, should be repeated and confirmed before biopsies are recommended...|$|E

The study was carried out on five dates in key moments of the time frame of the annual training cycle (the beginning and the end of the basic preparatory period, the end of the spring round of the starting period and the beginning and the end of the autumn round of the starting period). In order to establish the level of aerobic performance the subjects performed an exercise test with increasing intensity on a Woodway treadmill with a 5 % elevation. The initial speed of the treadmill belt was 8 km•h- 1 and was increased every three minutes by 2 km•h- 1 until exhaustion. During the exercise test the following physiological indicators were recorded on an ongoing basis using the Cardio Pulmonary Exercise computer system (Medical Graphics Corporation, USA) : •VO 2, •VO 2 •kg- 1, VE, •VO 2 •HR- 1, RQ, as well as the running speed (V) and the distance covered.
