5000|$|A {{problem with}} the TRF {{receiver}} built with triode vacuum tubes was the triode's <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> allowed energy in the output circuit to feedback into the input. That feedback could cause instability and oscillation that would frustrate reception and produce squealing or howling noises in the speaker. In 1922, Louis Alan Hazeltine invented the technique of neutralization that uses additional circuitry to partially cancel {{the effect of the}} <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Neutralization was used in the popular Neutrodyne series of TRF receivers. Under certain conditions, [...] "the neutralization is substantially independent of frequency over a wide frequency band." [...] "Perfect neutralization cannot be maintained in practice over a wide band of frequencies because leakage inductances and stray capacities" [...] are not completely canceled. [...] The later development of the tetrode and pentode vacuum tubes minimized the effect of interelectrode capacitances and could make neutralization unnecessary; the additional electrodes in those tubes shield the plate and grid and minimize feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum tube {{feedback}} oscillators {{became the}} basis of radio transmission by 1920. However, the triode vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300 MHz because of <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance.</b> To reach higher frequencies, new [...] "transit time" [...] (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in [...] "bunches" [...] through the tube. The first of these was the Barkhausen-Kurz oscillator (1920), the first tube to produce power in the UHF range. The most important and widely used were the klystron (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity magnetron (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).|$|E
50|$|This scheme {{inherently}} introduces dynamic, even harmonic distortion. As {{the input}} signal becomes more positive, cathode current increases, increasing bias and reducing gain. As the input signal becomes more negative, cathode current decreases, decreasing bias and increasing gain. The {{result is a}} plate signal with positive excursions greater than the negative input and negative excursions smaller than the positive input. It must be borne {{in mind that the}} input and output signals are ideally exactly out of phase. Since cathode bias is normally employed at audio or very low radio frequencies, issues such as transit time and <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> may be disregarded and the ideal assumed.|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe usual {{modeling}} of power MOSFET and IGBT <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitances</b> {{is based on}} a single dipolar representation of the electric charge induced in the intercellular drain region. In this article, it is proved by some experimental tests that this representation, symbolised by the gate transfer capacitance CGD, is not physics-based. Then, it is demonstrated that <b>interelectrode</b> MOS <b>capacitances</b> are tripolar couplings. A physical capacitive model is detailed, implemented in a simulation software, and compared with experiment...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{types of}} {{parasitic}} oscillation {{are caused by}} small <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitances</b> (parasitic capacitance) or mutual inductance between adjacent wires or electronic components on the circuit board, which create an inadvertent feedback path. However these usually cause oscillations of high frequency, at {{the upper end of}} or above the passband of the equipment. This is because the phase shift of the small reactances in the feedback path, which increases with frequency, only become significant at high frequencies. Low frequency oscillations like motorboating indicate that some device or circuit with a large time constant is involved, such as the interstage coupling capacitors [...] or transformers, or the filter capacitors and supply transformer winding.|$|R
5000|$|The type 955 triode [...] "acorn tube" [...] {{is a small}} triode {{thermionic}} valve (vacuum tube in USA) designed primarily to operate at high frequency; although data books specify an upper limit of 400-600 MHz, some circuits may obtain gain up to about 900 MHz. <b>Interelectrode</b> <b>capacitances</b> and Miller capacitances are minimized by the small dimensions of the device and the widely separated pins. The connecting pins are placed around {{the periphery of the}} bulb and project radially outward: this maintains short internal leads with low inductance, an important property allowing operation at high frequency. The pins fit a special socket fabricated as a ceramic ring in which the valve itself occupies the central space.|$|R
50|$|The valve <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> which {{exists between}} the input and output of the {{amplifier}} and other stray coupling may allow enough energy to feed back into input so as to cause self oscillation in an amplifier stage. For the higher gain designs this effect must be counteracted. Various methods exist for introducing an out of phase signal from the output back to the input so that the effect is cancelled. Even when the feed back {{is not sufficient to}} cause oscillation it can produce other effects, such as difficult tuning. Therefore, neutralization can be helpful, even for an amplifier that does not oscillate. Many grounded grid amplifiers use no neutralization, but at 30 MHz adding it can smooth out the tuning.|$|E
5000|$|The circuit was {{developed}} about 1922 by Harold Wheeler {{who worked in}} Louis Hazeltine's laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology, so Hazeltine is usually given the credit. [...] The tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, {{one of the most}} popular radio receiver designs of the time, consisted of several tuned radio frequency (RF) amplifier stages, followed by a detector and several audio amplifier stages. A major defect of the TRF receiver was that, due to the high <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> of early triode vacuum tubes, feedback within the RF amplifier stages gave them a tendency to oscillate, creating unwanted radio frequency alternating currents. These parasitic oscillations mixed with the carrier wave in the detector, creating heterodynes (beat notes) in the audio frequency range, which were heard as annoying whistles and howls from the speaker.|$|E
5000|$|A type of {{low power}} triode for use at high (UHF) frequencies, the [...] "lighthouse" [...] tube has a planar {{construction}} to reduce <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> and lead inductance, which gives it {{the appearance of}} a [...] "lighthouse". The disk-shaped cathode, grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube - a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers. The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube's pins, but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube: the grid to a metal ring halfway up, and the plate to a metal button at the top. These are one example of [...] "disk seal" [...] design. Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections, including heater and D.C. cathode.|$|E
40|$|A vacuum phototriodes (VPT) are the photodetectors {{used in the}} endcaps of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid {{experiment}} at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

The simulation also confirmed the need for a fine mesh anode to achieve a useful gain when operating at high magnetic fields. The experimental work represents the first measurements of the time response of a VPT when excited with a very fast light pulse.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a novel {{method for}} the analysis of MOSFET commutations and the investigation of related losses and spike current issues in the switching power converter (SPC) design. The synchronous rectification switching cell (SRSC) configuration is considered for the investigation, which is used in the high-frequency high-efficiency (H 2 EF) SPC design. The proposed method is aimed at providing an effective tool for quick feasibility investigations and comparative evaluations among design solutions using different MOSFET combinations for the design of H 2 EF SPCs. The method allows us to use nonlinear models of <b>interelectrode</b> MOSFET <b>capacitances</b> and adopts a novel numerical technique specifically developed to solve the SRSC model ensuring robust and fast simulations. Capacitive pulsating currents circulating through the MOSFETs and the SPC during commutations can be analyzed in detail by using the proposed method. Different examples are discussed to show how MOSFETs characteristics and operating conditions may affect switching losses, because of the pulsing currents circulation through the SPC...|$|R

The measured coefficient depends on which charge is sampled, that of the excited electrode or that of the other one. The analysis of the data at large distances is in agreement with the asymptotic formulas for the capacitance coefficients.

40|$|In the {{measurement}} of small capacitances, such as the <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> of vacuum tubes, standards are needed for checking the calibration of the measuring equipment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{properties}} of linear active coupled lines consisting of electrically long GaAs MESFET structures are investigated for possible applications as traveling-wave broad-band amplifiers. In addition, the nonlinear coupled Schottky lines are studied for applications as voltage tunable circuit elements. The {{analysis of the}} general active asymmetric coupled transmission lines in an inhomogeneous medium is presented. The scattering parameters of a four-port network based on the general normal mode analysis of coupled lines are derived {{in terms of the}} equivalent circuit elements associated with the long MESFET structure. These are then used to study the {{properties of}} the four-port device for applications as traveling-wave amplifiers. One of the objectives {{of this study is to}} model the device by calculating the electrical parameters of the structure from its physical (geometrical and material) parameters. An accurate computer program based on up to date theoretical formulas and experimental results for calculating these circuit elements is developed. A method based on the conformal mapping is developed to calculate the exact values of <b>interelectrode</b> <b>capacitances</b> for the two and three asymmetric coplanar strips. Empirical closed-form expressions are also obtained for these capacitances by using simple curve fitting procedures. In order to help optimize the performance of the device in terms of its gain and bandwidth, a CAD program "TOUCHSTONE" is used. Various techniques to compensate for the difference in the capacitive and inductive loading of the gate and drain lines and to synchronize the phase velocity of the waves on both lines are investigated. It is found that a distributed inductance has to be added to the drain line to equalize the velocities and optimize the device's performance, i. e., the gain-bandwidth product. The termination impedances are also optimized. Typical devices with the optimized termination impedances and synchronized phase velocities give more than 3 dB power gain for frequencies up to 34 GHz. The dependence of the Schottky junction capacitance under the gate on the applied voltage gives rise to the nonlinear behavior in the transmission lines. The coupled Schottky lines are analyzed by using a linearized and a nonlinear quasi-harmonic model. It is shown that such structures can be used as voltage tunable devices including directional couplers and electronic switches consisting of a long dual-gate type coplanar structure. Examples of voltage tunable couplers and a 15 GHz switch are included...|$|R
40|$|Entirely {{satisfactory}} {{treatment of}} complete heart block has been prevented by {{an inability to}} measure pacemaker function after implantation. Two major problems can be identified in the long-term management of pacemaker patients: first, adequate prediction of when a pacemaker will fail; and second, accurate diagnosis {{of the type of}} pacemaker failure if it occurs. Observations on dogs gave precise measurements of interelectrode impedances. A method is described of externally measuring the <b>interelectrode</b> resistance and <b>capacitance</b> of implanted pacemakers. In studies on both dogs and human beings it was found that all changes in interelectrode impedance could be identified by changes in pacemaker rate and pulse width. Serial measurements of these two parameters allowed accurate diagnosis of the different types of "pacemaker failures. " The method also enabled anticipation of failures, other than wire breakage, before they were clinically evident. We think that pacemaker performance can be adequately evaluated by this method, making unnecessary prophylactic replacement of the unit...|$|R
40|$|Impedance {{measurements}} {{are necessary to}} determine the passive electrical properties of cells including the equivalent circuits of the several pathways for current flow. Such {{measurements are}} usually made with microelectrodes of high impedance (some 15 MΩ) over a wide frequency range (1 - 10, 000 Hz) and so are subject to many errors. An input amplifier has been developed which has negligible phase shift in this frequency range because it uses negative feedback to keep tiny the voltage {{on top of the}} microelectrode. An important source of artifact is the extracellular potential produced by capacitive current flow through the wall of the microelectrodes and the effective resistance of the bathing solution. This artifact is reduced some 10 times by shielding the current microelectrode with a conductive paint. The residual artifact is analyzed, measured, and subtracted from our results. The <b>interelectrode</b> coupling <b>capacitance</b> is reduced below 2 × 10 - 17 F and can be neglected. Phase and amplitude measurements are made with phase-sensitive detectors insensitive to noise. The entire apparatus is calibrated at different signal to noise ratios {{and the nature of the}} extracellular potential is investigated. The phase shift in the last 5 - 20 μm of the microelectrode tip is shown to be small and quite independent of frequency under several conditions. Experimental measurements of the phase characteristic of muscle fibers in normal Ringer are presented. The improvements in apparatus and the physiological significance of impedance measurements are discussed. It is suggested that the interpretation of impedance measurements is sensitive to small errors and so it is necessary to present objective evidence of the reliability of one's apparatus and measurements...|$|R
