Electric vehicles (EVs) are clean, quiet and efficient and offer a great opportunity to keep our environment healthy.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Nature via the DOI in this record. Enteroviruses (EVs) are common RNA viruses that cause diseases ranging from rash to paralytic poliomyelitis. For example, EV-A and EV-C viruses cause hand-foot and mouth disease and EV-B viruses cause encephalitis and myocarditis, which can result in severe morbidity and mortality. While new vaccines and treatments for EVs are under development, methods for studying and diagnosing EV infections are still limited and therefore new diagnostic tools are required. Our aim was to produce and characterize new antibodies that work in multiple applications and detect EVs in tissues and in vitro. Rats were immunized with Coxsackievirus B 1 capsid protein VP 1 and hybridomas were produced. Hybridoma clones were selected based on their reactivity in different immunoassays. The most promising clone, 3 A 6, was characterized and it performed well in multiple techniques including ELISA, immunoelectron microscopy, immunocyto- and histochemistry and in Western blotting, detecting EVs in infected cells and tissues. It recognized several EV-Bs and also the EV-C representative Poliovirus 3, making it a broad-spectrum <b>EV</b> <b>specific</b> antibody. The 3 A 6 rat monoclonal antibody can help to overcome some of the challenges faced with commonly used EV antibodies: it enables simultaneous use of mouse-derived antibodies in double staining and it is useful in murine models.

40|$|New {{challenges}} arise for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) engineers when {{electric motors}} are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). The noise signature from an electric traction motor {{is characterized by}} speed-dependent high frequency tonal components due to electro-magnetic excitation. Despite the relatively low overall levels, those tonal components can be prominent and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. With the rapid increase of various types of hybrid/electric vehicles (EV), new methods are required to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The objective of this thesis was to explore the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate experimental methods for assessment of noise transmission. The thesis is based upon seven papers. Four of the papers are oriented around tools and techniques for sound quality assessments of EV-noise. Due to the specific character, there is a proven need for engineers to identify relevant psycho-acoustic metrics for quantifying the subjective perceptions of an accelerating EV. The relationship between the metric prominence ratio (PR) and perceived annoyance was explored and requirement criteria were proposed. PR is appropriate for quantifying individual tonal components, well frequency separated from each other. For more complex sounds, e. g. with multiple proximate prominent tones, the suitability of this metric is questioned. Therefore, the harmonic content {{of a large number}} of EVs on the market was examined in order to bring further facts to the on-going discussion on sound quality quantification of <b>EV</b> <b>specific</b> noise. Furthermore, the assessment environment’s role as well as the impact of experiencing the sound sensation in the real environment for sound quality evaluations were studied. Finally, perception of the tonal components related to different DC/AC conversion techniques including randomized pulse-width modulation was explored. The main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise were studied. The acoustic transfer functions’ (ATF) spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise was investigated for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. ATFs and surface velocities are also central for the presented in-situ method for determination of radiated sound power from the stator housing due to a dominant order. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for estimation of the radiation efficiency was derived. The two papers highlight the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power to be used as an acoustic source characterization, which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers. The final contribution of methods for handling EV-specific noise concerns structure-borne sound. The method of in-situ estimation of blocked forces, a theoretically independent source characterization, is evaluated for transfer path analysis (TPA) of a double isolated electric rear axle drive. The method has two main advantages; it is substantially faster compared to the conventional TPA method and the blocked forces allow for accurate prediction of the acoustic response when the same source is being integrated with a different receiving structure. The prerequisite for the second is that the source activity remains invariant and this was further studied. In summary, the work reported in this thesis is intended to support engineers to succeed with the acoustic refinement and thereby also to contribute to increasing competitiveness of hybrid/electric vehicles.

EVs isolated based on immunoaffinity have different characteristics than those isolated based on size. Size-based separation cannot distinguish among subpopulations of EVs. For example, {{if the goal is}} to distinguish the CD 81 + subpopulation of EVs from the CD 63 + subpopulation, immunoaffinity is recommended [64]. Many studies have discovered EV biogenesis and subpopulations by exploiting the interaction of surface proteins with specific antibodies. Tetraspanin-specific antibodies are common in immunoaffinity [65]; for example, CD 81 is internalized more slowly than CD 9 [66]. ELISA with anti-CD 81 antibody has been used to quantify EGFR level in plasma EVs from lung cancer patients.

Methods: Polyprotein sequences of all four dengue serotypes were collected and aligned using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment plugin with Geneious Pro v 6. 1. Consensus sequences of the polyproteins for all four dengue serotypes were designed and screened against experimentally proven epitopes to predict potential antigenic regions that are conserved among all four dengue serotypes.

This thesis explores the potential of two surface-based sensor methods, namely surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) and optical waveguide scattering / fluorescence microscopy (OWSFM), for physical characterization of <b>EVs.</b> <b>EVs</b> carrying <b>specific</b> exosomal marker were quantified in terms of bulk concentration using SPR. A key uncertainty of this quantification approach was suggested to originate from vesicles contraction upon adsorption to the sensor surface. This concern was scrutinized with dual-wavelength SPR, illustrating the advantage of dual-wavelength SPR over conventional SPR to quantify nanoparticle contraction in general and concentration determination of EVs in particular. As an extension of these findings, OWSFM was utilized to compare the optical density and lipid content of two sub-populations of extracellular vesicles observed at the single particle level in both scattering and fluorescence mode. In summary, the thesis work contributes with new tools for improved characterization of physicochemical properties of different EVs and concentration determinations of sub-population of EVs carrying exosomal markers...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular vesicles (EVs), {{including}} microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes, {{are small}} vesicles secreted {{from a wide}} variety of cells. Whereas MVs are particles released by the outward budding of the plasma membrane, exosomes are derived from endocytic compartments. Secretion of EVs can be enhanced by specific stimuli, and increased plasma circulating levels of EVs have been correlated with pathophysiological situations. MVs, already present in the blood of healthy individuals, are considerably elevated in several cardiovascular diseases associated with inflammation, suggesting that they can mediate deleterious effects such as endothelial dysfunction or thrombosis. Nonetheless, very recent studies also demonstrate that MVs may act as biological information vectors transferring proteins or genetic material to maintain cell homeostasis, favor cell repair or even promote angiogenesis. Additionally, exosomes have also been shown to have proangiogenic and cardioprotective properties. These beneficial effects therefore reveal the potential therapeutical use of EVs in the field of cardiovascular medicine and regenerative therapy. In this review, we will provide an update of cellular processes modulated by <b>EVs</b> of <b>specific</b> interest in the treatment of cardiovascular pathologies. A special focus will be made on the morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh) associated with EVs (EVsShh+), which have been shown to mediate many pro-angiogenic effects. In addition to offer a potential source of cardiovascular markers, therapeutical potential of EVs reveal exciting opportunities to deliver specific agents by non-immunogenic means to cardiovascular system...|$|R
40|$|The UK–Russia {{extracellular}} vesicles (EVs) workshop {{was held}} at the Medical Center of the M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, with 56 attendees from UK and Russian universities and research institutes. The program consisted of 6 research sessions and was focused on studies of EVs isolated from in vitro model systems or biological fluids, including blood and urine. The multidisciplinary program included presentations on mechanisms of EV biogenesis, the role of EVs in disease pathogenesis, the diagnostic value of EVs, including their quantitation and cargo load, as well as the clinical use of EVs in regenerative medicine. Methodological challenges imposed by the nanoscale size of EVs as well as targeted delivery approaches for therapeutics were considered in a separate session on technologies. The main aim of the workshop was to overview challenges confronting EV researchers and to facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers with different backgrounds and skills. Given the lack of definitive <b>EV</b> nomenclature, <b>specific</b> terms (exosomes or microvesicles) were only applied in the meeting report to studies that carried out full EV characterization, including differential ultracentrifugation isolation approaches, comprehensive protein marker characterization, and single vesicle analysis (electron microscopy and nanoparticle analysis), to ascertain EV size and morphology following the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles standardization recommendations (1, 2). In studies where characterization was not conclusive, the term EV is used...|$|R
40|$|The {{arrival of}} the {{electric}} vehicle (EV) on the market is one consequence of government measures to improve air quality and reduce CO 2 emissions. However, the <b>EV</b> has <b>specific</b> properties of use associated with its limited range and relative silence compared to normal vehicles, influencing the mobility behaviours of drivers and requiring them to develop some new driving abilities. This paper examines the behavioural modifications brought about by daily use of an electric vehicle at three different levels of driving activity: strategic, tactical and operational. The study collected and analyzed the self-reported behaviours (via questionnaires and travels dairies) of 36 Parisian private drivers, each of whom drove for six months an electric MINI E prototype. The {{results of the study}} show that driving an EV requires a learning phase to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to operate the vehicle. At the strategic level of driving, drivers take into account the restricted range of the EV, implement a daily charge process, and develop new behaviours related to trip planning. The study also examines driver behaviour at the tactical level, in terms of driver interactions with other road users to deal with the silent nature of the EV, and at the operational level of driving, in terms of braking behaviour to master the regenerative braking function of the EV. The paper discusses the interactions between these three levels of driving activity...|$|R
