40|$|Two {{standard}} {{techniques are}} used for the clinical examination of abnormal swallowing: Videofluoroscopy which depends on irradiation, and Cervical Auscultation, which makes use of a stethoscope. Both of these techniques have important disadvantages. The first does not lend itself to routine use and the second provides no reliable quantitative information. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} utility of some of the methods used in Speech and Hearing Sciences. These methods do not use radiation and have the potential to give more accurate timing information than can be derived from auditory/acoustic monitoring. Pilot data were obtained from the simultaneous use of four sensors: an <b>ear-plug</b> microphone of the type used successfully for the detection of otoacoustic emissions; a standard miniature electret microphone ordinarily used for speech recording; a miniature accelerometer of the type sometimes used for monitoring nasality; and a standard electrolaryngograph. Swallow measurements were made with twenty normal adult subjects. The most effective single signal was that provided by the use of standard electrolaryngograp...|$|E
40|$|EarFieldSensing (EarFS) {{is a novel}} {{input method}} for mobile and {{wearable}} computing using facial expressions. Facial muscle movements induce both electric field changes and physical deformations, which are detectable with electrodes placed inside the ear canal. The chosen <b>ear-plug</b> form factor is rather unobtrusive and allows for facial gesture recognition while utilizing the {{close proximity to the}} face. We collected 25 facial-related gestures and used them to compare the performance levels of several electric sensing technologies (EMG, CS, EFS, EarFS) with varying electrode setups. Our developed wearable fine-tuned electric field sensing employs differential amplification to effectively cancel out environmental noise while still being sensitive towards small facial-movement-related electric field changes and artifacts from ear canal deformations. By comparing a mobile with a stationary scenario, we found that EarFS continues to perform better in a mobile scenario. Quantitative results show EarFS to be capable of detecting a set of 5 facial gestures with a precision of 90 % while sitting and 85. 2 % while walking. We provide detailed instructions to enable replication of our low-cost sensing device. Applying it to different positions of our body will also allow to sense a variety of other gestures and activities...|$|E

The silver {{handicraft}} in Koto Gadang district have been well-known since long time ago.   The things made by each handycraft centers are almost the same {{so that it is}} difficult to create interesting shapes for consumers. Beside that, the technique used is still a simple one, and the motives applied to the handicraft are only little developed. Therefore, this research tries to describe several things:   1) To identify silver handicraft product shapes; 2) To identify the name of the motives being developed; 3) To explain the production technique of silver handicraft. This research is conducted in Koto  Gadang; using quantitative  and  qualitative  sampling.

40|$|There are two {{objective}} test methods {{for measuring the}} sound attenuation characteristics of hearing protectors. One of them makes use of artificial heads (e. g. the acoustic test fixture (ATF) of ISO TR 4869 - 3 or a commercially available head and torso simulator (HATS)), the other one uses miniature microphones in the ear canals of real ears (MIRE technique). Both methods work quite well with ear-muffs, but their application to <b>ear-plugs</b> gives rise to severe problems. The standardised ATF has no ear canal simulation and therefore {{it is not at}} all suitable for <b>ear-plugs.</b> The ear canal simulations of commercially available HATSs were not yet good enough to produce correct data for <b>ear-plugs.</b> The MIRE technique can be easily applied to only very few types of <b>ear-plugs</b> (e. g. those with an existing (closed) bore that be used to measure the second at the eardrum side of the plug as for example with some otoplastic type <b>ear-plugs</b> or with the EAR-Link type). With all other types of <b>ear-plugs</b> difficulties arise because either the behaviour of the device is changed by attaching the miniature microphone, or the tightness of the fit is decreased by microphone cables along the side of the plug. However, there is an urgent need for an {{objective test}} method for <b>ear-plugs,</b> e. g. for measuring the sound attenuation in impulsive noise, for production control, for pattern evaluation or for designing new types of <b>ear-plugs.</b> Recently, new ear canal simulations of two commercially available HATSs have become available: Brueel and Kjaer 4128 with pinna simulators DZ 9751 / 9752 and HEAD-acoustics HMS II. 4 n.

40|$|Bone {{conduction}} {{sound transmission}} {{in the human}} skull and the occlusion effect were estimated from hearing thresholds and ear-canal sound pressure (ECSP) measured by a probe tube microphone when stimulation was at three positions on the skull (ipsilateral mastoid, contralateral mastoid, and forehead). The measurements were done with the ear-canal open as well as occluded by an <b>ear-plug.</b> Depending on the estimation method, transcranial transmission at frequencies below 1  kHz was between − 8 and 5  dB, around 0  dB at 1  kHz that decreased with frequency to between − 17 and − 7  dB at 8  kHz. The forehead transmission was, except at frequencies between 1 and 2  kHz, similar to that proposed in the standard ISO: 389 - 3 (1994) when the threshold measurements were conducted with open ear-canals. Compared with the same measurements using hearing thresholds, the ECSP gave similar transmission results at most frequencies, but differed at 0. 5, 0. 75, 2 and 3  kHz. One probable reason for the differences between thresholds and ECSP might be a significant perception improvement (lower thresholds) when the stimulation was at the ipsilateral mastoid that was not found at the other positions. This improvement, which also was present in the occlusion effect data, was hypothesized to originate in greater sensitivity of the cochlea for vibration {{in line with the}} ipsilateral stimulation direction than from other directions...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at the {{advancement}} of state-of-art accelerometer design and optimization methodology by developing an <b>ear-plug</b> accelerometer for race car drivers based on a novel mechanical principle. The accelerometer {{is used for the}} measurements of head acceleration when an injurious event occurs. Main requirements for such sensor are miniaturization (2 × 2 mm), because the device must be placed into the driver earpiece, and its measurement accuracy (i. e. high sensitivity, low crosstalk and low nonlinearity) since the device is used for safety monitoring purpose. A micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) -based (bulk micromachined) piezoresistive accelerometer was selected as enabling technology {{for the development of the}} sensor. The primary accelerometer elements that can be manipulated during the design stage are: the sensing element (piezoresistors), the micromechanical structure and the measurements circuit. Each of these elements has been specifically designed in order to maximize the sensor performance and to achieve the miniaturization required for the studied application. To achieve accelerometer high sensitivity and miniaturization silicon nanowires (SiNWs) as nanometer scale piezoresistors are adopted as sensing elements. Currently this technology is at an infancy stage, but very promising through the exploitation of the “Giant piezoresistance effect” of SiNWs. This work then measures the potential of the SiNWs as nanoscale piezoresistors by calculating the major performance indexes, both electrical and mechanical, of the novel accelerometer. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of nanoscale piezoresistors boosts the sensitivity by 30 times in comparison to conventional microscale piezoresistors. A feasibility study on nanowires fabrication by both top-down and bottom-up approaches is also carried out. The micromechanical structure used for the design of the accelerometer is an optimized highly symmetric geometry chosen for its self-cancelling property. This work, for the first time, presents an optimization process of the accelerometer micromechanical structure based on a novel mechanical principle, which simultaneously increases the sensitivity and reduces the cross-sensitivity progressively. In the open literature among highly symmetric geometries no other study has to date reported enhancement of the electrical sensitivity and reduction of the cross-talk at the same time. Moreover the novel mechanical principle represents advancement in the accelerometer design and optimization methodology by studying the influence of a uniform mass moment of inertia of the accelerometer proof mass on the sensor performance. Finally, an optimal accelerometer design is proposed and an optimized measurement circuit is also specifically designed to maximize the performance of the accelerometer. The new proposed accelerometer design is capable of increasing the sensor sensitivity of all axes, in particular the Z-axis increases of almost 5 times in respect to the current state-of-art-technology in piezoresistive accelerometer. This occurs thanks to the particular newly developed approach of combination of beams, proof mass geometry and measurement circuit design, together with the use of silicon nanowires as nanoscale piezoresistors. Furthermore the cross-sensitivity is simultaneously minimized for a maximal performance. The sum of the cross-sensitivity of all axes is equal to 0. 4 %, well below the more than 5 % of the state-of-art technology counterpart reported in the literature. Future work is finally outlined and includes the electro-mechanical characterization of the silicon nanowires and the fabrication of the proposed accelerometer prototype that embeds bottom up SiNWs as nanoscale piezoresistors...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of compliance on personal protective equipments among 240 workers in three different divisions involving steel production division, direct reduction iron division and the mechanical division at a steel factory in Terengganu. A series of guided questionnaire were issued to all the workers in the three divisions to measure the prevalence of compliance to five types of personal protective equipments which consist of safety helmet, mask, eye-protective gear, <b>ear-plugs</b> and safety boots. The prevalence compliance to safety helmet, mask, eye protection gear; <b>ear-plugs</b> and safety boots was 67. 1 %, 35. 3 %, 32. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 99. 2 % respectively. There was a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between the compliance to safety helmets with type of work being done and for <b>ear-plugs,</b> relationship with compliance were significantly associated with type of work done, duration of use and fit-testing. Findings of this study also supports the hypothesis that compliance was associated with unimpeded movement, unaffected productivity and unhindered work task (p< 0. 05). Age and tenure in service have no significant relationship with compliance. Knowledge on safety and health issues were shown to relate to compliance with safety helmets (p< 0. 01). It is suggested that the management embark on risk assessment programs to be able to explicitly determine the suitability of personal protective equipment being used in regards to type of work, specifications and comfort of workers. Management should also take a firm stand by developing a policy that supports compliance of personal protective equipments...|$|R

40|$|Conductive hearing loss, {{produced}} by otitis media with effusion, is widespread in young children. However, {{little is known}} about its short- or long-term effects on hearing or the brain. To study the consequences of a conductive loss for the perception and processing of sounds, we plugged the left ear canal of ferrets for 7 - 15 months during either infancy or adulthood. Before or during plugging, the ferrets were trained to perform a binaural task requiring the detection of a 500 Hz tone, positioned 90 degrees to the right, that was masked by two sources of broad-band noise. In one condition ("control"), both noise sources were 90 degrees right and, in the second condition ("bilateral"), one noise source was moved to 90 degrees left. Normal ferrets showed binaural unmasking: tone detection thresholds were lower (mean 10. 1 dB) for the bilateral condition than for the control condition. Both groups of <b>ear-plugged</b> ferrets had reduced unmasking; the mean residual unmasking was 2. 3 dB for the infant and 0. 7 dB for the adult <b>ear-plugged</b> animals. After unplugging, unmasking increased in both groups (infant, 7. 1 dB; adult, 6. 9 dB) but not to normal levels. Repeated testing during the 22 months after unplugging revealed a gradual return to normal levels of unmasking. These results show that a unilateral conductive hearing loss, in either infancy or adulthood, impairs binaural hearing both during and after the hearing loss. They show scant evidence for adaptation to the plug and demonstrate a recovery from the impairment that occurs {{over a period of several}} months after restoration of normal peripheral function...|$|R

50|$|The most {{conspicuous}} {{feature of the}} Botocudos was the tembeitera, a wooden plug or disk which is worn in the lower lip and the lobe of the ear. This disk, made of the specially light and carefully dried wood of the barriguda tree (Chorisia ventricosa), which was called by the natives themselves embur, whence Augustin Saint-Hilaire suggested {{that this could be}} the probable derivation of their name Aimboré (1830). It is worn only in the under-lip, now chiefly by women, but formerly by men also. The operation for preparing the lip begins often as early as the eighth year, when an initial boring is made by a hard pointed stick, and gradually extended by the insertion of larger and larger disks or plugs, sometimes at last as much as 10 cm in diameter. Notwithstanding the lightness of the wood the tembeitera weighs down the lip, which at first sticks out horizontally and at last becomes a mere ring of skin around the wood. <b>Ear-plugs</b> are also worn, of such size as to distend the lobe down to the shoulders. Ear-ornaments of like nature are common in south and even Central America, at least as far north as Honduras, as described by Christopher Columbus when he discovered this latter country during his fourth voyage (1502). This ornament also named part of the Peru seaboard as Costa de la Oreja, from the conspicuously distended ears of the native Chimú. Early Spanish explorers also gave the name Orejones or big-eared to several Amazon tribes.|$|R
40|$|Sound {{perceived}} via Bone Conduction (BC) {{consists of}} vibrations {{transmitted to the}} cochleae through the skull bone from either one's own voice, the surrounding sound field, or a BC transducer. In two-way communication systems, BC is believed to improve the sound quality when used in specific environments, e. g. extremely noisy environments which require hearing protection devices in the ear-canals. Several studies were performed to investigate the possibilities for a BC communication system and to increase the general knowledge of BC sound perception. The difference in sensitivity of the BC and Air Conduction (AC) parts of one's own voice was estimated, showing that the BC component dominated for most sounds between 1 and 2 kHz. Also estimated was the sensitivity difference between BC and AC sound from a surrounding sound field, demonstrating that the BC part was 40 to 60 dB lower than the AC part. A combination of these sensitivity differences provides information about the signal-to-noise improvement by using a BC microphone to record a person's own voice, instead of an ordinary AC microphone {{in front of the}} mouth, in a noisy environment. However, high-frequency losses occur in the signal when recording through the skin. In many of the investigations the occlusion effect was studied by different methods in order to estimate the low-frequency increase in perceived BC sound when wearing <b>ear-plugs</b> and/or ear-muffs. Moreover, the amount of BC sound reaching the cochleae from different positions of the skull bone was examined with the conclusion that relative BC hearing can be estimated from ear-canal sound pressure and cochlear vibrations. Finally, a new transcutaneous Bone Conduction Implant (BCI) hearing aid was investigated. This hearing aid does not require a permanent skin penetration, in contrast to the Bone-Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs) used today. Measurements showed that the new BCI hearing aid can be a realistic alternative to the BAHA...|$|R
