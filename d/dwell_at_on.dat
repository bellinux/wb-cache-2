Their work on “natural proofs ” applies to a large class of arguments that have been used in complexity theory, and shows that no such argument can prove that a problem requires circuits of superpolynomial size, even for some very restricted classes of circuits (under reasonable cryptographic assumptions). This barrier is so daunting, that some researchers have decided to focus their attentions elsewhere. Yet the goal of proving circuit lower bounds is of such importance, that some in the community have proposed concrete strategies for surmounting the obstacle.

In it, they retold {{the history of}} the Legion of the Archangel Michael, a fascist movement these men had been imprisoned for allegedly supporting. They wrote this two-volume memoir as part of their “reeducation” before being released into Romanian society, which was now under communist rule. Unlike most –isms, fascism had no creedal or doctrinal statements that prisoners could recant in order to demonstrate that they had turned their backs on the movement. Instead, they systematically slandered themselves and other former activists, arguing that they had never truly exhibited virtues that legionaries believed had defined fascism in Romania. On the Legionary Movement <b>dwells</b> <b>at</b> length <b>on</b> sexual deviancy, superstition, hypocrisy, betrayal, and violence as key characteristics of Romanian fascism from 1922 until 1964 and praises the brutal prison system as the only way that the social ills of fascism could be remedied...|$|R

The analysis reinstates the fact that chronic poverty in terms of- both severity and long duration- is an overarching reality for almost nine out of ten households in the region.

In what follows I will discuss Elster's contribu-tions to a series of problem areas: the foundations of the theory of rationality, social welfare theory, philosophy of social science, and analytical Marxism. It is impossible to touch on every point of interest, or even a representative sampling; instead I will single out several important areas of controversy for closer inspection.

40|$|Companies {{providing}} {{services in the}} oilfields do not possess suitable equipment maintenance programs, and are not qualified enough to tackle equipment maintenance. Usually, equipment returning from work sites is just washed and painted, and is then ready to take subsequent assignments. Thus, only lip service or facelift service is provided to the equipment as neither specialized inspection nor performance evaluation of its mechanized components are made. Also, no minute observations of their myriads of parts are done. This approach of service providers just show that they want simply {{to shy away from}} the real problems developing with the constant use of equipment, and lack of their maintenance in the real sense. The approach enhances equipment availability, but diminishes equipment durability and reliability.

He was convinced that the heavenly state consisted in complete control of mind over body, especially in the area of sexuality. [...] To illustrate this point, he notes, that some people can wiggle with their ears, nose or even hair, completely at their will. This condition of complete freedom and absence of lust existed for human sexuality too before the fall. The body must be controlled, and therefore Augustine like his teacher Ambrose considered virginity of the human body the superior way of Christ. He considered matrimony a triple blessing in light of its offspring, conjugal faith and being a sacrament: [...] "In conjugal faith it is provided {{that there should be no}} carnal intercourse outside the marriage bond with another man or woman; with regard to offspring, that children should be begotten of love, tenderly cared for and educated in a religious atmosphere; finally, in its sacramental aspect that the marriage bond should not be broken and that a husband or wife, if separated, should not be joined to another even for the sake of offspring. This we regard as the law of marriage by which the fruitfulness of nature is adorned and the evil of incontinence is restrained." ...|$|R

5000|$|Here the Pope <b>dwells</b> <b>at</b> length <b>on</b> {{the concept}} that rights must be linked to duties. Too much focus on one's own rights can lead people to believing they owe nothing to anyone but themselves, to making insistent demands that one's own rights are {{promoted}} by public authorities {{even when they are}} harmful, such as the [...] "right to excess" [...] or to choose vice. This can lead to the whole notion of rights being weakened and even core rights being violated. Benedict argues that core rights are safest when everyone accepts they have a duty to respect other people's development and rights. The Pope turns to duties of governments, which should strive to look after the deep moral needs of their citizens and to promote ethical economic systems where actors look to maximise not just profits but also the common good. The last part of the chapter is about the duty to protect the environment, though the Pope also warns that nature should not be regarded as more important than man. He regrets the way [...] "some states, power groups and companies hoard non-renewable energy resources" [...] which he says [...] "represents a grave obstacle to development in poor countries". Benedict notes the importance for developed countries {{to take the lead in}} reducing their own environmental impact, which may involve in the adoption of new, more environmentally friendly life styles for their populations.|$|R
