25|$|Hamdeen Sabahi, a <b>former</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> in the 2012 presidential election, officially {{announced}} his presidential bid on 8 February 2014. However, the Sabahi campaign has criticized the presidential elections law promulgated by the interim government, deeming its characteristics troubling for the transparency and {{fairness of the}} election. The pro-Sabahi Revolution's Candidate campaign has also expressed reservations {{about the nature of}} the presidential elections law, suggesting that the provision establishing inviolability for the decisions of the Supreme Electoral Committee raises doubts about the integrity of the election process and could potentially force a reassessment of the Sabahi candidacy. On 14 March, Hamdeen Sabahi's presidential campaign announced that Sabahi has decided to continue his candidacy in the presidential election, despite the perceived unconstitutionality of the presidential elections law. Sabahi has taken the medical tests needed to run for presidential office. Sabahi acquired 31,555 endorsements.|$|E
25|$|The {{cornerstone}} laying {{occurred as}} scheduled on November 12. The turnout of about 6,000 people was, however, lighter than expected.

Speakers included <b>former</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> William Jennings Bryan and Hilary A. Herbert. On {{the spur of the}} moment, Herbert asked Corporal James R.

Tanner lost both legs in the war, became a stenographer, and took eyewitness testimony on behalf of the government in the hours following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He had briefly led the Bureau of Pensions in 1889, and helped organize the American Red Cross. Nonetheless, there were murmurs of disapproval from the audience when Tanner spoke.|$|E

When the United States entered World War I, Tillman was a strong supporter, seeing the conflict as democratic nations against German [...] "slaves... and not free men at all". Although he urged vigilance against spies, once he was satisfied that the accusations against German-born Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, president of the Federal Land Bank at Columbia, were unfounded, he spoke in support of the man.|$|E
