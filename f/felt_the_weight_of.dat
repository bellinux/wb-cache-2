2500|$|Stanton {{sometimes}} <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> Anthony's {{determination and}} drive. When Stanton arrived at an important meeting in 1888 with her speech not yet written, Anthony insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room {{until she had}} written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door {{to make sure she}} did so.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the Holocaust Cronbach <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the {{suffering}} of the German Jews; he wore a [...] "yellow badge", the yellow Star of David, sewn by his wife. [...] At {{the end of the war}} when Cronbach's friend Rabbi Leo Baeck returned after being imprisoned in a concentration camp he and Cronbach exchanged their yellow stars; the one Baeck had been forced to wear as a sign of oppression and the one Cronbach willingly wore in support of his suffering brethren. [...] Baeck's yellow star now resides with Cronbach's two grandsons.|$|E
60|$|I did so, and {{presently}} <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> Martina swinging on my arm.|$|E
60|$|Hodder was appalled. He <b>felt</b> {{helpless}} before <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> this onslaught.|$|R
60|$|She nestled {{close to}} him. The slave of the San Tome silver <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> as <b>of</b> chains upon his limbs, a {{pressure}} as {{of a cold}} hand upon his lips. He struggled against the spell.|$|R
60|$|Seated before Father Sobriente in the infirmary, with {{swollen and}} bandaged face, and eyes that still seemed to see {{everything}} in the murky light of his own blood, Clarence <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father's hand upon his knee.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have," [...] he assented. [...] "I {{have always}} <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> my years {{in getting the}} baggage registered; they have made the baggage weigh more every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maisie <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the question; it {{kept her}} {{silent for a}} space during which she looked at Sir Claude, whose eyes {{remained}} bent. [...] "Nothing," [...] she returned at last.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{gazed at her}} anxious face {{in a way to}} show how deeply he <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the blow he was about to give. Then, after a pause he continued.|$|E
60|$|Once I <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> great <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monsters upon my {{back and}} as keen talons sank into my flesh I {{experienced}} the frightful sensation of moist lips sucking the lifeblood from the wounds to which the claws still clung.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} at length, ladies, {{in order that}} you may {{understand}} my true position; and I wish to say that I have never <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> crushing <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> my father's disgrace more deeply than I felt it last evening. This man," [...] nodding toward the stout burglar, [...] "came to me shortly after I had eaten my supper, which {{happened to be a}} frugal one, and said to me:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Father Benedict Rosinski succeeded Kolaszewski in June, 1892, {{and soon}} {{found that he}} had to face a debt of a little over $100,000&thinsp; - &thinsp;far beyond what he and his {{congregation}} supposed it to be. The actual debt had also been kept from the knowledge of <b>the</b> Bishop. Rosinski <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> great <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his burden, but trusting to the well known and much tried generosity of his people he set to work to gradually reduce the great debt.|$|R
60|$|So {{during the}} day she looked her duty steadfastly in the face; read Wordsworth's {{astringent}} yet depressing ode to that Deity; committed herself to her guidance; and still <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> chance desires.|$|E
60|$|Mr Short {{replied in}} the affirmative with a nod and a smile. Mr Codlin added a corroborative nod and a short groan, as if he still <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the Temple on his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|From now on, {{the forces}} of Torn were {{employed}} in repeated attacks on royalist barons, encroaching ever and ever southward until even Berkshire and Surrey and Sussex <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the iron hand of the outlaw.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the hardest}} swim {{of his life and}} more than once Dave <b>felt</b> as if <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his uniform would carry him down. The two were alone in the vicinity, the others having either gone down or struck out for the uninjured boats nearest to them.|$|R
5000|$|Fynes Moryson, {{secretary}} to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, wrote drily {{that no one}} who knew anything about Ireland could possibly believe that any Irish jury would condemn Meade. Nor did they do so, maintaining that they knew that [...] "he had not intended treason in his heart". For presuming to bring in this verdict in open defiance of the Government's clearly expressed wishes they <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> full <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> official anger they were prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber, heavily fined, and ordered to stand outside Cork Courthouse holding papers proclaiming their offence.|$|R
6000|$|Gradually, {{like the}} shadow on a dial, the {{knowledge}} {{that it was time}} to rise and go crept upon them. Although they remained silent, each knew that <b>the</b> other <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> same <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> responsibility, <b>the</b> shadow-finger of the sundial travelling over them. The alternative was, not to return, to let the finger travel and be gone. But then ... Helena knew she must not let the time cross her; she must rise before it was too late, and travel before the coming finger. Siegmund hoped she would not get up. He lay in suspense, waiting.|$|R
60|$|But now I had returned. The {{work that}} fate had undone {{must be done}} again, and though I must need smile at my {{imperial}} honors, I none the less <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> duty and obligation that rested upon my shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Both Silas and I {{understood}} that Archie {{was the one}} who should act as commander of our small expedition, and we obeyed in silence, the skiff darting ahead once she <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the wind, as if understanding full well the need of speed.|$|E
60|$|As {{she threw}} the latter about her {{shoulder}} and <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the big game-gun in her hand a sudden sense of security suffused her. It was with new hope and a feeling almost of assured success that she again set forward upon her journey.|$|E
60|$|With {{these last}} words, Maggie's sobs burst forth {{with the more}} {{violence}} for the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that pressure of the heart which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision of their troubles as Maggie had, who had been at home; he only <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> crushing <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost convulsively round Maggie as she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and tearless, his eyes blank,--as if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path.|$|R
60|$|Elsa <b>felt</b> as if <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{world had}} been lifted from off her brain. All through these hours the thought of Andor having {{committed}} such an abominable crime never once entered her mind, but nevertheless when her mother told the news about Leopold Hirsch, and that the police officers had already left the village, she was conscious of an overwhelming sense of relief.|$|R
50|$|Two {{ancillary}} {{advantages to}} the suppressor are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash {{is reduced by}} both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of propellant gasses, which can contribute 30-50% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the propellant gasses. This can cause them to function somewhat like a Muzzle booster and thus increase <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> recoil. <b>The</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> suppressor and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> that additional <b>weight</b> at <b>the</b> muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due {{to the location of}} this mass.|$|R
60|$|Well {{it was for}} {{the nobles}} of the court of Okar that John Carter had been disarmed. As it was, a dozen of them <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> my clenched fists, and I had fought my way half up the steps before the throne to which Salensus Oll had carried Dejah Thoris ere ever they could stop me.|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{let himself}} be led away towards a corner. There sat Lilly and a strange man: called Levison. The room was warm. Aaron could never bear {{to be too}} hot. After sitting a minute, he rose and took off his coat, and hung it on a stand near the window. As he did so he <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his flute--it {{was still in his}} pocket. And he {{wondered}} if it was safe to leave it.|$|E
60|$|The {{crew was}} three-fourths made of Kirkcudbright {{men who had}} known the master from childhood, many of them, indeed, being older than he; they were mostly jealous of Paul, envious of the command he had {{attained}} to over them, and impatient under the discipline he was ever ready to inflict. 'Tis no light task to enforce obedience from those with whom one has birdnested. But, having more than once <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his hand, they feared him.|$|E
50|$|Ammunition {{was short}} among the French forces {{by this point}} {{and the rate of}} fire was slowed. Their reduced fire {{encouraged}} some of the German tanks to slip around their flank behind a hedge, but they were spotted and seven tanks were destroyed. The neighbouring 110th Regiment coped with the northern wing of the Panzer attack. From 05:00, the divisional reconnaissance battalion retreated onto its 1st Battalion, which <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> full <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy bombardment followed by infiltrations of enemy riflemen into Ernage, exposing the battalion's right flank. The 3rd Battalion to the north was forced back as well. Despite the support of all the divisional anti-tank weapons available and then the divisional reserve battalion, the front of the 110th remained vulnerable.|$|R
5000|$|In pistols the recoil {{from the}} fired {{cartridge}} (and the slide movement) {{will make the}} muzzle rise after each shot, and how high the bore axis sits {{in relationship to the}} hand will affect the degree of muzzle rise. A low bore axis will make most of the recoil go directly into the hand, and thus give less muzzle rise. Among other things that affect muzzle rise and <b>felt</b> recoil is <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pistol frame and tuning of recoil springs.|$|R
60|$|However, the dearest, {{almost the}} only hallowed {{form of the}} praise of man, was taken from him {{by the death of}} his father in 1799, {{immediately}} after the delight of hearing of his standing first in the Christmas examination. The expense of a return home was beyond his means, but he took to reading the Bible, as a proper form to be complied with in the days of mourning; and beginning with the Acts, as being the most entertaining part, he <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> full <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of the Apostles borne in on him, and was roused to renew his long-neglected prayers. When next he went to chapel, with his soul thus awakened, he was struck by perceiving for the first time how joy for the coming of our Lord rings through the Magnificat.|$|R
60|$|Billy Byrne, slouching by, cast {{a bitter}} look of hatred upon the two. The {{fact that he}} had saved Theriere's life had not {{increased}} his love for that gentleman. He was still much puzzled to account for the strange idiocy that had prompted him to that act; and two of his fellows had <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his mighty fist when they had spoken words of rough praise for his heroism--Billy had thought that they were kidding him.|$|E
60|$|But now his {{attention}} was diverted by {{the voice of}} Taug. The threats that had filled the ape's mouth had turned to pleas. The tightening noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his legs--he was beginning to suffer. Several apes sat near him highly interested in his predicament. They made uncomplimentary remarks about him, {{for each of them}} had <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> Taug's mighty hands and the strength of his great jaws. They were enjoying revenge.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the pair}} reached the lower creek which Henry had mentioned. Here the stream which flowed past the Morris {{homestead}} split into several arms, one flowing through a wide clearing {{and the others}} entering the forest and passing around a series of rough rocks and a cliff nearly fifty feet high. At this point the forest had never yet <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the white man's axe and trees had stood there until brought low by storm or the weight of years.|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} delighted {{with their new}} exercises, and <b>felt</b> {{confident}} that <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid mass thickly bristling with spears would break through the Danish line without difficulty, or could draw off from the field in perfect order and safety {{in case of a}} defeat, however numerous their foes. The two front lines were to thrust with their pikes, the others keeping their long spears immovable to form a solid hedge. Each man carried a short heavy sword to use in case, by any fatality, the wedge should get broken up.|$|R
60|$|And when Bobby {{thought of}} that he was spurred to fresh effort, and he pulled himself {{together}} with a desperate tension of every nerve and sinew, fighting exhaustion, ignoring pain, conjuring up the vision of Crystal's blue eyes and her pleading look as she begged him to save her from lifelong sorrow and the anguish of future loneliness. Then he no longer heard the weird and incessant cannonade, he no longer saw the desolation of this utter confusion around him, he no longer <b>felt</b> exhausted, or <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> that lifeless, impeding burden upon his saddle-bow.|$|R
5000|$|The plea {{agreement}} called for Ciavarella to serve {{up to seven}} years in prison, pay fines and restitution, and accept responsibility for the crimes. However, Ciavarella denied {{that there was a}} connection between the juvenile sentences he rendered and the kickbacks he received. In part because of this denial, on July 30, 2009, Judge Edwin M. Kosik of Federal District Court in Scranton, Pennsylvania rejected the {{plea agreement}}. He ruled that Ciavarella had continued to deny that there was a ‘quid pro quo’ between his receipt of money and his jailing of juveniles, instead characterizing the money as a [...] "finder’s fee" [...] despite what Judge Kosik <b>felt</b> was <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's evidence. [...] Attorneys for the two judges brought a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge's rejection of the plea agreement. The motion was denied on August 24, and Ciavarella and Conahan withdrew their guilty pleas, resulting in the case going to trial.|$|R
