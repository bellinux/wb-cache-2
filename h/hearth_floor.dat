2500|$|Some spodomantic rituals {{require the}} use of a certain writing surface. Most of the rituals {{outlined}} above indicate the use of the <b>hearth,</b> <b>floor,</b> or exterior ground as the place to spread ashes. But some examples of spodomancy call for the use of other types of surfaces. Consider the use of bone: Divination techniques closely related to spodomancy include osteomancy (divination using bones, particularly that practice which heats them to produce cracks which are portentious), plastromancy (divination using turtle plastrons), scapulimancy (divination using the shoulder blade; the Scottish term is slinneanachd), and sternomancy (divination using the sternum). However, in these practices, fire is used to cause cracks to appear in the bone. Ash {{may or may not be}} used to fill in these cracks, making them more visible. [...] This is not spodomancy, however, as the cracks (not the ash itself) are being read. [...] In Mongolia, however, a divinatory ritual exists in which scapulimancy and spodomancy are combined: A smooth layer of ashes is spread on the shoulder blade of a cow, sheep, or ox, and a lama is divinely inspired to make calculations in the ash which indicate answers to questions or the future. Bone is not the only alternative surface used. Some ancient Greek rituals of spodomancy required that the ashes be spread on a plank of wood rather than the floor.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} wider {{research}} programme of experimental archaeology at Calanais Farm, Isle of Lewis, Scotland, a number of experimental hearths were constructed, based on excavated evidence from the Late Iron Age houses at Bostadh, Lewis. Controlled and repeated burning of different fuel sources (well-humified peat, fibrous upper peat, peat turf and wood) was carried out {{over a number of}} burning episodes, each of three days duration. A range of mineral magnetic measurements, including remanences and the variation of susceptibility with high temperature, were taken from the resulting ash samples. The high temperature susceptibility measurements show that the fibrous upper peat and peat turf have a single magnetic component, with a drop in magnetic susceptibility at ca. 600 &# 176;C. In comparison the well-humified peat and wood have one, sometimes two, distinct magnetic components characterized by drops in susceptibility at ca. 330 and ca. 550 &# 176;C. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed on the room temperature magnetic data. A biplot of the resulting two main variables distinguishes the well-humified peat and wood. Some overlap is observed between the fibrous upper peat and peat turf. Magnetic measurements also were carried out on Iron Age and Medieval <b>hearth,</b> <b>floor</b> and ash spread samples from the multiperiod archaeological site of Guinnerso, on the Isle of Lewis. Comparison was made with the modern ash samples in order to determine if fuel sources could be identified. The high temperature susceptibility curves and the discriminant analysis biplot suggest that for the selected archaeological samples the predominant fuel source was well-humified peat...|$|E
40|$|The chrono-cultural frameworkAs {{a result}} of the studies {{presented}} here, we can give an entirely positive assessment of the contributions of the excavations carried out at the Chalcolithic sites on the Carmaux by-pass. To start with, the site of "La vayssonnié" yields a fine series of pottery (cf. Chap. 4), that is to say, 5498 shards derived from 121 individuals and comprising 42 partial forms. They make up a homogeneous vessel assemblage, except for two pieces that are unexpected but contained in well dated areas. Indeed, all the series come from closed structures, including five which have been dated by 14 C (cf. Chap. 7. 3). These dates, which are highly consistent between themselves and with the material remains, all lie between - 2600 and - 2400 years BCE. The cultural facies concerned is a Chalcolithic facies anchored in Bas- Quercy, apparently attached to the verazian sphere and the Languedocian chronology (cf. Chaps. 4. 2 and 8. 4). The site of "La Salaberdié" is much more limited, but complementary. Indeed, it relates to an occupation that is clearly a little more recent, included in a bracket ranging from - 2550 to - 2350 BCE. It is possible that there was some overlap, but the series exhibit small differences that evoke a slight diachronism. Although the pottery assemblages show a very strong affinity with each other, the presence of a Bell Beaker-type appropriation of style at "La Salaberdié" could reflect the emergence of this influence in the zone. As regards lithic industries (cf. Chaps. 5 and 9), exogenic materials such as flint, already very poorly represented at "La vayssonnié", are completely absent in the small series of "La Salaberdié". This small time shift between the two sites is rather an advantage, since it concerns two relatively close but quite distinct geographical areas. This is because it provides a reference chronology covering almost all the Chalcolithic, derived from closed assemblages (sixty of them yielding pottery). Such a reference frame was previously lacking between the garonne plain, Southern Rouergue, Larzac and the Montagne Noire (cf. Chap. 1). generally, the various types of artefacts evoke a local production, but are also attached to the Languedocian sphere, which seems relevant in this early metallurgy context. Nature of the occupationsThe chrono-cultural coherence of each site allows us to outline the spatial arrangement of the structures, since these latter also make up a reference frame (cf. Chap. 3). For the "La Vayssonnié" site alone, this reference frame comprises 127 anomalies distributed over an area of 5000 m 2, and can bebroken down into 72 proven structures including: three "kilns", nine "small pits", 13 "bowl-shaped hearths ", 21 "oblique pits " and 29 "medium and large pits". Each occupation appears to cover a rather limited time span, since only one direct section is observed. Evidently, the depth of erosion, cutting down locally to more than 0. 5 m, prevents us from observing surface works and shallow-buried structures, which leads to an important bias. However, certain activity levels appear to show through, {{as in the case of}} associations "gA and gB" (cf. Chap. 3, 1. 2). Almost all the remains of activities (carbonized seeds, abundant grinding tools, wasters on large pots) evoke the conservation and preparation of cereals. Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify the combustion structures from which these remains are derived, because of various problems that are often mentioned (erosion, pedogenesis, etc., cf. Chap. 2). However, structures A “La vayssonnié” et “La Salaberdié” 40 and A 91 (association "gB") are of a very particular type. They are strongly reminiscent of the "possible pottery-firing structure" of Nôtre Dame-de-Marceille at Limoux in the department of Aude (vaquer 1994). Attributed to the Saint-Pons or vérazian group, this latter structure exhibits a longitudinal "stepped" profile, similar to that of anomaly A 91. Its fill is also primarily composed of combustion residues thrown down in various beds. Although abundant ceramic remains are recorded at Nôtre Dame-de-Marceille, no mention is made of overfired and/or deformed elements. Pits A 40 and A 91 also evoke three combustion structures of the Early/Middle Bronze Age on Tatihou island (Manche department: Marcigny, dir. Ghesquière 2003, p. 57 to 62), which are termed "suspended kilns". However, apart from their morphology, we do not find any convincing elements of architecture (fragments of <b>hearth</b> <b>floor</b> or pillar, etc.) in our two pits. Moreover, the abundant oxidized sand component in the surrounding sediments at this site makes it impossible to observe the presence of any eventual reddening. Nevertheless, we still consider that one of these structures could have been used to produce the waster pots and/or carbonized seeds, perhaps in the context of a mixed operation, implying a possible "tiered/layered kiln". Lastly, we could also explain these structures by the burning down of a building especially reserved for agricultural activities, leaving remains composed of (varied) lithic elements trapped in storage pits with platforms (9; 40; 91). Although the structures and refuse deposits present over the remainder of the site are less evocative of pottery craft activity, they remain as a "background", which is normal for the periodconsidered. Taking into consideration the taphonomic bias, it is not possible to say whether the entire zone was dedicated to agricultural and craft activities. A possible argument in favour is the slope of the substrate, the exposure towards the North (perhaps motivated by the presence of water farther downslope), the absence of faunal remains and the striking over-representation of macro-tools. Nevertheless, the distribution of pottery volumes seems in conformity with that already observed on sub-contemporary "habitats", and it is rather unlikely that the storage structures and treatment areas were located very far away from the habitat. Consequently, we adopt the hypothesis that the area was used for generalpurposeactivities, while nevertheless containing some zones related to preferential activities (gA, gB, gF, etc.) within or near the habitat. Concerning the site of "La Salaberdié", the small number of structures (12 anomalies, including 5 proven structures, over an area of 1200 m 2 (cf. Chap. 7) makes it even more complicated to define the nature of the occupation. This site also displays features usually restricted to small domestic and generalpurpose occupations, which further highlights the importance of the probable smelting furnace at A 10. Local metallurgy of copperIn fact, the structures used for copper smelting in the South of France are so far only known from specialized sites. They generally comprise furnaces of small volume, with simple and rather shallow bowl-shaped hearths (Ambert et al. 2005; Barge 2003, p. 54 to 60; Rovira 2005 a, p. 184; 2005 b) that are more suitable for obtaining a high temperature. However, these structures have little chance of being preserved on an eroded surface such as observed at "La vayssonnié". We were able to collect some slag and shards that had been strongly altered by high temperatures, but found nothing indicative of a "reduction" process. This is found, for example, at the nearby site of "Al Claus" (Carozza 1998; Carozza et al. 1997; Carozza, Burens, Laurens 1998), whose occupation is situated in the same age bracket as "La Salaberdié", and where a score of copper-rich metal encrustations were observed on the inner walls of the shards. The authors proposed to interpret these encrustations as the residue of a reduction technique carried out directly in pots derived from the common vessel assemblage and reused as "smelting pots or crucibles", which corresponds to a technique initially documented in Spain [vasos-hornos in Spanish] (Ambert et al. 1996; Ambert, Rovira 2003, p. 285 to 287; Rovira 2005 a; Rovira, Ambert 2002). At "La Salaberdié", the carpet of shards covering the bottom of small furnace A 10 (cf. Chaps. 7 and 11) has also yielded a large number (about sixty) of scoriaceous lumps. This material also accumulated on the inner walls (i. e. concave faces) of the shards, which show an extremely high porosity indicating the attainment of high temperatures. But the shards correspond to very small fragments (412) derived from several pots (more than four), and are distributed with equal density over the bottom. Thus, the structure is not a "smelting-pot furnace" [vasos-hornos in Spanish], but rather a composite hearth. In this same structure, we find the "nozzle" or "tuyere" of a bellows, as well as an ingot mould that most probably corresponds to the mould of a flat axe similar in size to the specimen from "La vayssonnié" (cf. Chaps. 6. 2 and 11). These finds characterize the furnace as having an authentic new character. The presence of these objects, the small size of the pit and the signs of heating undoubtedly equal to or higher than 1000 °C, are all indications in favour of a smelting furnace with a hearth that represents a novel development. It probably relates to the final stages in the operational chain, including casting and moulding, since there are no proven traces of copper waste (some analyses of the slaggy residues are envisaged). As mentioned above, the framework of discovery provides a good demonstration that the final stages of the operational chain of copper metallurgy (smelting, moulding and hammering) can be carried out in a domestic context, as has already been proposed (Carozza 2005, p. 660; Maass 2005, 8; Rovira 2005 b, p. 180), even though the present example clearly involves a very specialized craft industry. Moreover, the site of "La vayssonnié" has also yielded some secondary markers of this activity, that is to say, three probable fragments of "ingot moulds" and a fine specimen of a "galet à cupules" ["pitted pebble/cupstone"] (cf. Chap. 11). But the importance of opper in these societies appears on this site in a rather spectacular way, represented by the assemblage of pit A 118 (cf. Chaps. 3 and 11). In this case, we note the deposition of a collar (cf. Chap. 6. 1) and a large flat axe (cf. Chap. 6. 2), both carefully laid out in a small hollow dug at the bottom of a pit undoubtedly of domestic origin. This corresponds to a sort of hiding-place (or cache) masked by a pot in functional position with an atypical peariform shape. The pot containing the combustion residue, made up of charcoals and carbonized seeds, then appears to have collapsed onto itself. The significance of this deposition is problematic. It could indeed represent a simple cache for copper intended for recasting, since a defect could be partly responsible for the initial breaking of this axe. However, the axe has suffered many violent and repeated blows on one of its faces, quite unrelated to any technical process, and this occurred at the beginning. Moreover, this large possibly-decorated axe is associated with a very fine composite collar comparable with some rare pieces discovered in funerary or ambiguous contexts. The atypical and vaguely anthropomorphic shape of the vase, along with the presence of carbonized seeds on its bottom, clearly argues in favour of a symbolic deposit that links together some strong elements belonging to the universe of these populations. The numerous data presented here nearly all indicate the end of the operational chain, while also providing positive evidence for a local pre-Bell Beaker copper metallurgy. On the other hand, the question of the origin of the ore remains unanswered. The southernmost edge of the Massif Central is rich in cupriferous sites. Indeed, the oldest "mining-metallurgy" site currently known is situated in its foothills, belonging to the famous Cabrières- Péret district (Ambert 1992; 1999; Ambert et al. 1996; 2005). Since the Ségala deposit In the department of Tarn also forms part of this geological unit, an ancient local extraction is strongly suspected (Servelle 1998; Servelle, Servelle 1984 and 1991). To back up this hypothesis, a campaign of "thematic prospection" and limited (manual excavation) surveys was carried out in the framework of the preparation of this publication, to look for evidence of a prehistoric working at the "Labenq" mine, located approximately 2 km from "La vayssonnié" and already known at least since Antiquity (cf. Chap. 11). The objective was also to collect in situ ore and carry out geochemical comparisons between this material and the objects of deposit A 118. Unfortunately, while the results for the axe allow us to draw some conclusions, we did not obtain enough metal from the other highly oxidized parts or the excessively thin malachite coating of the historical crosscutting galleries. In addition, this "light" approach (prospection and limited manual excavations) failed to reveal any material evidence of a prehistoric working. In fact,a preliminary indication comes from a rather unexpected source, the presence of lithic artefacts at the two archeological sites: a crusher made of "chopped/splintered" quartz and an "attractive" quartz stone with greenish inclusions, which were certainly both collected from the Labenq vein (cf. Chaps. 10 and 11). ConclusionIn conclusion, while the studied remains do not make up an ideal record (…), the new data - in many cases unpublished – resulting from the present work have led to many valuable and sometimeseven spectacular advances in the regional study of the Chalcolithic. Thus, the 72 proven structures at the site of "La vayssonnié" themselves form a reference frame, yielding a fine series of pottery that is homogeneous and datable. In addition, the lithic series displays a striking over-representation of macro-tools, while the 300, 000 carbonized seeds collected at "La vayssonnié" are clearly relevant regarding the function of the site. This function fits in with a domestic sphere where much of the activity is related to the conservation and treatment of harvests. These activities coexist explicitly here with a well-developed copper metallurgy, located at around 2550 BCE, as show by the small original smelting structure (A 10), the lithic, ceramic and slaggy remains, as well as the fine artefacts belonging to the newly discovered deposit of pit A 118. In our opinion, the various components of this assemblage plead in favour of a deposit reflecting a religious gesture, which links together certain strong symbols for these populations: axecollar/ pit-earthenware jar/cereals/fire. Finally, although we cannot formally confirm an extraction of the ore in the immediate environment of the sites, the fact that mineral substances were collected from the Labenq vein shows clearly that the Chalcolithic populations of "La vayssonnié" and "La Salaberdié" had some knowledge of this deposit. Les sites de " La Vayssonnié " et de " La Salaberdié " ont été découverts à l'occasion d'une opération de diagnostic précédant les travaux routiers de la future rocade de Carmaux (Tarn). Ces occupations, qui sont implantées sur de légères pentes, ont subi une forte érosion et se manifestent à travers la présence de structures excavées de différents types, fosses, foyers, fours, silos. Les 127 anomalies (72 structures de " La Vayssonnié " sont circonscrites dans une surface d'environ 5000 m 2, sur une pente de 10 % orientée au nord. L'extension maximale du site n'a pu être reconnue, car elle déborde le tracé à l'est. L'occupation de " La Salaberdié " est plus modeste, puisqu'elle n'a livré que 5 structures évidentes, mais elle est néanmoins très complémentaire à tous points de vue. Localisée à environ 2 km au sud-sud/ouest de " La Vayssonnié ", ses structures ont été reconnues sur une surface d'environ 1000 m 2 dans le flan méridional d'une petite colline. Le contexte des implantations est celui du " Ségala " tarnais, qui constitue l'un des contreforts de la bordure méridionale du Massif central, riches en gîtes cuprifères. Le cadre chrono-culturel concerné est le Chalcolithique stricto sensu, presque tout le Chalcolithique, puisque l'occupation de " La Vayssonnié " concerne une fourchette temporelle comprise entre 2600 à 2400, et celle de " La Salaberdié ", une fourchette un peu plus récente, comprise entre 2500 à 2300. Jusqu'à présent, l'occupation de cette région au Néolithique était surtout documentée à travers des grottes ou des dolmens, soit des milieux " ouverts " à vocation funéraire. Les habitats de " plein air " n'ont été remarqués et explorés qu'assez récemment. C'est le cas du site d'" En Guilhem " à Roquevidal (Valdeyron, Marchais 2002; Valdeyron et al. 2003) et d'" Al Claus " à Varen (Carozza, Burens, Laurens 1998). Ces deux gisements ont permis de documenter, d'une part les expressions domestiques du mobilier de la fin du Néolithique et, d'autre part, une métallurgie du cuivre assez précoce, dont l'ancienneté et le caractère complexe restaient néanmoins à préciser localement. Dans le cadre de la compréhension des sphères domestiques, artisanales et géologiques de la fin du Néolithique régional, la fouille des sites de " La Vayssonnié " et " La Salaberdié " constitue réellement un apport essentiel. Concernant l'organisation spatiale tout d'abord, si les sols et les structures de faible enfouissement font défauts, les 77 structures évidentes et les associations fonctionnelles qu'elles composent, forment une documentation variée, voire inédite. Ces structures constituent également autant d'ensembles clos qui ont notamment livré dont 42 formes partielles. Ces vases renvoient à une expression plutôt récente de la sphère vérazienne, mais les influences fontbuxiennes sont également bien perceptibles. On relève bien à priori quelques carences dans les mobiliers (nucléus, outillage en silex, os de faune), mais celles-ci semblent pourraient aussi être interprétées comme des biais relevant de la vocation fonctionnelle des occupations. En effet, l'abondance du macro-outillage, le grand nombre de fosses de type " silo " et l'important volume de palé-semences découvert (environ 300 000 individus), plaident plutôt en faveur d'une aire, ou tout au moins de zones très tournées vers le traitement des récoltes (stockage, grillage, broyage). Cependant, un des plus importants apports de ces fouilles demeure l'ensemble des informations liées à la métallurgie du cuivre, dont toute la fin de la chaîne opératoire est représentée avec les deux sites. Ainsi, les témoins se composent d'une petite structure de fusion originale, d'un bel exemplaire de galet à cupules et autres " broyons ", de nombreux résidus scoriacés, de fragments de " lingotières " et " tuyère " : ainsi que d'un dépôt d'objets totalement inédit. Ce dépôt concerne une grande hache plate associée à un beau collier composite d'un mètre de longueur, dont l'assemblage est très particulier. La hache a été intentionnellement fracturée en deux morceaux. Ces deux morceaux ont été disposés contre la paroi d'un petit surcreusement ménagé dans le fond d'une fosse. Le collier était disposé entre les deux, après avoir été soigneusement replié et enroulé dans un tissu ou un fragment de cuir, ce dernier présentant le volume d'un petit cylindre lors de la fouille. Le tout était dissimulé par le dépôt d'un vase particulier en position fonctionnelle. Enfin, ce vase recelait des restes charbonneux ainsi que des paléo-semences. Ce dépôt pourrait constituer une cache : un " trésor de cuivre ". Cependant, la nature des objets, ainsi que la mise en scène de leur association, nous font pencher pour un autre scénario...|$|E

At a later date, if the wooden building existed, it was demolished to make way for a small wheelhouse (with three projecting stone piers) in the interior. Scarcement ledges at heights of 2.1 and 3.7 metres might have supported the putative timber building. The other main feature of the ground floor is the three large cells within the walls. They are entered via thresholds which are 0.7 metres above the floor level. Above the lintel of each cell door are further openings which seem designed to let light and air into the chamber behind. The cells all have recesses, or large cupboards, set into the thickness of the wall.|$|R
40|$|A mound {{settlement}} {{in front of}} the Girmeler Cave near the major Lycian city of Tlos in SW Turkey revealed evidence for occupation during the late 9 th and 8 th millennia BC. The ccupation is characterized by a structure with at least two layers of lime-plastered <b>floor,</b> <b>hearths</b> and bins and a wattle-and-daub superstructure, all pointing to a sedentary community engaged in intensive hunting and gathering. The trial trenches at Girmeler Cave also yielded evidence of an Early Pottery Neolithic period {{at the end of the}} 8 th millennium BC. The remains of several buildings with terrazzo floors and wattle-and-daub superstructures were found. It is likely that the cave served as a sacred site in the Early Pottery Neolithic period. There was a hiatus between the late 9 th/early 8 th millennium BC and the Early Pottery Neolithic occupations at the site...|$|R

To maintain the burn, four chestnut logs would be placed inward at each corner and a small, flameless charcoal fire within the joining point at the center would slowly burn on {{the tips of the}} logs, and as the logs burned out they would be pushed slightly more into the center. The irori would be used for cooking, either with an iron pot stand or with the suspended jizai-kagi (自在鈎) which consists of an adjustable hook connected to a ceiling beam above and from which a pot could be hung, with the height adjusted according to the temperature sought. Often the jizai-kagi would be made of a bamboo pole with a carved wooden fish used for the hook adjusting mechanism (with the fish serving as a water talisman to ward off the danger of fire).|$|R

5000|$|Ainu EPIC songs, yukar, are {{performed}} as long monologues. The singer performs the song entirely from memory, and, traditionally, in a [...] "non-formal" [...] setting {{such as a}} friend’s house or before the hearth at a gathering. While somewhat casual, these epics are still more formal than the short prayer songs mentioned earlier. Both men and women recite Ainu epics, though the vocal *qualities* of women are considered preferable to those of men. The epic songs are fairly rhythmic melodic chants. The voice of the singer usually fluctuates within words, and phrases and sentences are distinguished by the melody. Singers strive for their audience to understand every word. The epic is unaccompanied by musical instruments, though at times both the singer and the listener might tap repni, or simple blocks of wood, against the <b>hearth</b> or the <b>floor</b> to help keep time and punctuate the epic. Certain paintings also show these epics being performed lying down, with the singer beating time {{on his or her}} abdomen with the hands, but this practice has faded into obscurity.|$|R

The brick floor in the room is an exact replica. Connected via a butler pantry is the kitchen, which contains its own fireplace for cooking, although modern appliances have been added to accommodate contemporary living. Connected to the kitchen is a laundry room, but the iron shackles that were found imbedded in the wall point to the original use of the room—a dungeon for quarrelsome Indians and disobedient slaves. During the 1885 restoration, a window and second door were added to the room, and it was converted into a root cellar.|$|R
5000|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} indicates {{they were built}} in a shallow sub-rectangular pit and vary fairly in depth (often relating {{to the preservation of}} the site). Some may measure 0.25m by around 2m by 1.5m, whilst examples from excavations from the 1950s onwards at West Stow in the United Kingdom are 3.7m-4.44m long x 2.72m-3.5m wide x 0.58m-0.97m deep. Within this pit were placed two (but sometimes 0, 4, or 6) substantial wooden posts in postholes {{at either end of the}} long axis. Some archaeologists have suggested that a suspended wooden floor lay over the pit and that the cavity beneath was used for storage or to control dampness, although others have disputed this, suggesting that grubenhäuser did not have suspended floors at all. A gabled roof supported by the timber posts covered the hut, which likely had no windows and had a single entrance at one end. Excavations at West Stow (UK) in the 1970s found preserved evidence of charred planks, suggestive of suspended <b>floors.</b> <b>Hearths</b> were also found, which sat partially over the edge of the sunken pits and appeared to have collapsed downwards when the structure supporting their overhanging sections (possibly a suspended floor) was removed and that a bivouac style roof would not be practical ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Unusual {{low water}} {{levels in the}} Sea of Galilee (Dead Sea Fault, Israel) have caused the recent {{exposure}} of sub-merged Late Pleistocene prehistoric sites and lacustrine sediments along the southern shores of the lake. The Ohalo II site is a large fisher–hunter–gatherers camp with in-situ brush hut <b>floors,</b> <b>hearths,</b> and a human grave. The site is radiometrically dated by 25 charcoal dates to 19, 430 BP (average, uncalibrated). The archaeological remains include quantities of excellently pre-served organic remains. These {{would not have been}} preserved without a rapid rise of lake level immediately after the occupa-tion, covering the remains with silts and sand. Recently a concentration of eight tree trunks were found about 1. 5 km south of Ohalo II, of which five trunks were identified as Salix species and dated as a single accumulation at about 16, 100 BP. The trunks, too, had to be submerged quickly together to ensure excellent preservation. The camp and the trunks were found at – 212 / – 213 m, almost 4 m below modern high water levels. We suggest that the finds represent two separate episodes of deposition during low lake levels, almost 3, 000 radiocarbon years apart, each followed by an abrupt water rise. It is possible that climatic changes caused the observed fluctuations, though earthquakes (blocking or lowering the Jordan outlet, for example) cannot be ruled out...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{archaeology}} {{has referred}} to the anthropic sediments accumulated around prehistoric settlements with the blanket term ‘midden’. This is now recognised as an inadequate term to describe the complex formation processes and functions represented in these sediments. This thesis reviewed the body of evidence accumulated {{over the past century}} of research into Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements on the islands of the Scottish North Atlantic seaboard and extrapolated the many occurrences of ‘midden’. Several contexts emerged for these sediments including interior <b>floors,</b> <b>hearths,</b> exterior occupational surfaces, dumped deposits, building construction materials and abandonment infill. In addition, ‘midden’ is described added to cultivated soils to form fertile anthrosols. The way in which prehistoric communities exploited this material for agriculture and construction has been described through geoarchaeological research which implied that to past communities ‘midden’ was a valuable resource. This {{led to the formation of}} a model based upon a human ecodynamics framework to hypothesise sediment formation pathways. Rescue excavation at the Links of Noltland, Westray provided an opportunity to conduct a holistic landscape and fine resolution based study of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlement to test this model. The research incorporated auger survey, archaeological and geoarchaeological excavation, thin section micromorphology and SEM EDX analyses. Sediments identified in literature review and recovered from the field site were described using this toolkit and set within a cultural and environmental context. Results demonstrate that anthropic materials were incorporated into all contexts examined. Discrete burning and maintenance activities were found to have taken place during the gradual accumulation of open-air anthropic sediments whilst incorporation of fuel residues and <b>hearth</b> waste into <b>floors</b> lead to the gradual formation of ‘living floors’ inside structures. An unexpected discovery was evidence of animal penning within late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age settlement and the in situ burning of stabling waste. Three types iv | P a g e of land management strategy which relied upon the input of anthropic sediments were evidenced and the range and extent of anthropic inclusions in the landscape recorded. Spatial interpolation of auger survey data utilised a new sub-surface modelling technique being developed by the British Geological Survey to explore soil stratigraphic relationships in 3 D. SEM EDX analysis supported micromorphological analysis providing chemical data for discrete inclusions and assisting in the identification of herbivore dun ash and the Orcadian funerary product ‘cramp’. SEM EDX analysis was also applied to fine organo-mineral material for statistical testing of nutrient loadings across context groups. It was found that anthropic sediments were enriched in macro and intermediate plant nutrients Mg, P, K, S and Ca compared to geological controls, and the application of anthropic material to cultivated soils improved soil fertility for the three observed land management practices. The versatility of anthropic sediments was explored through discussion of context groups based upon the results of this research and the potential significance of this material to prehistoric communities is explored...|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen is}} the Bishop's {{favorite}} room. This {{is not at}} all because {{he is a man of}} humble mind; but because the kitchen is one of the finest rooms in the house. The Bishop has neither the income nor the appetite to have his cooking done there. The windows, high up in the wall, look north and south. The north window is the largest; and if we look into the kitchen through it we see facing us the south wall with small Norman windows and an open door near the corner to the left. Through this door we have a glimpse of the garden, and of a garden chair in the sunshine. In the right-hand corner is an entrance to a vaulted circular chamber with a winding stair leading up through a tower to the upper floors of the palace. In the wall to our right is the immense fireplace, with its huge spit like a baby crane, and a collection of old iron and brass instruments which pass as the original furniture of the fire, though as a matter of fact they have been picked up from time to time by the Bishop at secondhand shops. In the near end of the left hand wall a small Norman door gives access to the Bishop's study, formerly a scullery. Further along, a great oak chest stands against the wall. Across the middle of the kitchen is a big timber table surrounded by eleven stout rush-bottomed chairs: four on the far side, three on the near side, and two at each end. There is a big chair with railed back and sides on the <b>hearth.</b> On the <b>floor</b> is a drugget of thick fibre matting. The only other piece of furniture is a clock with a wooden dial about as large as the bottom of a washtub, the weights, chains, and pendulum being of corresponding magnitude; but the Bishop has long since abandoned the attempt to keep it going. It hangs above the oak chest.|$|R
