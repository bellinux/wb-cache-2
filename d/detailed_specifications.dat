5|$|On 8 September 1966, General McConnell {{ordered that}} a {{specialized}} CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained; on 22 December, a Requirements Action Directive (RAD) was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed. On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released {{a request for}} information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The objective {{was to create a}} design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. In 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force asked Pierre Sprey to write the <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> for the proposed A-X project; Sprey's initial involvement was kept secret due to his earlier controversial involvement in the F-X project. Sprey's discussions with Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, low-speed maneuverability, massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; possessing the best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129, and Skyraider. The specifications also demanded that each aircraft cost less than $3million. Sprey required that the biography of World War II Luftwaffe attack pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel be read by people on the A-X program.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} from the 1950s onwards, vast dams and {{irrigation}} schemes were constructed, causing a massive rise in water-borne infections from schistosomiasis. The <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. Irrigation schemes can be designed to {{make it hard for}} the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population. Even though guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise the spread of the disease had been published years before, the designers were unaware of them. The dams appear to have reduced the population of the large migratory prawn Macrobrachium. After the construction of fourteen large dams, greater increases in schistosomiasis occurred in the historical habitats of native prawns than in other areas. Further, at the 1986 Diama Dam on the Senegal River, restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human schistosomiasis reinfection rate.|$|E
25|$|Commodore had a {{reputation}} for announcing products that never appeared, so sought to quickly ship the C64. Production began in spring 1982 and volume shipments began in August. The C64 faced a wide range of competing home computers, but with a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors. In the United States the greatest competitors were the Atari 8-bit 400, the Atari 800, and the AppleII. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. The latest revision in the aging Apple II line, the Apple IIe, had higher-resolution graphics modes than the C64. Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an open architecture system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external ROM cartridge port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> for most of their models since the PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception. Initial C64 sales were nonetheless relatively slow {{due to a lack of}} software, reliability issues with early production models, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983 however, a trickle of software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing, especially with price cuts from $600 to just $300.|$|E

500|$|This was reaffirmed by {{a decree}} of the Council of Ministers on 28 January 1947. By August 1947, the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry had winnowed down design {{proposals}} to only three, one from each armed with 305mm guns and a joint design armed with 220mm guns. The latter's design was slightly smaller (...) than the Navy's [...] design, {{and had an}} armor belt [...] thinner, but was otherwise almost identical. The joint design was [...] smaller with a reduced secondary armament, but was about [...] faster.

But even this was subject to more delays as the <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> had to be approved and this didn't occur until 31 August 1948, likely delayed by the Tito–Stalin split and the start of the Berlin Blockade, both in June.|$|E

2500|$|By December 2013, the UCLASS concept {{aircraft}} {{had shifted}} around significantly. [...] Original requirements that were {{for a relatively}} simple ISR platform, were changed to a [...] "heavy-end" [...] ISR and strike aircraft with growth for weapons and sensors. [...] It was planned to weigh , {{about the size of}} the F-14 Tomcat and much larger than the X-47B, and be around [...] in length, longer than the F/A-18 Super Hornet, with endurance potentially up to 14 hours. [...] Other roles were being considered such as an aerial refueling platform to extend the range of fighters, transferring [...] of fuel and still staying airborne for up to 7.5 hours. The four industry teams pushed back against the idea of a more capable UCLASS because the specifications would be significantly different from aircraft they developed for the PDR phase, and cost per aircraft would also increase from $35-$50 million to $100 million. [...] Top-level UCLASS requirements of providing 24-hour persistent ISR coverage from the carrier at “tactically significant” ranges with limited strike capabilities at mid-to-long ranges remained fixed since spring 2013, though <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> had been refined. Cost constraints drove Navy requirements for the UCLASS. [...] One requirement that had remained constant was for the aircraft to conduct ISR orbits at tactically significant ranges for $150 million, meaning two air vehicles costing $75 million each can cover one orbit if they have an endurance of 14 hours.|$|E
