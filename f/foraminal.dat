To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no other study that quantifies the normal lumbar foramen 3 D geometry considering sex, age groups, and spinal levels in vivo. METHODS: Subject-based 3 D computed tomographic lumbar models were created in 59 asymptomatic volunteers and <b>foraminal</b> height and width were measured {{on the basis of the}} model by custom software. The <b>foraminal</b> height and width were compared by sex, age, and lumbar level. RESULTS: Overall, the <b>foraminal</b> height decreased with age. However, although the <b>foraminal</b> height in males decreased with age at all spinal levels, the <b>foraminal</b> heights in females did not. The <b>foraminal</b> height was significantly larger in the upper lumbar levels in both sexes. The <b>foraminal</b> width in males was significantly smaller than in females for all age groups. The <b>foraminal</b> width in both sexes also decreased similarly with age. The <b>foraminal</b> widths at the lower lumbar levels were significantly smaller than those at the upper levels.

40|$|Purpose: Cervical <b>foraminal</b> {{injection}} {{performed with}} a direct <b>foraminal</b> approach may induce serious neurologic complications. We describe a technique of CT-guided cervical facet joint (CFJ) injection as an indirect <b>foraminal</b> injection, including feasibility and diffusion pathways of the contrast agent. Methods and materials: Retrospective study included 84 punctures in 65 consecutive patients presenting neck pain and/or radiculopathy related to osteoarthritis or soft disc herniation. CT images {{were obtained from}} C 2 to T 1 in supine position, with a metallic landmark on the skin. CFJ punctures were performed by MSK senior radiologists with a lateral approach. CT control of the CFJ opacification was performed after injections of contrast agent (1 ml), followed by slow-acting corticosteroid (25 mg). CFJ opacification was considered as successful when joint space and/or capsular recess opacification occurred. The diffusion of contrast agent in <b>foraminal</b> and epidural spaces was recorded. We assessed the epidural diffusion both on axial and sagittal images, with a classification in two groups (small diffusion or large diffusion). Results: CFJ opacification was successful in 82 % (69 / 84). An epidural and/or <b>foraminal</b> opacification was obtained in 74 % (51 / 69). A <b>foraminal</b> opacification occurred in 92 % (47 / 51) and an epidural opacification in 63 % (32 / 51), with small diffusion in 47 % (15 / 32) and large diffusion in 53 % (17 / 32). No complication occurred. Conclusion: CT- guided CFJ injection is easy to perform and safe.

Design: This study evaluated the <b>foraminal</b> space at C 5 -C 6 in cadaver specimens during flexion and traction of the cervical spine. Setting: An orthopedic biomechanics laboratory and depart-ment of radiology of a university medical center. Patients or Other Participants: Nine cadaver cervical spines, Cl through T 3, were used in the study. Superficial tissues were dissected, preserving the ligaments. Interventions: Proximal and distal portions of the cadaver spines were potted using bone cement. Spines were mounted and imaged with computed tomography in neutral position, 15 ” of flexion, and maximum flexion with and without 251 bs of axial traction. Main Outcome Measures: The areas and volumes of the foramen were measured and calculated. Results: Flexion alone significantly increased the <b>foraminal</b> volume and isthmus area at C 5 -C 6. Traction resulted in little additional change.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of CT-guided CTSI is {{to inject}} {{medication}} into the <b>foraminal</b> region where the nerve root is inflamed. The optimal location for needle placement and therapeutic delivery, however, remain uncertain. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate how needle positioning and angle of approach impact the transforaminal distribution of injectate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed fluoroscopic images from 90 CT-guided CTSI procedures for needle-tip location, needle angle, and contrast distribution. Needle-tip position was categorized as either <b>foraminal</b> zone, junctional, or extraforam-inal. Distribution of contrast injected immediately before steroid administration was categorized as central epidural, intraforaminal, or extraforaminal in location. Needle-tip location and angle were correlated with contrast distribution. RESULTS: The needle tip was most commonly placed in the junctional position (36 cases, 40 %), followed by <b>foraminal</b> (30 cases, 33 %) and extraforaminal (24 cases, 27 %) locations. Intraforaminal contrast distribution was highest when the needle location was <b>foraminal</b> (30 / 30, 100 %) or junctional (35 / 36, 97 %), compared with extraforaminal (7 / 24, 29 %) (P value. 0001). There was no relationship between needle angle and contrast distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Needle-tip location at the outer edge of the neural foramen (junctional location) correlated well with intraforaminal distribution of contrast for CT-guided CTSI and compared favorably with injectate distribution following <b>foraminal</b> zone needle position-ing.

40|$|Objective—To measure {{effects of}} dog {{position}} on L 7 -S 1 intervertebral <b>foraminal</b> area and lumbosacral (LS) angle {{by means of}} computed tomography (CT) and determine whether changes in values between positions are associated with clinical signs in dogs with LS disease. Animals— 86 dogs examined via a positional CT protocol that included flexion and extension scans of L 7 -S 1. Procedures—Archived CT images and medical records were reviewed. Included dogs had good-quality flexion and extension CT scans of L 7 -S 1 and no evidence of fractures, neoplasia, or previous LS surgery. One person who was unaware of CT findings recorded clinical status with regard to 3 signs of LS disease (right or left hind limb lameness and LS pain) {{at the time of}} CT evaluation. One person who was unaware of clinical findings measured L 7 -S 1 <b>foraminal</b> areas and LS angles, with the aid of an image-analysis workstation and reformatted parasagittal planar CT images. Results—Intraobserver variation for measurements of L 7 -S 1 <b>foraminal</b> area ranged from 6. 4 % to 6. 6 %. Mean <b>foraminal</b> area and LS angle were significantly smaller when vertebral columns were extended versus flexed. Percentage positional change in L 7 -S 1 <b>foraminal</b> area or LS angle was not significantly different among dogs with versus without each clinical sign. There was a significant correlation between percentage positional change in L 7 -S 1 <b>foraminal</b> area and LS angle in dogs with versus without ipsilateral hind limb lameness and LS pain.

Better understanding of the {{dimensions of}} the foramen may be useful in surgical planning. This study describes a reproducible method for measurement of the thoracic foramen in AIS using computerized tomography (CT). Methods - In 23 pre-operative female patients with Lenke 1 type AIS with right side convexity major curves confined to the thoracic spine the <b>foraminal</b> height (FH), <b>foraminal</b> width (FW), pedicle to superior articular process distance (P-SAP) and cross sectional <b>foraminal</b> area (FA) were measured using multi planar reconstructed CT. Measurements were made at entrance, midpoint and exit of the thoracic foramina from T 1 /T 2 to T 11 /T 12. Results were also correlated with dependent variables of major curve Cobb Angle measured on X-ray and CT, Age, Weight, Lenke classification subtype, Risser Grade and number of spinal levels in the major curve. Results - The FH, FW, P-SAP and FA dimensions and ratios are all significantly larger on the convexity of the major curve and maximal at or close to the apex. Mean thoracic <b>foraminal</b> dimensions change in a predictable manner relative to position on the major thoracic curve.

40|$|Abstract: Study Design. In Study 1 {{the authors}} {{measured}} the vertical and sagittal dimensions of the intervertebral foramen in dried lumbar vertebrae. In Study 2 {{the dimensions of the}} intervertebral foramen were measured in fresh cadaveric spines in which the soft tissues forming the <b>foraminal</b> walls were preserved. Objectives. To investigate whether disc narrowing, or other factors related to the morphometry of lumbar vertebrae, may predispose to <b>foraminal</b> stenosis. Summary of Background Data. Predisposing factors to <b>foraminal</b> stenosis have been little investigated. Previous studies suggested that narrowing of the disc space might cause a reduction in the <b>foraminal</b> dimensions; however, {{it is not clear whether}} such a reduction is to such an extent as to compress the nerve root within the foramen. Methods. In Study 1 the vertical and sagittal dimensions of 160 intervertebral foramens were measured on dried white spines. Measurements were performed in the presence of a normal height of the disc space, obtained using a silicone rubber disc, and repeated in the same specimen after disc removal. <b>Foraminal</b> dimensions were then related to the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and the pedicle length. In Study 2, the authors evaluated the dimensions of 50 intervertebral foramens of fresh cadaveric spines, in which the soft tissues forming the <b>foraminal</b> walls and the nerve root were preserved. In specimens showing normal or slightly decreased disc height, the <b>foraminal</b> dimensions were measured before and after disc excision. Results. In Study 1 the reduction in the <b>foraminal</b> height after disc removal was, on average, 6. 5 mm (P < 0. 0001). In both Studies 1 and 2 the sagittal dimensions of the foramen were not significantly reduced after disc removal. No significant difference was found in Study 1 in the sagittal dimensions of the foramen between specimens showing normal or degenerated facet joints. In Study 2 a compression of the nerve root within the foramen was found in one specimen, showing a concomitant central stenosis at multiple levels. A significant correlation was found between the sagittal diameters of the foramen and the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and the pedicle length. Conclusions. Narrowing of the disc space significantly reduces the vertical diameter of the foramen but has no significant effects on its sagittal dimensions. In contrast, the sagittal dimensions of the foramen are strictly related to the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and the pedicle length. These results suggest that in patients with developmental or combined stenosis of the central spinal canal, a concomitant <b>foraminal</b> stenosis is likely to be present, or at least should be suspected...|$|E
