For years, the CGT and the PCF were close and almost <b>indissociable</b> allies - notably in May 1968 when both the CGT and PCF were eager for a restoration of social order and welcomed the Grenelle agreements. While the CGT has remained the largest trade union in France, it has taken its independence vis-à-vis the PCF.

40|$|Titulaire d'un diplôme en Ingénierie Informatique (Université de Valparaíso, Chili), et possédant une fructueuse expérience {{professionnelle}} axée principalement sur l'enseignement et la recherche, j'ai obtenu mon Master en Sciences Cognitives à l'Ecole Normale Supérieure (rue d'Ulm, Paris) et ma thèse de doctorat à l'Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France). I will {{propose a}} theoretical framework (conceptualization and formalization) which seeks to model obesity {{as a process of}} transformation of one's own body determined by individual (physical and psychological), inter-individual (relational, relationship between the individual and others) and socio-cultural factors (environmental, relationship between the individual and his milieu). Individual and inter-individual factors are tied to each other in a socio-cultural context whose impact is notably related to the visibility of any body being exposed on the public stage in a non-contingent way. To investigate obesity in this multifactorial manner, this paper is divided in two main parts. First, I take into account these inseparable factors to analyze the impact through time that obese individual transformation may have on the social structure. With this aim, I develop a network model in which individual interactions are in part due to homophilic selection/deselection, i. e. preferential attachment and detachment of inter-individual links according to characteristics of the individuals involved. Homophily is here defined as the tendency of an individual to create links with other individuals sharing similar attributes with him and to cut links with other dissimilar individuals. Homophily suggests that individuals tend to interact with those who resemble them. Second, and reciprocally, I study the role which could be played by the structure of the social fabric in the increase and current development of obesity. I evaluate the impact of micro level (i. e : relations between individuals) as well as the impact of meso level (i. e : relations between districts) and between macro level (i. e :countries). This approach highlights the necessity to integrate the dynamics of each scale to better understand the evolution of the pathology. With this aim, I use two stochastic models : epidemiological compartmental model and individual centered network model, considering three influences : exogenous heterogeneous (individual- cultural), exogenous homogeneous (individual-social) and endogenous (individual-individual). All together, this investigation of obesity will allow me to investigate the social and cultural dimension involved in being and transforming one's body. Ce travail porte sur le développement d'un cadre théorique (conceptualisation et formalisation) qui cherche à modéliser l'obésité comme un processus de transformation du corps de l'individu obèse, déterminé par des facteurs individuels, inter-individuels, sociaux et culturels. J'ai d'abord pris en compte ces facteurs <b>indissociables,</b> pour analyser l'impact dans le temps d'une telle transformation individuelle sur la structure sociale. Pour ce faire, j'ai développé un modèle de réseau, dans lequel une partie des interactions individuelles sont dues à une sélection/désélection homophilique, consistant en un détachement et un attachement préférentiels de liens, selon les propriétés des individus. Deuxièmement, et réciproquement, j'étudie le rôle que pourrait jouer la structure du tissu social dans l'actuel développement de l'obésité. J'utilise pour cela deux modèles stochastiques : un modèle épidémiologique à compartiments et un modèle de réseau individu-centré considérant deux types d'influences : exogène (environnement-individu) et endogène (individu-individu) ...|$|R
40|$|A large {{percentage}} of art has always been devoted to {{the images of the}} feminine. In Greco-Roman as well as in Judeo-Christian iconography, these multiple representations are synonymous with confusion and ambivalence. The common link between woman and her image is the ability to arouse distrust and fascination. By means of an in-depth study of some key figures from the history of art, we hereby put forward a post-feminist review of the diverse facets of the feminine, viewed under the sacred/secular dyad. Myths and faiths gave rise to a pagan-Christian hybrid, bringing forth a constant “Eternal Feminine” that is still firmly rooted in contemporary art. It is sometimes the faith of the image, sometimes its condemnation, that encapsulates the unresolvable fight between the human and the divine. Woman will remain forever the obscure element that is associated with appearance and beauty. In the course of our research, we ascertained that woman and painting are in perfect harmony; they are inseparable because iconoclasm and misogyny often go hand in hand. Step by step, the body will replaces the canvas and the make-up, the painting of transgender artists. In queer parodies between exhibition and shamanism, they reinvent their transformation into the feminine. The surface of the work becomes a mirror that reflects this Other, the alter ego, so longed for. Feminist thinking is set in motion through the revolutions of genders. Artists of the 20 th and 21 st centuries offer us a vision of an ideal without an original, a new Pygmalion or Narcissus, somewhere between masquerade and melancholy. Finally, we return to the art of the women. Divided between violence, humour and charis, their methods are often borderline, in their quest for the sacred that is beyond religion. They offer to evolve into “pandorien” art to shatter for ever the henceforth overly famous idea: «be beautiful and remain silent! »L’Art a toujours consacré une grande part à l’image du féminin. Que cela soit dans l’iconographie gréco-romaine ou judéo-chrétienne, ses multiples représentations sont synonymes de confusion et d’ambivalence. La femme et l’image ont en commun de susciter méfiance et fascination. C’est au travers de l’étude approfondie de quelques figures clefs de l’histoire de l’art, que nous vous proposons une relecture post-féministe des diverses facettes du féminin, prises dans la dyade sacré/profane. Mythes et croyances donnèrent naissance à un métissage pagano-chrétien qui fit émerger un Eternel Féminin inébranlable encore très prégnant dans l’art actuel. Tantôt dans la foi de l’image, tantôt dans sa condamnation, ainsi se résume l’insoluble combat entre l’humain et le divin. La Femme restera à jamais l’élément trouble associé au paraître et à la beauté. Dans nos recherches nous avons constaté que la femme et la peinture sont en parfaite adéquation. Elles sont <b>indissociables</b> car iconoclasme et misogynie vont souvent de pair. Peu à peu, le corps remplacera la toile et le fard, la peinture pour les artistes transgenres. Dans d’étranges (queer) parodies entre exhibition et chamanisme, ils réinventeront leur devenir-féminin. La surface de l’œuvre devient alors le miroir où se reflète cet Autre, alter ego tant recherché. La pensée féministe se met en marche au travers des révolutions des genres et des sexes. Ainsi, c’est entre Pygmalion et Narcisse que les artistes des XXéme et XXIéme siècles, nous offrent, entre mascarade et mélancolie, la vision d’un idéal sans original. Enfin, nous revenons sur l’art des femmes. Leurs pratiques sont souvent borderline, partagées entre violence, humour et Charis dans leur quête d’un sacré hors religion. Elles offrent un devenir-pandorien de l’art pour briser à jamais le désormais trop célèbre : « Sois belle et tais toi!...|$|R

5000|$|Opposed to a {{biological}} and voluntary {{conception of the}} Wille zur Macht, Heidegger also argued that the will to power {{must be considered in}} relation to the Übermensch and the thought of eternal recurrence—although this reading itself has been criticized by Mazzino Montinari as a [...] "macroscopic Nietzsche". Gilles Deleuze also emphasized the connection between the will to power and eternal return. Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful {{to point out that the}} primary nature of will to power is unconscious. This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other. This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension. Derrida is careful not to confine the will to power to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually. It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force. A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always <b>indissociable</b> from the will to power. The eternal return of all memory initiated by the will to power is an entropic force again inherent to all life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of a hostile force is necessarily distinct from an enemy force or opposing force (which require a formal declaration of war or joint resolution authorizing {{use of military force}} or some other evidence of a protracted conflict, respectively), since captives of enemy and opposing armed forces fall under the automatic qualification of the original 1985 statute that the amendment modified. Thus, the 1989 amendment applied only to those held outside of armed conflict, which also meant that hostility was a designation that did not require armed conflict. The [...] USS Pueblo [...] crew's detention in North Korea was mentioned explicitly in the conference report for the amendment, clearly indicating that North Korea qualified as a hostile foreign armed force. [...] A conservative interpretation of the hostile force requirement sometimes resulted in denial of the medal for internees of neutral countries and hostages of terrorists, since in both cases ill-treatment during captivity is not necessarily condoned at the level of state policy. For example, Air Force attorneys argued in Board for Correction of Military Records cases that neutrality and hostility were mutually exclusive, despite the fact that incidents have occurred where captives of neutrals were severely mistreated by hostile individuals. This interpretation was at odds with international law, which only recognizes states that are belligerent and those that are not. Hostile forces distinct from enemy forces bear no mention and have no meaning under international law. Thus, hostile forces are merely a vague sub-category of non-belligerence. Furthermore, treaty law frequently commingles so-called “non-belligerents” and neutral states, making them <b>indissociable.</b> For example, the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War makes virtually no distinction between non-belligerents and neutrals, and imposes many of the same duties on both.|$|E

40|$|AT THE CROSSROADS BETWEEN SOCIAL-GEOGRAPHY AND GEO-HISTORY. SOCIAL, SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DIMENSIONS. – Beyond {{the general}} title, this {{contribution}} offers work hypotheses {{to tackle the}} question of the <b>indissociable</b> nature of those three dimensions. It examines three notions, important to geography : space, border, scale. Far from being incompatible or contrary, the two approaches seem more complementary : to go thoroughly into space analyses in social-geography and {{to pay more attention to}} scale interactions in geo-history. The geo-historical approach takes into the temporal thickness greater account whereas temporal immediacy is more typical to social-geography. Different research purposes? Different methodology? Certainly, however this does not mean that those differences must be seen as obstacles. The basic idea is not to juxtapose the two approaches but on the contrary to combine them for the build up of the research purpose and above all in the analyses process. Examining the historical evolution of socio-spatial phenomena would allow, on one hand to distinguish structural and circumstances elements and on the other hand, to try to explain how and why those phenomena had various evolution in various territories. In other words, it is important to pay more attention to those various, unequal and formed into a hierarchy socio-spatial expressions, considering the functional aspects of everyday life (living, working, etc…) and the interactions that act on them. Geography, as a social science, expresses the evolutionary organisation of the space, as the result of “natural” dynamics, socio-economical dynamics, successive political ideologies, but above all of tensions and contrasts, generated at multi-scalar or trans-scalar levels (taking into consideration the <b>indissociable</b> nature of spatial, social and temporal dimensions) ...|$|E

La phase de bouleversements des deux dernières décennies du XVIIe siècle s'achève avec le traité de Ryswick (1697) qui avalise au regard du droit international les nouveautés religieuses favorables au catholicisme; les fondements de la paix d'Osnabrück (1648) doivent alors cohabiter avec une nouvelle règle confessionnelle qui reconnaît le culte public aux catholiques.

40|$|Jean-François Narot-Narodetzki, The {{subject of}} misknowledge From Marx and the revolutionary {{tradition}} to Freud, {{the very same}} subjective paradigm entails, in a conversely symmetrical way, the twofold and <b>indissociable</b> misknowledge of the subject and of the historical social. On the one hand, the subject of history as an illusory subsumption of a plurality within a unity of both a being and a project shared in common. On the other hand, the reduction of collective endeavours to the scheme of a psychical personality thus consequently leading {{to that of the}} becoming towards repetition. Beyond such blind alleys and as far from psychologism as from "subjectlesses processes" and structural anhistoricity the concept of a subject form enables one to renew into the subject's identity his own historicity and understand the social reproduction.

40|$|Norman Bowen, Profession and Power in the Social Sciences in the United States The professionalization {{of social}} science in the United States {{resulted}} in a utilitarian rather than a pure conception of science. University-based social scientists established knowledge claims based on positivist theories of science, but did so {{as part of a}} large strategy aimed at influencing progressive reform, gaining access to government and obtaining reliable independent sources of financial support. Science was <b>indissociable</b> from a belief in American democracy itself. Formalized ties to government research and private foundations allowed for expanded legitimacy and especially considerable influence over the process of the restructuring of the American state in the Twentieth Century. However, social science remained vulnerable to partisan attacks inherent in the American political process, especially periodic anti-communism, and generally defended itself with claims to scientific neutrality.

40|$|ISSN 0761 - 8980 International audienceThere are {{two main}} types of {{approach}} which govern the supply of public transport in major built up areas. There are the mass transportation, which leads to introduction of rail-based transport systems (underground railways or trams) and that of distribution, which aims to provide a dense network of bus routes. These two major types of transport system have very different characteristics, in terms of costs and level and quality of service. This dual nature of supply opens the way for an additional level which is concerned with ensuring that the network is connected at nodal points which operate as multimodal exchange centres. This paper discusses the characteristics {{of this type of}} intermediate network, which is based on an <b>indissociable</b> triple association of equipment / infrastructure / level of service, as such a network has been envisaged {{in the case of the}} Lyon conurbation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overlapping generations model of environmental externalities with a depollution technology. Each agent {{concerned by the}} environmental degradation can voluntarily contribute {{in order to reduce}} it. Contributing to the environmental quality means financing depollution activities and uncertainty concerns its efficiency since it's not always clear or certain what effects will result from a reduction of pollution. We show that if an agent is su#ciently risk averse, voluntary contribution is a decreasing function of average efficiency of depollution technology. If on the contrary, the substitution e#ect is weaker than the pollution e#ect, the opposite holds. We show that precaution about environmental quality has two possible consequencies which depend on agent risk aversion. Therefore, understanding the implication of precautionary attitude, leads us to the consideration of the agents' risk aversion characterization and studying the e#ect of an increase in risk aversion implies a knowledge on prudent attitude. So, we have to conclude that precaution and risk aversion are two complementary and <b>indissociable</b> concepts...|$|E
