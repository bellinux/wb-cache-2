5|$|Because Virginia Tech <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> to Indiana {{to begin}} the game, Indiana <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> to Virginia Tech {{to begin the}} second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E

Several expansion disks were released for <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2. In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 3 in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 apart from the name. Anco Software published the first versions of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> for the Amiga and Atari ST.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco {{and signed}} a {{contract}} for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had {{little in common with}} <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> and <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2. In 2001-2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> and Player Manager series. <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2002 was released. Anco started to work on another sequel <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2004 which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Steerable motors {{are used}} to drill the <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> point. When {{drilling}} the <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> point be sure to avoid drilling a soft formation immediately below a hard one. In hard abrasive formations the high side forces at <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> can cause severe bit shank wear. Ideally the <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> point should be selected in a non-abrasive homogenous formation.|$|R
50|$|After {{the release}} of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> several sequels were {{released}}. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off).</b> <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to <b>Kick</b> <b>Off.</b> The game introduced {{a number of new}} features as well as several small alterations.|$|R

5|$|After {{ten minutes}} {{interval}} {{the ball was}} again put in play, this time being <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> by the Cliftons.

5000|$|Super <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> {{is one of}} the {{follow-ups}} of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> and <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 for Game Boy, SEGA and SNES.

MegaTech gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that the [...] "feel and playability is unrivalled by any other footy game so far", but criticising the high price of £45.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In American football, the scoring team <b>kicks</b> <b>off,</b> except after a safety.

5000|$|Dino Dini's Goal is {{a soccer}} {{computer}} game released by Virgin Games in 1993. It {{is considered by}} many to be the [...] "true" [...] sequel to <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 (in preference to the official <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 3), as <b>Kick</b> <b>Off's</b> creator Dino Dini had moved from Anco Software and was responsible for all Goal's engineering and game design. Goal! introduced improved dynamics and A.I. over <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2, as well as other innovative features, such as multiple camera views. The game shipped 60,000 units on the first day of release.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 was {{released}} by Anco. <b>Kick</b> <b>Off</b> 2 retains the pace and accuracy of <b>Kick</b> <b>Off,</b> with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc., in correct proportions.
