2500|$|Most of Zambia (around 80%) {{is in this}} {{extensive}} biome. Six ecoregions {{are represented}} of which the first four listed below are woodland savannas, consisting of a grass cover 1–2 m high, and hardwood deciduous trees and/or hardwood shrubs, which range in <b>ground</b> <b>coverage</b> from 'scattered' to 'abundant'. Leguminous tree species dominate, which are deciduous, losing leaves in the dry season and producing a flush of new leaves, often reddish, just {{before the onset of}} the rains. In higher rainfall areas of Zambia the proportion and size of trees are at the higher extreme for this biome, with a canopy covering up to 40% of the ground [...] and trees often exceeding 10 m in height. However, except {{in the case of the}} last ecoregion listed, even where the canopy is extensive, at ground level the woodland is relatively open, affording quite easy passage by animals and people.|$|E

40|$|Cloud and Shadow removal is a {{significant}} step in remote sensing image process. As we all know, the <b>ground</b> object <b>coverage</b> type of the same area of the remote sensing image has little change in the short term. But for cloud and shadow <b>coverage</b> areas, the <b>ground</b> object <b>coverage</b> type has large change. Therefore, according {{to the difference between}} the two Landsat / OLI images caused by changes in the cover, this paper presents a method of extracting clouds and shadows based on differences in luminance values. This method selects two thresholds for the difference of brightness values, and extracts the clouds and shadows respectively, and validates them with random point method, which can obtain high precision of extracting cloud and shadow and satisfy the actual application needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{signature of}} terrestrial storage changes inferred from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has been assessed {{by comparison with}} outputs from a calibrated hydrological model (lumped elementary watershed (LEW)) of the upper Zambezi and surroundings and an inspection of the within?month <b>ground</b> track <b>coverage</b> of GRACE together with spatial?temporal rainfall patterns. The comparison of the hydrological model with GRACE reveals temporal inconsistencies between both data sets. Because the LEW model has been calibrated and validated with independent data sources, {{we believe that this}} is a GRACE artifact. The within?month <b>ground</b> track <b>coverage</b> shows an irregular orbit behavior which may well cause aliasing in the GRACE monthly deconvolutions.

40|$|Automatic {{information}} extraction from satellite images is {{the base of}} remote sensing image archives with contentbased query services. Pyramidal image models based on multiscale Markov random fields in combination with a texture model proved to yield good classification and segmentation results. The texture model is used for initial soft classification and then the optimal segmentation given the classification is found using a hierarchical process. Segment probabilities are calculated in a fine-to-rough analysis and segmentation is performed by a rough-to-fine decision algorithm. Previously proposed models optimise {{the strength of the}} dependencies in a fixed hierarchical structure. In our model we allow the dependencies to switch, so that the hierarchical structure itself is optimised. Our model is exactly tractable, achieves very smooth segmentations, even at coarse scale, and can be fast computed. IMAGE CHARACTERIZATION IN REMOTE SENSING In remote sensing the goal of image characterization is the identification of regions with homogenous behaviour which correspond to specific surface types and <b>ground</b> <b>coverages.</b> Texture and multispectral models [10] are means to classify pixels individually. However they often perform poorly in noisy images since they do not consider the surrounding neighbourhood of a pixel and they do not impose any smoothness constraints on the regions...|$|R

40|$|Canada {{has several}} of Earth's largest lakes and many small lakes. Heat storage and {{circulation}} are greatly affected by lakes. Currently the Canadian Regional climate model does not incorporate a lake component. Therefore, we are linking atmospheric and lake models for such applications as climate prediction and assessing {{changes in the}} lake water quality and quantity. We investigate use of highly parallel arrays of clustered processors, available through Canada's SHARCNET. The accuracy of lake, land and atmospheric models depends on grid spacing. Coarser grids adversely affect accuracy. Regional climate model inputs are required subhourly, placing a lower bound on the grid sizes that can be employed. We link a one-dimensional lake model such as the Dynamic Reservoir Model (DYRESM) to a Regional Climate model (RCM) to incorporate the effects of lake on the regional climate. The land model used is the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). CLASS and DYRESM are vertical models, with no interaction between horizontally neighboring nodes. CLASS computes heat and moisture fluxes for bare <b>ground</b> (fractional <b>coverage</b> by <b>ground,</b> FG), snow-covered <b>ground</b> (fractional <b>coverage</b> by snow, FSN), ground with canopy (fractional <b>coverage</b> by <b>ground,</b> FC), and ground with both snow and canopy.
