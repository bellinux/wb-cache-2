25|$|Earlier, {{household}} {{clothes dryers}} sometimes incorporated a germicidal lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240V countries was a circleline tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains <b>filament</b> <b>lamp.</b> Self ballasted mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{correlated}} {{color temperature}} of factory installed automotive HID headlamps is between 4100K and 5000K while tungsten-halogen lamps are at 3000K to 3550K. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of an automotive HID headlamp is discontinuous and spikey while the SPD of a <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> {{like that of the}} sun, is a continuous curve. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) of tungsten-halogen headlamps (98) is much closer than that of HID headlamps (~75) to standardized sunlight (100). Studies have shown no significant safety effect of this degree of CRI variation in headlighting.|$|E
25|$|Swan's {{carbon rod}} lamp and carbon <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> while functional, were still {{relatively}} impractical due to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While {{searching for a}} better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881 he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitro-cellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.|$|E

40|$|The aging {{characteristics}} and lifetimes of tungsten <b>filament</b> encoder <b>lamps</b> were determined {{as a function}} of operating voltage and filament material. For pure tungsten and thoria doped (1 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> crystal grain growth over the center portion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The development of notches associated with this grain growth is the cause of lamp burn out. Eventually, one of the notches will 'etch' through the filament, causing it to fail open. For rhenium doped (3 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> distortion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The lifetime of these lamps is about 1 year at an operating voltage of 5. 0 volts. The pure tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the longest average lifetime, and the thoria doped <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the shortest at 5. 0 volts. The lifetimes of these lamps is about 7 years at an operating voltage of 3. 5 volts. Data suggest that the rhenium doped lamps will have the longest average lifetime at 3. 5 volts, and the thoria doped will have the shortest. These lifetimes are comparable to the desired lifetimes of 7 years...|$|R

25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, {{the lifetime}} of a <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a {{tungsten}} <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type {{is often called}} Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.|$|E

It supplemented Case #1 and showed date order of the technology. In this case were [...] "stopper lamps" [...] which Mr. Edison made as early as 1880. These lamps were originally numbered 110 to 357. The [...] "stopper lamps" [...] were made by others like Westinghouse, Packard, and Greene. This type of electric light bulb had the filament stem built into the neck of the glass bulb. This was purposefully designed this way to circumvent the Edison patents. Many of these lamps were used by the Westinghouse Electric Company for lights at the World's Fair of Chicago in 1893. [...] They represented {{the state of the art}} in incandescent electric lights from others that worked closely with Edison to advance this technology.|$|E

2500|$|Although an {{inductive}} pulse {{makes it more}} likely that the lamp will start when the starter switch opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s. [...] Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170volts and 120watts. [...] The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.|$|E
2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{navigation}} aid on Cleveland Point was {{a beacon}} established in 1847, by Francis Edward Bigge, Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, at his expense, {{as part of}} his lobbying of Cleveland as the port for Moreton Bay. In the middle of the 19th century, small coastal steamboats became a main means of transport for farmers in Moreton Bay, specifically in Cleveland, Victoria Point, Redland Bay and along the Logan River and Albert River. Several lights were established around that period to assist navigation in Moreton Bay, notorious for its rocks and moving mudflats and sandbanks. In some places where no official light was established, locals would install their own lights, {{as was the case in}} Cleveland Point. In the 1860s the Government of Queensland decided to replace these lights with a permanent light. The first temporary government light was displayed in April 1864. The permanent light was constructed in late 1864 to early 1865. The original light source was a fixed kerosene operated light, visible for [...] In 1874 a refurbished Chance Brothers Fresnel lens from Comboyuro Point Light on Moreton Island replaced the original lens. The apparatus was upgraded to a more powerful Chance Brothers lens in 1879. Two red sectors, indicating close-by shoals were installed in 1920.
