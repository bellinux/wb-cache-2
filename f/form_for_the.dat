5|$|Innovations in Ottawa {{morphology}} {{contribute to}} differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes and word stems; {{the loss of}} final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes; a distinctive <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> verbal suffix indicating doubt; and a distinctive <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> verbal suffix indicating plurality on intransitive verbs with grammatically inanimate subjects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the name}} Strauss {{can be found}} in {{reference}} books frequently with “ß,” Strauss himself wrote his name with a long s and a round s (Strauſs), which was a replacement <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fraktur-ß used in antique manuscripts.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> walls {{consisted}} of towers, fronted with braced vertical sheets, 7.5 in thick, mounted on rails {{to allow the}} locks to be constructed in sections. A section of lock would be poured behind the form, {{and when it was}} set, the form would be moved to do the next section. Each of the twelve towers was 78 ft high by 36 ft wide. <b>The</b> <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> culverts were made of steel and were collapsible so they could be removed and moved along after each section of culvert had set. In all, there were 33 <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> centre and side-wall culverts, each 12 ft long, and 100 smaller <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lateral culverts.|$|R

5|$|After Link restores the Four Sword, Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle—the final dungeon in the game. Link fights Vaati {{just before}} he can drain Zelda {{of all of the}} Light Force hidden within her. Link defeats Vaati after {{engaging}} in a fight that consists of Vaati changing forms. When Link and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle, they meet Vaati as he again changes <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final battle of the game. After the battle, Ezlo returns to his original form. He finds the cap of wishes he created and gives it to Zelda, granting her a wish. The people cursed by Vaati are cured and the castle is turned back to normal. The hat overflows with the power of life and disappears. Ezlo gives Link a new hat and tells him that he enjoyed traveling with him, then leaves just as the door to the Minish world closes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E
5|$|Boarding was {{phased out}} in 1989 and the {{buildings}} used for boarding, School House and the Bishop's Palace, were converted into teaching space. Girls were {{admitted to the}} sixth <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in 1994, ending nearly 900 years of single-sex education. In 1999 the Daynes Sports Centre opened and the former gymnasium was converted into the Blake Drama Studio and two further laboratories. The same year the artists Cornford & Cross were commissioned by the Norwich Gallery to produce a series of sculptures beside the River Wensum. One of the works, Jerusalem, was installed on the school playing fields until July 2002. Part of the installation was later donated to the art department. In 2008 new science laboratories opened on St Faiths Lane in the south section of the Close. The facilities include a seismometer {{which is part of}} the British Geological Survey's schools network. That same year, the school began to admit girls below the sixth <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, initially as young as age eleven. The next year, 2009, all school-age girls were eligible for admission. An eighth house called Seagrim, named after distinguished ONs Derek and Hugh Seagrim, was created in 2009. In 2011 the first female head of school in the school's history was chosen. In late 2013 work began to extend the Lower School.|$|E

5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second half of the year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E
5|$|Doom was {{released}} to positive reception regarding the fast-paced gameplay, single-player campaign, visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that Doom {{was a successful}} return to <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on Metacritic. The {{final version of the}} game received very positive reviews from users on Steam. It also received praise from other video game creators, including Cliff Bleszinski and Greg Kasavin, who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.|$|E

5|$|Following the lukewarm {{response}} to the band's previous album, 2013's Super Collider, Dystopia received largely favorable reaction from critics, being considered a return to <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band. The album holds a Metacritic score of 69/100 as of August 2016. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, making Dystopia the band's second highest charting album in the U.S. after Countdown to Extinction, which peaked at number two in 1992. Additionally, the title track earned the band its first Grammy win (for Best Metal Performance) at the 59th Grammy Awards after eleven unsuccessful nominations.|$|E
5|$|He was {{in great}} <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction {{kept him from}} playing {{a part in the}} final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem. Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E

5|$|Irvine {{lost his}} place in the Burnley team after {{suffering}} a broken leg during a cup tie in 1967, and never properly regained his <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club. He was later transfer listed, and joined local rivals Preston North End in March 1968. In the Football League Second Division, he began to score goals again and was Preston's top goalscorer in the 1968–69 season despite suffering a serious leg injury which forced him to miss much of the campaign. When Alan Ball was named Preston manager in the summer of 1970, Irvine found himself out of the team. He joined Brighton & Hove Albion in July 1971 after impressing during a loan spell earlier in the year. He moved to Halifax Town midway through the 1972–73 season, but left the club after six months. Irvine ended his football career with a spell at semi-professional Great Harwood, before retiring at the age of 29.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Aztex {{attracted}} the attention of the Portland Timbers, a Major League Soccer expansion side for the 2011 season. At the end of the 2010 league season, Johnson was announced as one of the Timbers first four signings, along with Steve Cronin, Ryan Pore and Bright Dike. Because Portland had second draft pick behind fellow expansion side Vancouver Whitecaps, they announced they had previously signed Johnson, by taking him to their former USL side before the transfer deadline on 14 August and loaning him back to the Aztex {{for the remainder of the}} 2010 season. He was listed on the Timbers' roster as a forward. Johnson was a late substitute for Jorge Perlaza in the Timbers' first MLS home game and fourth in all, as they defeated Chicago Fire 4–2 on 15 April 2011.|$|E
