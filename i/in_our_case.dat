25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (<b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>case,</b> say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza {{were removed from}} the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, [...] "It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut". Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants. On his hiring, Tait said [...] "I am 6'5" [...] and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7" [...] and taller, and weighed over [...] When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants". In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2. Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said [...] "We came to feel that <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>case</b> 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the [...] "special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D". The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengerss director, Joss Whedon.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Oromandibular {{dyskinesia}} (OMD) {{can occur}} spontaneously {{or they can}} be induced by the conventional dopamine receptor antagonists. Anticholinergic me-dications have rarely been reported to cause OMD in parkinsonian or non-parkinsonian pa-tients. Methods: We analyzed the clinical features of two parkinsonian and one non-parkin-sonian patients who experienced OMD after anticholinergic medication. Results: Each pa-tient of <b>our</b> <b>cases</b> developed oromandibular symptoms in the temporal regions that {{were related to the}} addition of anticholinergic agents, and the symptoms were relieved following the discontinuation of the causative anticholinergic drugs. <b>In</b> one of <b>our</b> <b>case,</b> levodopa alone did not cause dyskinesia but augmented dyskinesia associated with anticholinergics. Con-clusions: Here we report two parkinsonian and one non-parkinsonian patients with OMD induced by the use of anticholinergic agents. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>cases,</b> we could not find any other precipi-tating or actual secondary causes for the OMD symptoms <b>in</b> <b>our</b> patients. Furthermore, the fact that the OMD <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>cases</b> were ameliorated with cessation of anticholinergics suggests that it may be anticholinergic-induced.

30|$|The {{storytelling}} evaluation {{pattern is}} similar to Bower’s (1970) organizational processes but with differences.

Instead, they tended to support more senior managers in collecting data and providing logic to support their boss’s opinion and help implement deals. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>cases,</b> initiation, integration, and structural context emerged at the top manager level.|$|R
