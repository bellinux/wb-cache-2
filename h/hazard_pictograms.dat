50|$|<b>Hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> {{form part}} of the {{international}} Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Two sets of pictograms are included within the GHS: one for the labelling of containers and for workplace hazard warnings, and a second for use during the transport of dangerous goods. Either {{one or the other}} is chosen, depending on the target audience, but the two are not used together. The two sets of pictograms use the same symbols for the same hazards, although certain symbols are not required for transport pictograms. Transport pictograms come in wider variety of colors and may contain additional information such as a subcategory number.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe safety {{data sheet}} (SDS), {{formerly}} known in the United States as the material {{safety data sheet}} (MSDS), contains important information for the safe handling of chemicals. This manuscript will cover the use of safety data sheets for process design and safe handling of chemicals. Three main categories (flammability, physical properties, and toxicity) listed in a SDS will be explained. Within each category, examples will be presented on how the specific information can be used in the design of safe chemical operations. Further, within the United States, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised their hazard communication standard in March of 2012. Specifically, the standard has been aligned with the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Changes include requirements for use of standardized signal words, <b>pictograms,</b> <b>hazard</b> statements, and precautionary statements. The presentation will review examples of these important changes, and relating these to the GHS for safe use of chemicals within the workplace worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Safety Data Sheet (hereinafter SDS) is a {{document}} that provides a mechanism for transfer of adequate safety information on hazardous substances and mixtures. SDS allows users to undertake the necessary measures to protect human health and safety {{in the workplace and}} environment. SDS is defined by the REACH Regulation (1907 / 2006 /EC), Annex II. By the implementation of REACH for substances and mixtures which are dangerous to {{human health and the environment}} the SDS has become an extended document that contains the Exposure scenario. It is necessary to prepare Exposure scenario for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of more than 10 t/y that have PBT and/or vPvB properties or are classified into some other class of hazard in accordance with Art. 14 of the REACH Regulation. Exposure scenario is part of the Chemical Safety Report, within the Chemical safety assessment as a part of registration dossier. Classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures is carried out in accordance with the CLP Regulation (1272 / 2008 /EC). CLP Regulation follows the criteria for classification of chemicals given by the UN, the so-called Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). Regulation brings new classification criteria, <b>hazard</b> symbols (<b>pictograms)</b> and warning labels and statements H and P by replacing R and S phrases. Both of regulations have a major impact on the content of SDS, which has become larger and more complex document for its creator (manufacturer) and the end user. We believe that the industry should take some steps to create a compendious version of SDS, which will have practical application in everyday life and will be convenient to the storekeeper, carriers, end users of dangerous chemicals, i. e. for people who are in a direct contact with dangerous chemicals in order to protect themselves timely and adequately from undesirable effects...|$|R
40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to better understand the}} effects of the use of signal words, pictograms, and performance based qualifiers test used in the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). This research improves the understanding of the following concepts: 1) the use of signal words and pictograms on Safety Data Sheets (SDS), 2) the presence of <b>hazard</b> and precautionary <b>pictograms</b> on GHS product labels, 3) the use of performance based qualifiers in GHS hazard and precautionary phrases, 4) the effects of signal words and pictograms on an individual’s perceived risk. The presence of signal words and pictograms on SDS suggests these items may provide potential benefits to users by improving the accuracy of their responses to survey items for physical hazards, but not the potential health hazards in this study. The presence of precautionary pictograms was significant in one of the two trials. Professionals correctly responded to a higher percentage of the survey items as compared to naïve users. The results also suggest there may be a speed versus accuracy tradeoff with the professionals taking longer to respond and correctly responding to a higher percentage of the survey items and the naïv...|$|R
5000|$|The GHS {{includes}} {{directions for}} {{application of the}} hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, pictogram, and hazard statement should be used. The GHS <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion. There has been discussion {{about the size of}} GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or [...] "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional {{to the size of the}} label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.|$|E

It must be noted here that <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> and list of ingredients are information sources for mixtures, not for articles (see Box 1). These results obtained in the present survey of ‘best-case’ participants are higher than in the survey with average European participants (66 % use safety instructions, 65 % warning symbols, 43 % packaging) [5].|$|E

30|$|An {{online survey}} {{investigated}} {{the awareness of}} 1030 consumers on harmful substances in everyday items. Participating consumers’ education level, knowledge in chemistry, and motivation were above society’s average. Although {{a large number of}} responses showed that survey participants were familiar with several aspects of the issue, the results revealed that knowledge in chemistry helped, but was not enough. Many participants assumed that products with an eco-label, natural personal care products, products without <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> or products produced in the European Union would not contain harmful substances. Most participants indicated to use <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> information on the packaging, reports in the media, and environmental and consumer organizations as information sources, while information by authorities and manufacturers were not named frequently and did not receive high confidence. Smartphone applications were not indicated by many participants as information sources. The information sources most trusted were environmental and consumer organizations, <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> and lists of ingredients on the containers. The declared confidence in certain risk communication instruments did not always correspond to the use frequencies indicated. Nearly all participants considered legislators as responsible for the reduction of harmful substances in consumer products.|$|E
30|$|For example, single {{substances}} and mixtures {{come under the}} CLP Regulation [1] and should be classified and labeled with <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> if they contain hazardous substances above the respective thresholds for labeling. However, there are many everyday products which may contain harmful substances, and the consumer is not informed about their presence by <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms.</b> For example, personal care products [17], food and pharmaceuticals are mixtures that are exempted from the CLP Regulation. Also articles (such as electronic products, textiles or articles of plastic materials) {{do not need to}} be labeled with <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> according to the CLP Regulation. Lists of ingredients are legally required on personal care products [18], washing and cleaning agents [19], pharmaceuticals, and prepackaged food. Even experts need time and knowledge to discern which of the ingredients in these lists are harmful for human health or the environment [4]. Ingredient lists are an important tool for toxicologists and dermatologists. However, patients who need to avoid specific allergens do not rely exclusively on ingredient labels. Surveys with patients suffering from fragrance allergy showed that the majority used the ingredient lists, but followed also ‘trial and error’ to find the products they could tolerate [20, 21]. Furthermore, there are various studies showing that the ingredient lists were not always correct [22 – 26].|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} study, {{we had found}} out that knowledge in chemistry helped, but was not enough. There were also participants with good knowledge in chemistry who made wrong assumptions, e.g., some of them assumed that products with an eco-label, natural personal care products, products without <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> or products produced in the European Union would not contain harmful substances [10].|$|E
3000|$|Around three {{quarters}} of the respondents considered information published by consumer and environmental organizations (75.4 %) and the <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> of the CLP Regulation (74.3 %) as trustworthy information (Fig.  2).

30|$|Cosmetic {{products}} {{need not}} be classified and labelled in accordance with CLP [53], even if they contain dangerous substances above the classification thresholds. In contrast, other consumer products, such as glue or varnish, are classified and labeled but not required to have the list of ingredients on their container labels. If, however, PCPs were classified and labelled {{in accordance with the}} CLP, many of them would require <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> on the label [26].|$|E
3000|$|... “The {{image of}} beauty and {{wellness}} that many consumers associate with cosmetics would be endangered when the mixtures are labelled as dangerous.” Probably not. Some consumers would certainly {{be surprised to see}} personal care products labelled as dangerous. However, consumers know about the deleterious effects of alcoholic beverages or cigarettes and they still consume these products. The general public has the right to be informed about the reality by correct <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms.</b>|$|E
40|$|Sweeping {{globalization}} {{has resulted in}} unparalleled economic growth, including increased international trade of hazardous chemicals. Fundamental differences between nations trading these materials, including language, literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from unintended chemical exposures. To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards, before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> were subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U. S. and Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the GHS pictograms that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their “original ” GHS counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the results of testing showed {{that only a small}} portion of the original GHS <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional systematic work is needed to develop GHS pictogram alternatives that effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience...|$|E
3000|$|... “Labelling {{would lead}} to a {{decrease}} in sales of personal care products.” Probably not. It is difficult to isolate labelling as one factor that would affect the sales numbers for a consumer product. E.g. there is no information whether sales of washing and cleansing products went down because of the labelling. Health warnings on tobacco products seem to have affected neither consumption nor sales. If cosmetic products were labelled, this might lead to a shift to products with less <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> and such an effect should be in everybody’s interest.|$|E
30|$|Lots of {{everyday}} products contain dangerous substances. The <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> and safety phrases on the containers of paints, varnishes, and washing and cleansing products depict {{the dangers of}} such a mixture of chemicals ([URL] There are also recommendations for safe handling on the container which help you to reduce your personal risk when dealing with the product and to avoid damage to the environment. Ingredients are listed on the containers/packaging of personal care products and washing and cleansing products. In contrast to that, there is no legal obligation that other products such as electronic appliances, plastic products, or furniture have to be labeled {{with regard to their}} content of substances harmful to human health or the environment.|$|E
30|$|Risk {{communication}} provisions, such as <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> on {{the product}} containers, are established to aid consumers and workers {{to be aware of}} hazards and to implement a suitable risk management behavior so as to minimize exposure and hence risk. The understanding of the risk communication message by the recipients is one of the basic pillars of chemical legislation [2]. Risk communication is an important first step, but there are various indications that risk communication measures are not always as effective as intended, because they are not always understood in the way expected by the decision makers and are thus not sufficiently protective under the consumer and the environmental perspectives. Previous studies that evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of risk communication yielded remarkable results: A large number of users in European and non-European countries struggled to understand ingredient lists and labels [3, 4]. Other studies analyzed the understanding of <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> and showed that end-users did not understand the signs correctly [5, 6]. Even correctly understood risk information did not necessarily lead to the intended risk reduction behaviors [5]. It was also described that illiterate persons had great difficulty to understand pictorial label information and safety instructions [6]. A European survey [7] where citizens should indicate whether they thought that certain products contained ‘chemical substances’ in general showed that it is also worthwhile to ask very simple and basic questions which do not require any previous knowledge. Participants of this survey were not asked about harmful substances but only about chemical ingredients. For a chemist the results of this survey were shocking because large numbers of participants in some EU member countries assumed that products like cleaning products (up to 9 % of the participants in one EU member country), paint (up to 10 %), electronic appliances (up to 37 %), or furniture (up to 38 %) would not contain chemical substances at all. Such results suggest that these citizens might have problems understanding risk communication tools. However, it is not certain that experts judge risks correctly [8, 9].|$|E
30|$|Apart from <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> or the {{ingredient}} lists, legally required {{information on the}} packaging are, for example, labels for electric and electronic articles [27]. The construction products Regulation [28] foresees an indication of substances of very high concern in the declaration of performance for construction products. Furthermore, harmful chemicals are regulated in the toy safety Directive [29], in the Directive regarding medical devices [30], in the Directive regarding active implantable medical devices [31], in the Directive regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices [32], and in the packaging Directive [33]. Toys for children usually fulfill stricter criteria concerning harmful substances than most other articles, {{but they are not}} necessarily free of them [29]. Products for children like textiles or personal care products are not liable to fulfill stricter standards compared to products for adults, and hence they can contain harmful substances. There are legal provisions for medical devices [30 – 32]; however, they might contain harmful substances at higher concentrations compared to everyday products, because their applications are often exempted from the REACH [34] and CLP provisions.|$|E
30|$|A {{surprisingly}} strong bias was observed: Three {{quarters of}} the survey participants trusted in information provided by NGOs, while only around {{a third of them}} had confidence in authorities and only a sixth trusted manufacturers (Fig.  2). Most survey participants did not choose answers where authorities or manufacturers were explicitly named in the offered response options, although these stakeholders should have the best knowledge of harmful substances in products. This might be interpreted by a lack of confidence in authorities and manufacturers. Another possibility is, that persons who provided these answers presumed a higher effort to actively ask these stakeholders for the desired information and assumed a lower chance to receive useful and understandable information (e.g., [62]). It is also possible that the rather low confidence in authorities and manufacturers {{is one of the reasons}} for the high personal interest and private engagement of the study participants. The low appreciation of authorities and manufacturers is in contradiction with the fact, that concrete legally requested information by manufacturers on the products (such as <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> ingredient lists, and information on the package) were very welcome by the majority of survey participants as information sources (Fig.  2). Apparently, many survey participants were not aware of the roles of manufacturers and did not consider that authorities establish and enforce such obligations.|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{erroneous}} {{assumptions and}} misconceptions {{of the respondents}} must be regarded as dangerous as they thwart a decent safety behavior. This {{is especially true for}} persons who assumed that products manufactured in the European Union, products without <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> natural pharmaceuticals, natural personal care products, homeopathic products or products with an eco-label would be free of harmful substances. There seems to be a lack of awareness of chemical risks even in motivated informed consumers. This results in a subjective feeling of security, which is actually pseudo safety due to insufficient understanding. Given that three out of four respondents postulate that consumers take over the responsibility for minimizing harmful substances in consumer products, this result is rather alarming. It remains unclear how end-users should bear responsibility and reduce the risk posed by harmful substances {{as long as they do}} not have the knowledge to make sufficiently informed choices. Avoidance is the favored risk reduction strategy chosen by the majority of the study participants (see answers b and c in Fig.  3), which is a useful general strategy for consumers. Reading the description and instructions on the packaging (see Fig.  3 answers d and e) is only helpful if this leads to the recommended safety behavior. Reading alone does not reduce risk. Also small doses of very toxic substances can lead to severe deleterious effects. Disposal of the product after use according to instructions (see Fig.  3 answer a) is certainly a good way of reducing environmental exposure, but this is not sufficient for products which are discharged via the waste water after use such as washing and cleaning agents, rinse off personal care products or products directly discharged into the environment such as pesticides.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN-GHS) is {{developed}} to harmonize {{the criteria for}} hazard communication worldwide. The European Regulation on classification, labeling, and packaging of substances and mixtures [CLP Regulation (European Commission, EC) No 1272 / 2008] will align the existing European Union (EU) legislation to the UN-GHS. This CLP Regulation entered into force on January 20, 2009, and will, after a transitional period, replace the current rules on classification, labeling, and packaging for supply and use in Europe. Both old and new classifications will exist simultaneously until 2010 for substances and until 2015 for mixtures. Hazard classification. The new hazard classification will introduce new health hazard classes and categories, with associated new <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms,</b> signal words, Hazard (H) -statements, and Precautionary (P) -statements as labeling elements. Furthermore, the CLP Regulation will affect the notification of product information on hazardous products to poisons information centers (PICs). Product notification procedures. At this moment product notification widely varies in procedures and requirements across EU Member States. Article 45 of the CLP Regulation contains a provision stating that the EC will (by January 20, 2012) review the possibility of harmonizing product notification. The European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) is recognized as an important stakeholder. For cosmetic products, the new Cosmetics Regulation will directly implement a new procedure for electronic cosmetic product notification in all EU Member States. Conclusion. Both the CLP Regulation and the Cosmetics Regulation will develop their own product notification procedure within different time frames. Harmonization of notification procedures for both product groups, especially a common electronic format, would be most effective from a cost-benefit viewpoint and would be welcomed by PICs...|$|E
30|$|Many {{consumers}} consider {{natural products}} {{as an alternative}} with a benefit for their healthy lifestyle and grant them a bonus as ‘greener’ or ‘safer’ compared to conventional products. There is also a new trend that consumers tend to avoid certain compounds in products [1], e.g. parabens, endocrine disruptors such as phthalates ([URL] or fragrances [2, 3]. There are {{products on the market}} that tout with labels that they are free of these ingredients and in addition free of preservatives, PEG emulsifiers, paraffin, mineral oil, silicon, or micro plastic material. Consumers might assume that these personal care products contain less chemicals of concern, although they usually do not know the properties and concentrations of the ingredients. Many consumers are not aware that the allergenic potential of the fragrance ingredients of these products might not be smaller. These market trends reflect the concern of consumers about dangerous ingredients in personal care products and the difficulty for them to make the right choice [4]. Consumers might be misled about the product safety from the attractive containers, appealing messages promised by the cosmetic industry and the lack of warning symbols [5 – 7]. These messages tend to make consumers trust the products and make them less aware that they might contain dangerous substances. There are no warning symbols on personal care products, because they are exempt from the obligation to classify and label products that contain hazardous substances above the thresholds for classification [8]. If, however, PCPs were classified and labelled in accordance with the criteria of the European regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP-regulation [8]), many of them would require <b>hazard</b> <b>pictograms</b> on the label [9]. Consumers can use other information sources, such as the ingredient lists, which have to be printed on the containers of personal care products according to the European cosmetics regulation [10]. Most natural substances can be recognized in these lists by the binomial Latin names of the organism of origin, e.g. Rosa damascena extract is an extract of the Damask rose. The Latin names {{do not need to be}} complemented by common names. Names like Rosa (rose), Lavandula (lavender) or Rosmarinus (rosemary) are similar to the common names and easily understood, whereas Urtica urens (stinging nettle), Prunus armeniaca (apricot) or Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) are probably not familiar to most of the consumers, just like the names of most chemically synthesized ingredients. Some authors consider the use of natural substances as ingredients in personal care products since antiquity as unspoken indication for their safety [11]. However, the traditional use of chemicals does not guarantee that they are safe. Some examples of toxic substances, which were used in the past or have been used for a long time, are lead salts, antimony and copper (as ingredients in decorative cosmetics in Ancient Egypt) or henna (as skin and hair dye). Many natural substances that are employed in personal care products are classified as hazardous substances according to the CLP-regulation [8]. A recent study showed that out of 1358 natural substances in the ‘International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients’ (INCI list or Common Ingredients Glossary [12]) 369 natural substances are classified as hazardous substances [13]. 257 substances are classified due to their negative effects on human health (226 due to their effects on skin and eyes), and 182 substances are classified due to their negative effects on the aquatic environment. 53 natural substances in the INCI list are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and substances toxic to reproduction. The point of departure of the present study was to find out whether these substances were really used in so-called natural personal care products in today’s retail market in Europe.|$|E
