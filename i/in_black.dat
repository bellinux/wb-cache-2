40|$|The stimulatory {{effects of}} {{isoprenaline}} on human lymphocytic cyclic AMP (cAMP) and blockade by propranolol were studied in vitro <b>in</b> healthy <b>Black</b> and White volunteers. Basal levels of lymphocytic cAMP {{were significantly higher}} <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> than <b>in</b> Whites. Stimulation with isoprenaline caused a dose-related increase in cAMP, which was in concentrations of 10 (- 9) to 10 (- 5) M significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> than <b>in</b> Whites. Blockade by 10 (- 4) M propranolol did not affect basal cAMP levels significantly, but increases in cAMP levels were significantly smaller in both groups after 10 (- 9) to 10 (- 2) M isoprenaline, while differences between cAMP levels <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> and Whites were still significant at concentrations 10 (- 9) to 10 (- 3) M. The increased cAMP concentration <b>in</b> lymphocytes of <b>Blacks</b> probably reflects {{a higher degree of}} beta 2 -adrenoceptor activity which could be due to either a greater number and/or greater sensitivity of lymphocytic beta 2 -adrenoceptors <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> than <b>in</b> Whites...|$|R
40|$|The {{serum and urinary}} calcium, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD), 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3), and {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) were studied <b>in</b> healthy <b>black</b> and white males living in Belgium, {{and the results were}} compared to data <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> of similar age living in Zaïre. Dietary calcium and vitamin D were estimated in a sub-sample of blacks and whites examined in Belgium. Compared to whites (9. 51 +/- 0. 28 mg%) serum calcium was somewhat lower <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> (9. 26 +/- 0. 27 mg% in Belgium; 9. 19 +/- 0. 48 mg% in Zaïre). The 24 hour urinary calcium excretion averaged 215. 0 +/- 16. 7 mg% in whites and was higher (P less than 0. 05 or less) than <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> (115 +/- 71 mg% in Belgium; 36 +/- 33 mg% in Zaïre). The serum 25 OHD levels were similar <b>in</b> whites and <b>blacks</b> evaluated <b>in</b> Zaïre, both being higher (P less than 0. 05 or less) than <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> living <b>in</b> Belgium. <b>In</b> the latter <b>blacks,</b> an inverse correlation was observed between the 25 OHD level and the duration of the stay in a temperate climate. Parathyroid hormone levels were slightly higher <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> living <b>in</b> Belgium than in the other two groups of subjects. The serum levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and human vitamin D-binding protein were similar in the three groups of subjects. Dietary calcium averaged 541 +/- 152 mg/day <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> and was significantly (P less than 0. 001) less than in whites (1, 203 +/- 508 mg/day), whereas no significant difference was observed in dietary vitamin D intake between blacks and whites.

40|$|Background—On {{the basis}} of studies with limited {{statistical}} power, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] is not considered {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) <b>in</b> <b>blacks.</b> We evaluated associations between Lp(a) and incident CVD events <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites <b>in</b> the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Methods and Results—Plasma Lp(a) was measured <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> (n 3467) and whites (n 9851). Hazards ratios (HRs) for incident CVD events (coronary heart disease and ischemic strokes) were calculated. Lp(a) levels were higher with wider interindividual variation <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> (median [interquartile range], 12. 8 [7. 1 – 21. 7] mg/dL) than whites (4. 3 [1. 7 – 9. 5] mg/dL; P 0. 0001). At 20 years of follow-up, 676 CVD events occurred <b>in</b> <b>blacks,</b> and 1821 events occurred in whites. Adjusted HRs (95 % confidence interval) per race-specific 1 -SD–greater log-transformed Lp(a) were 1. 13 (1. 04 – 1. 23) for incident CVD, 1. 11 (1. 00 – 1. 22) for incident coronary heart disease, and 1. 21 (1. 06 – 1. 39) for ischemic strokes <b>in</b> <b>blacks.</b> For whites, the respective HRs (95 % confidence intervals) were 1. 09 (1. 04 – 1. 15), 1. 10 (1. 05 – 1. 16), and 1. 07 (0. 97 – 1. 19). Quintile analyses showed that risk for incident CVD was graded but statistically significant only for the highest compared with the lowest quintile (HR [95 % confidence interval], 1. 35 [1. 06 – 1. 74] for blacks and 1. 27 [1. 10 – 1. 47] for whites). Similar results were obtained with the use of Lp(a) cutoffs of 10 mg/dL, 10 to 20 mg/dL, 20 to 30 mg/dL, and 30 mg/dL. Conclusions—Lp(a) levels were positively associated with CVD events. Associations were at least as strong, with a larger range of Lp(a) concentrations, <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> compared with whites. (Circulation. 2012; 125 : 241 - 249. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Glaucoma {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{blindness}} worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma and has a particularly devastating impact <b>in</b> <b>blacks.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>black</b> American population, POAG prevalence is estimated to be six times as high in certain age groups compared to whites. POAG is more likely to result in irreversible blindness, appears approximately 10 years earlier and progresses more rapidly <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> than <b>in</b> whites. Racial differences in optic disk parameters have been reported and show that blacks have larger optic disks than whites. This finding is robust and may account for the reported differences in other optic disk parameters. The existence of racial differences in intraocular pressure remains to be demonstrated, as conflicting findings are reported in the literature. Intraocular pressure may actually be underestimated <b>in</b> <b>blacks,</b> perhaps because they have thinner corneas. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension is higher <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> than <b>in</b> whites, and although no causal relationship has been established between POAG and each of these systemic diseases, some reports suggest that they often occur together, perhaps through an indirect relationship with intraocular pressure. Compounding the problem, there is evidence that blacks are less responsive to both drug and surgical treatment for POAG. Finally, they often have reduced accessibility to treatment and are less aware of the risks of having POAG. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge pertaining to POAG <b>in</b> <b>blacks.</b> (Surv Ophthalmo...|$|R
