5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welding),</b> magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welding</b> in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance.

40|$|Abstract. Friction {{and wear}} {{behaviors}} {{have been studied}} between the untreated base material and the <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welds</b> of 5052 aluminum alloy. To determine the wear mechanism surface microstructures of worn test samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Variation rule of wear-resistance property and coefficient of friction were investigated according to wear mass loss and moment of friction under different parameter condition. The results show that all of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welds</b> had lower coefficients of friction and higher wear resistance than base material. The abrasion loss of base material increased by six times when position pressure increased from 50 N to 100 N and the abrasion loss is as 10 - 20 times as that of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welds.</b> The value of friction-moment of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welds</b> is low and stable and abrasion principle had changed from grain abrasion to fatigue wear.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of tool rotation speed and feed rate on the forming limit of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> Al 6061 -T 651 sheets has been investigated. The forming limit curve was evaluated by limit dome height test performed on all the <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> sheets. The welding trials were conducted at a tool rotation speed of 1300 and 1400 r/min and feed rate of 90 and 100 mm/min. A third trial of welding was performed at a rotational speed of 1500 r/min and feed rate 120 mm/min. It is found that with increase in the tool rotation speed, from 1300 to 1400 r/min, for a constant feed rate, the forming limit of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> blank has improved and with increase in feed rate, from 90 to 100 mm/min, for a constant tool rotation speed, it has decreased. The forming limit of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> sheets is better than unwelded sheets. The thickness gradient after forming is severe {{in the cases of}} <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> blanks made at higher feed rate and lower rotation speed. The strain hardening exponent of weld (n) increases with increase in tool rotation speed and it decreases with increase in feed rate. It has been demonstrated that the change in the forming limit of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> sheets with respect to welding parameters is due to the thickness distribution severity and strain hardening exponent of the weld region during forming. There is not much variation in the dome height among the <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> sheets tested. When compared with unwelded sheets, dome height of <b>friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welded</b> sheets is higher in near-plane-strain condition, but it is lesser in stretching strain paths...|$|R

25|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>stir</b> <b>welding</b> (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} joining {{process that}} uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material.
