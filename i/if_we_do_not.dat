25|$|We hate {{poetry that}} has a palpable design upon us—and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> agree, seems to put its hand in its {{breeches}} pocket. Poetry should be great & unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that reason}} alone cannot {{determine}} whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know {{the outcome of}} this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand the physics involved.|$|E
50|$|Premise Fourteen: From birth on, we are {{individually}} and collectively enculturated to hate life, hate the natural world, hate the wild, hate wild animals, hate women, hate children, hate our bodies, hate and fear our emotions, hate ourselves. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hate the world, we could not {{allow it to be}} destroyed before our eyes. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hate ourselves, <b>we</b> could not allow our homes—and our bodies—to be poisoned.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2013, Aymond {{issued a}} {{statement}} of regret that his predecessor, Archbishop Philip Hannan, and the local church leadership ignored the arson attack on a local gay bar that killed 32 people 40 years earlier. Aymond wrote to Time magazine that [...] "In retrospect, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> release a statement we should {{have to be in}} solidarity with the victims and their families.... The church <b>does</b> <b>not</b> condone violence and hatred. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> extend our care and condolences, I deeply apologize.|$|R
25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> return the fish to the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know exactly {{what is going to}} come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, {{noting the}} 40th {{anniversary of the}} fire, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Michael Aymond, issued a {{statement}} of regret that his predecessor, Archbishop Philip Hannan, and the local church leadership ignored the arson attack. Aymond wrote to Time magazine that [...] "In retrospect, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> release a statement we should {{have to be in}} solidarity with the victims and their families ...

25|$|Satisfactory {{as it may}} be to note {{his general}} {{acceptance}} for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. I have {{on more than one occasion}} brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} this objection, some utilitarians have {{put forward a}} [...] "radical proposal"; {{although}} they accept utilitarianism as the correct moral theory, {{it would be more}} beneficial <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> proclaim this fact, and keep it a well-guarded secret. [...] "Utilitarianism would then become an esoteric doctrine, accepted by only a few philosophers who would, if challenged, deny its existence in public.". This form of Utilitarianism (commonly named as Government House utilitarianism), whilst having historically held traction (Mill's publications being in the 19th century), no longer presents such a convincing case in light of modern education levels and opportunities.|$|E

500|$|Changes {{brought on}} by the {{exponential}} growth of human population (at the time of the book's publication, over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years) and the worldwide scale of resource consumption, have altered the picture, however. [...] Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed (since the 1980s) nature's capacity for regeneration. [...] We are now using more than 125% of nature's yearly output. [...] "If civilization is to survive, it must live on the interest, not the capital of nature" [...] (129). [...] He concludes that [...] "now is our chance to get the future right"—the collapse of human civilization is imminent <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> act now to prevent it (132).|$|E
500|$|The siege was {{continued}} for some months longer, {{but in the}} spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted. [...] The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King George III warned that it would be the source [...] "of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity" [...] and expressed his wish [...] "if possible to be rid of Gibraltar... I shall not think peace complete <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> get rid of Gibraltar." [...] General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, [...] "a sort of cult status". The British public acquired [...] "an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place." [...] The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as [...] "strong as the Rock of Gibraltar".|$|E
500|$|Before {{midnight on}} 22 November, the rebels sent a {{telegraph}} to the president, reading [...] "We {{do not want}} the return of the chibata [...] This we ask the President of the republic and the Minister of the Navy. We want an immediate response. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> receive such a response, we will destroy the city and the ships that are not revolting." [...] Fonseca, however, refused to allow any direct contact between himself and the mutineers. Instead, the rebel force moved to Ilha do Viana at 1am on 23 November to coal and take on supplies to guard against the possibility of an extended siege. After the sun rose, the bodies of the dead sailors from Minas Geraes were sent on a launch to Ilha das Cobras, along with a letter from João Cândido Felisberto—who was in command of the rebel armada—and his fellow sailors to the Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca, the nephew of the first president who had been in office for only one week. It included a demand {{for the end of the}} 'slavery' being practiced by the navy—most notably the continued use of the lash despite its ban in every other Western nation: ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996 Frank co-sponsored the [...] "Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act" [...] (H.R.4111. Became Public Law No: 104-238.) [...] "to provide {{educational}} {{assistance to}} the dependents of Federal law enforcement officials who are killed or disabled {{in the performance of}} their duties." [...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually wanted to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} this one must avoid quantum anomalies at all cost, because <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{there will be}} restrictions on the physical Hilbert space that have no counterpart in the classical theory, implying that the quantum theory has fewer degrees of freedom than the classical theory.|$|E
60|$|True, once I {{ventured to}} ask my {{companion}} where he thought we were going, to which he replied, much to my surprise, that he didn't know and didn't care; that it was quite certain <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> go forward <b>we</b> could not expect to get on, {{and that in the}} ordinary course of things <b>if</b> <b>we</b> proceeded we should undoubtedly come to something. To this I replied, in a meditative tone, that there was much truth in the observation, and that, at any rate, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> come to something, something would certainly come to us.|$|R
