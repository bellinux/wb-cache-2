25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proto-oncogene}} is {{a normal}} gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's lymphoma, which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> within {{the vicinity of the}} MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. (More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below) ...|$|E

The transcriptional enhancement requires the presence of <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> in cis and also of a common factor interacting in trans with all three <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences.</b> Interestingly, first experiments indicate the additional presence of cellular factors in T-cell and most prominently in HeLa cell extracts which can reduce the enhancer activity of C mu and LPV...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{transcriptional}} activity of retroviral <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> in hematopoietic lineages, we determined {{the effect of}} <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> on {{the expression of the}} neomycin resistance gene transferred by two retroviral vectors to primary hematopoietic lineages. We constructed the vector pFr-SV(X). The Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer region of a vector, pZIP-SV(X), was replaced by a 380 -nucleotide-long fragment containing the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> of the Friend murine leukemia virus. The <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> of Friend murine leukemia virus were used because these sequences have been shown to target the disease specificity of the virus to the erythroid lineage. Hematopoietic progenitors in murine continuous marrow cultures were infected with identical numbers of pure defective, infectious viral vector particles of either pFr-SV(X) or pZIP-SV(X). Expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene in multipotential stem cells and their differentiated progeny was assayed as the ability of infected progenitors to form colonies (greater than 50 cells) in G 418. Expression of the neomycin resistance gene in multipotential progenitor cells during the entire 11 weeks of the cultures was independent of the vector used to transfer the gene. Conversely, committed hemoglobinized erythroid bursts and myeloid colonies resistant to G 418 were consistently produced by pFr-SV(X) -infected cultures but not pZIP-SV(X) -infected cultures. These results demonstrate that both pFr-SV(X) and pZIP-SV(X) were stably integrated and expressed in more primitive, multilineage, hematopoietic progenitor cells and suggest that the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> of a vector affects expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene when these cells differentiate to committed myeloid and erythroid cells...|$|R
40|$|Oncogenic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) viruses, such as MCF 247, show a {{positive}} correlation between the ability to replicate efficiently in the thymus and a leukemogenic phenotype. Other MCF viruses, such as MCF 30 - 2, replicate to high titers in thymocytes and do not accelerate the onset of leukemia. We used these two MCF viruses with different biological phenotypes to distinguish the effect of specific viral genes and genetic determinants on thymotropism and leukemogenicity. Our goal was to identify the viral sequences that distinguish thymotropic, nonleukemogenic viruses such as MCF 30 - 2 from thymotropic, leukemogenic viruses such as MCF 247. We cloned MCF 30 - 2, compared the genetic hallmarks of MCF 30 - 2 with those of MCF 247, constructed a series of recombinants, and tested the ability of recombinant viruses to replicate in the thymus and to induce leukemia. The results established that (i) MCF 30 - 2 and MCF 247 differ in the numbers of copies of the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> in the long terminal repeats. (ii) The thymotropic phenotype of both viruses is independent of the number of copies of the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences.</b> (iii) The oncogenic phenotype of MCF 247 is correlated with the presence in the virus of duplicated <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> or with the presence of an enhancer with a specific sequence. These results show that the pathogenic phenotypes of MCF viruses are dissociable from the thymotropic phenotype and depend, at least in part, upon the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences.</b> On the basis of these results, we suggest that the molecular mechanisms by which the <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> determine thymotropism are different from those that determine oncogenicity...|$|R

50|$|The {{conservative}} {{nature of}} gene deserts confirms that these stretches of noncoding bases {{are essential to}} proper functioning. Indeed, {{a wide range of}} studies on irregularities in the noncoding genes discovered several associations to genetic diseases. One of the most studied gene deserts is the 8q24 region. Early genome wide association studies were focused on the 8q24 region (residing on chromosome 8) due to the abnormally high rates of SNPs that seem to occur in the region. These studies found that the region was linked to increased risks for a variety of cancers, notably in the prostate, breast, ovaries, colonic, and pancreas. Using inserts of the gene desert into bacterial artificial chromosomes, one study was able to produce enhancer activity in certain regions, which were isolated via cloning systems. This study successfully identified an <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> hidden in the region. Within this <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence,</b> an SNP that conferred risk for prostate cancer, labeled SNP s6983267, was discovered in diseased mice. However, the 8q24 region is not solely limited to conferred risks of prostate cancer. A study in 2008 screened human subjects (and controls) with variations in the gene desert region, discovering five different regions that conferred different risks when affected by different SNPs. This study used identified SNP markers in the gene desert to identify risk conference from each of the regions to a specific tissue expression. Although these risks were successfully linked to various forms of cancer, Ghoussaini, M., et al. note their uncertainty in whether the SNPs functioned merely as markers or were the direct causants of the cancers.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, Hardin, with Haiping Hao and David Allen, {{analyzed}} {{the sequence of}} the per gene in Drosophila and found a 69-bp enhancer upstream of the gene. This <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> contained an E-box (CACGTG), which {{was determined to be}} necessary for high-level per transcription. As E-boxes are typically bound by proteins containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein structural motif, the presence of an E-box in per led to the hypothesis that the proteins involved in circadian rhythms may contain a bHLH domain. This proved to be vital in establishing the function of the previously discovered CLOCK protein, which was known {{to play a role in}} circadian rhythms and contained a bHLH domain as well. This discovery also aided in the identification of the BMAL1 and CYCLE proteins as critical players in the circadian rhythms of mammalian and Drosophila circadian systems respectively.|$|E
5000|$|SOX-9 {{also plays}} {{a pivotal role in}} male sexual development; by working with Sf1, SOX-9 can produce AMH in Sertoli cells to inhibit the {{creation}} of a female reproductive system. It also interacts with a few other genes to promote the development of male sexual organs. The process starts when the transcription factor Testis determining factor (encoded by the sex-determining region SRY of the Y chromosome) activates SOX-9 activity by binding to an <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> upstream of the gene. Next, Sox9 activates FGF9 and forms feedforward loops with FGF9 and PGD2. [...] These loops are important for producing SOX-9; without these loops, SOX-9 would run out {{and the development of a}} female would almost certainly ensue. Activation of FGF9 by SOX-9 starts vital processes in male development, such as the creation of testis cords and the multiplication of Sertoli cells. The association of SOX-9 and Dax1 actually creates Sertoli cells, another vital process in male development.|$|E
50|$|The {{detection}} of eRNAs is fairly recent (2010) {{and has been}} made possible {{through the use of}} genome-wide investigation techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq). RNA-seq permits the direct identification of eRNAs by matching the detected transcript to the corresponding <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> through bioinformatic analyses. ChIP-seq represents a less direct way to assess enhancer transcription but can also provide crucial information as specific chromatin marks are associated with active enhancers. Although some data remain controversial, the consensus in the literature is that the best combination of histone post-translational modifications at active enhancers is made of H2AZ, H3K27ac, and a high ratio of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3. ChIP experiments can also be conducted with antibodies that recognize RNA Pol II, which can be found at sites of active transcription. The experimental {{detection of}} eRNAs is complicated by their low endogenous stability conferred by exosome degradation and nonsense-mediated decay. Nonetheless, the fact that eRNAs tend to be expressed from active enhancers might make their detection a useful tool to distinguish between active and inactive enhancers.|$|E

40|$|Oncogenic avian retroviruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and the avian {{leukosis}} viruses, contain a strong enhancer in the U 3 {{portion of the}} proviral long terminal repeat (LTR). The LTRs of a second class of avian retroviruses, the endogenous viruses (ev) lack detectable enhancer activity. By creating ev-RSV hybrid LTRs, we previously demonstrated that, {{despite the lack of}} independent enhancer activity in the ev U 3 region, ev LTRs contain sequences that are able to functionally replace essential enhancer domains from the RSV enhancer. A hypothesis proposed to explain these data was that ev LTRs contain a partial <b>enhancer</b> that includes <b>sequences</b> necessary but not sufficient for enhancer activity and that these sequences were complemented by RSV enhancer domains present in the original hybrid constructs to generate a functional enhancer. Studies described in this report were designed to define sequences from both the ev and RSV LTRs required to generate this composite enhancer.

50|$|Recent {{work has}} {{investigated}} {{the role of}} enhancers in morphological changes in threespine stickleback fish. Sticklebacks exist in both marine and freshwater environments, but sticklebacks in many freshwater populations have completely lost their pelvic fins (appendages homologous to the posterior limb of tetrapods). Pitx1 is a homeobox gene involved in posterior limb development in vertebrates. Preliminary genetic analyses indicated that changes in the expression of this gene were responsible for pelvic reduction in sticklebacks. Fish expressing only the freshwater allele of Pitx1 do not have pelvic spines, whereas fish expressing a marine allele retain pelvic spines. A more thorough characterization showed that a 500 base pair <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> is responsible for turning on Pitx1 expression in the posterior fin bud. This enhancer is located near a chromosomal fragile site—a sequence of DNA {{that is likely to}} be broken and thus more likely to be mutated as a result of imprecise DNA repair.

50|$|The enhancers {{determining}} early segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos {{are among}} the best characterized developmental enhancers. In the early fly embryo, the gap gene transcription factors are responsible for activating and repressing a number of segmentation genes, such as the pair rule genes. The gap genes are expressed in blocks along the anterior-posterior axis of the fly along with other maternal effect transcription factors, thus creating zones within which different combinations of transcription factors are expressed. The pair-rule genes are separated from one another by non-expressing cells. Moreover, the stripes of expression for different pair-rule genes are offset by a few cell diameters from one another. Thus, unique combinations of pair-rule gene expression create spatial domains along the anterior-posterior axis to set up each of the 14 individual segments. The 480 bp enhancer responsible for driving the sharp stripe two of the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) has been well-characterized. The enhancer contains 12 different binding sites for maternal and gap gene transcription factors. Activating and repressing sites overlap in sequence. Eve is only expressed in a narrow stripe of cells that contain high concentrations of the activators and low concentration of the repressors for this <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence.</b> Other enhancer regions drive eve expression in 6 other stripes in the embryo.|$|E

Skipping of a target dystrophin exon during splicing with antisense oligonucleotides is attracting much attention as the most plausible way to express dystrophin in DMD. Antisense oligonucleotides have been designed against splicing regulatory sequences such as splicing <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> of target exons. Recently, we reported that a chemical kinase inhibitor specifically enhances the skipping of mutated dystrophin exon 31, indicating the existence of exon-specific splicing regulatory systems. However, the basis for such individual regulatory systems is largely unknown. Here, we categorized the dystrophin exons {{in terms of their}} splicing regulatory factors. Results Using a computer-based machine learning system, we first constructed a decision tree separating 77 authentic from 14 known cryptic exons using 25 indexes of splicing regulatory factors as decision markers. We evaluated the classification accuracy of a novel cryptic exon (exon 11 a) identified in this study. However, the tree mislabeled exon 11 a as a true exon. Therefore, we re-constructed the decision tree to separate all 15 cryptic exons. The revised decision tree categorized the 77 authentic exons into five groups. Furthermore, all nine disease-associated novel exons were successfully categorized as exons, validating the decision tree. One group, consisting of 30 exons, was characterized by a high density of exonic splicing <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences.</b> This suggests that AOs targeting splicing <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> would efficiently induce skipping of exons belonging to this group.

In this study, we examined whether these <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence</b> alterations can also affect polyomavirus replication during the persistent phase of infection in vivo. After infection of newborn mice {{with a mixture of}} three enhancer variants, the individual organs could select for enhancer-specific viral DNA replication during both the acute and the persistent phases of infection. Contrary to expectations, the ability of some variants to establish a high-level acute infection in some organs (e. g., the pancreas) did not necessarily lead to a persistent infection in those organs. Thus, enhancers can affect acute and persistent infections differently. In addition, some enhancer variants tended to establish a high-level persistent infection in the kidneys immediately following an acute infection; however, in all cases considerable histopathology was associated with these elevated long-term infections, and these mice were always runty. A persistent infection in the kidneys thus appears able to exist in two distinguishable states, a high-level pathological state and a low-level nonpathological state, which can be affected by the viral <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E

Functional splicing enhancers were then selected by multiple rounds of in vitro splicing in nuclear extracts, reverse transcription, and selective PCR amplification of the spliced products.

Evidence to date shows that of the 110,000 gene <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences</b> identified in the human genome, HACNS1 has undergone the most change during the human evolution since the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor.|$|R
40|$|Abundant {{evidence}} indicates that developmental evolution, the foundation of morphological evolution, is based on changes in gene function. Over the past decade a consensus has developed that transcriptional regulation, acting through <b>enhancer</b> <b>sequences,</b> is the primary level of evolutionary significant change. Here we propose that other regulatory levels are probably as important as enhancers in developmental evolution. We also explain why these alternative regulatory levels might have been neglected, and briefly discuss ways to test our hypothesis...|$|R
