5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR.

Generally, <b>for</b> <b>specific</b> inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E
