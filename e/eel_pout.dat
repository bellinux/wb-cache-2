50|$|Every February, Leech Lake {{is home to}} the International Eelpout Festival. The <b>eel</b> <b>pout,</b> {{also known}} as the Burbot, is rarely seen in Leech Lake, except in the winter when it is very plentiful. Events include a black-tie dinner, ice bowling, and a contest to see who can catch the largest <b>eel</b> <b>pout.</b>|$|E
40|$|Data from bottom-trawl {{surveys in}} the Labrador-Newfoundland area during 1978 - 80 {{were used to}} {{describe}} the distribution and abundance and the size composition of Arctic <b>eel</b> <b>pout</b> Lycodes reticulatus, Esmark's eelpout L. esmarki, and Vahl's eelpout L. vahlii. The Arctic eelpout was the most abundant of the three species, occurring mainly in depths of 300 m at temperatures from- 0. 9 ° to 3. 5 0 C. Esmark's eelpout occurred over wide ranges of depth and temperature but seemed to prefer depths of 251 - 300 m at temperatures from 2. 6 ° to 3. 5 °C. Vahl's <b>eel</b> <b>pout</b> was prevalent in depths of 201 - 600 m at temperatures from 2. 1 ° to 4. 5 °C. All three species were more prevalent off southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland than on the Grand Bank. Length frequencies of samples from different parts of the area indicated increasing size from north to south for Arctic eelpout but no significant differences in average length for Esmark's and Vahl's eelpouts...|$|E
40|$|Some {{cold water}} marine fishes avoid {{cellular}} damage because of freezing by expressing antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to ice and inhibit its growth; one such protein is the globular type III AFP from <b>eel</b> <b>pout.</b> Despite several studies, {{the mechanism of}} ice binding remains unclear {{because of the difficulty}} in modeling the AFP-ice interaction. To further explore the mechanism, we have determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of 10 type III AFP mutants and combined that information with 7 previously determined structures to mainly analyze specific AFP-ice interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Quantitative assessment of binding was performed using a neural network with properties of the structure as input and predicted antifreeze activity as output. Using the cross-validation method, a correlatio...|$|E
60|$|The fishes {{commonly}} {{taken in}} this way are pickerel, suckers, perch, <b>eels,</b> <b>pouts,</b> breams, and shiners,--from thirty to sixty weight in a night. Some are hard to be recognized in the unnatural light, especially the perch, which, his dark bands being exaggerated, acquires a ferocious aspect. The number of these transverse bands, which the Report states to be seven, is, however, very variable, for in some of our ponds they have nine and ten even.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperManagement of the Danish protein {{fisheries}} in the North Sea has during recent years become increasingly politicised, as various stakeholder groups are seeking {{influence on the}} decision-making process. In relation to management of the sand <b>eel</b> and Norway <b>pout</b> fisheries, two different issues are debated. In the sand eel fishery, {{which is the most}} important fishery (value and volume), particularly British environmental organizations are accusing Danish fishers of removing the food base for important sea bird populations and commercial fish stocks, and thus the conflict of interest is primarily between fishers and environmental groups. The Norway pout fishery {{is a classic example of}} a within fisheries conflict (national or international). There is a clash of interest between fishers targeting Norway pout and fishers targeting species for human consumption, because there is a large by catch of primarily (haddock and whiting) in this fishery. In this paper the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to evaluate stakeholder preference towards the management of the two protein fisheries (sand <b>eel</b> and Norway <b>pout).</b> The research is based on interviews and a questionnaire survey with 12 different stakeholders in Denmark and the UK. The stakeholders represent industry organizations, management authorities, government fisheries research institutions and environmental organizations. Comparisons are made between different stakeholder preferences and the conflicts of interest are analysed. The results from the AHP analysis have been supplemented with qualitative information in order to present a more in-depth picture of the arguments presented by the various stakeholders, which are tunnelled into the decision-making process regarding the management of the sand <b>eel</b> and Norway <b>pout</b> {{fisheries in}} the North Sea...|$|R
50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand <b>eel,</b> Norway <b>pout,</b> blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total industrial fish catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|R
40|$|RD 1 is a 7 -kDa {{globular}} protein from the Antarctic <b>eel</b> <b>pout</b> Lycodichthys dearborni. It belongs to type III {{of the four}} types of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) found in marine fishes living at subzero temperatures. For type III AFP, a potential ice-binding flat surface has been identified and is imbedded with side chains capable of making hydrogen bonds with a specific lattice plane on ice. So far, all crystallographic studies on type III AFPs were carried out using the Atlantic ocean pout Macrozoarces americanus as the source organism. Here we present the crystal structure of a type III AFP from a different zoarcid fish, and at an ultra-high resolution of 0. 62 Å. The protein fold of RD 1 comprises a compact globular domain with two internal tandem motifs arranged about a pseudo-dyad symmetry. Each motif of the “pretzel fold” includes four short β-strands and a 310 helix. There is a novel internal cavity of 45 Å 3 surrounded by eight conserved nonpolar residues. The model contains several residues with alternate conformations, {{and a number of}} split water molecules, probably caused by alternate interactions with the protein molecule. After extensive refinement that includes hydrogen atoms, significant residual electron densities associated with the electrons of peptides and many other bonds could be visualized...|$|E
