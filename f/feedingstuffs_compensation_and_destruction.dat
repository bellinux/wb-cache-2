The total CEO <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> short <b>and</b> long-term <b>compensations</b> were tested regarding corporate performance. A panel data SUR model is estimated and describes the total <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> cash <b>compensation</b> {{as a proportion of}} total pay for the period between 2000 and 2010 in high-technologies firms. The findings indicate that there is a strong and positive relation between CEO <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> firm performance.

40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of papers that review the state of {{knowledge}} <b>and</b> practice regarding <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> rewards for environmental services in the developing world. The paper begins with an assessment of the historical development of <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> reward mechanisms within a broader context of changing approaches to nature conservation and environmental policy. The assessment shows that greater interest in <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> reward mechanisms has emerged within a policy context of changing approaches to nature conservation and flexible multi-stakeholder approaches to environmental management. In the developing world, an even greater variety of perspectives has emerged on the opportunities and threats for using <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> rewards for environmental services. Within that background, the paper clarifies key concepts - including the distinction between <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> reward - and presents a conceptual framework for typifying and characterizing different types of mechanisms that link ecosystem stewards, ecosystem service beneficiaries, and intermediaries...|$|R

40|$|We study whether CEO {{influence}} {{is evident in}} CEO incentive arrangements by examining how the imposition of state anti-takeover laws (ATLs) in the 1980 s affected CEO <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> retention. On balance, we find that CEOs have higher <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> more job security, <b>and</b> their <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> retention are less sensitive to stock-based performance after the enactment of ATLs. We also find that CEO <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> retention are more sensitive to accounting-based performance after ATLs, but the increased sensitivity is attributable to the accruals component of accounting-based performance. Based on prior evidence that CEOs often exercise discretion in measuring accounting-based performance, we interpret our results as evidence that CEOs have strong negotiation power vis-à-vis their corporate boards.
