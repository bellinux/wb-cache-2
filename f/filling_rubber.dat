40|$|Stress-strain {{behaviour}} of silica <b>filled</b> styrene-butadiene <b>rubber</b> showed strong hysteresis and cyclic softening, {{while these}} effects were almost negligible for the neat rubber. Significant Mullins effect occurs {{between the first}} and second loading cycles, whereupon samples reach their steady state after four repeated cycles. The degree of softening increases with volume content of silica characterizing the softening effect as a breakdown of the filler-formed microstructure defined by both, specific interactions in the filler associations and between the filler and rubber matrix. Contribution of different damage mechanisms to the total energy losses on different stages of extension was estimated by strain dependences of the hysteresis losses for different loading cycles. At the very beginning of deformation, energy losses of the <b>filled</b> <b>rubber</b> are associated with intensive destruction of the filler associations, while under large elongations the main contribution comes from the breakage of bonds between the rubber chains and fillers and from the rubber internal viscosity. After repeated loading-unloading cycles, the material structure is practically recovered in each cycle and hysteresis losses are caused by changes in the rubbery phase only.

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-heating}} temperature of <b>filled</b> <b>rubbers</b> under cyclic loading at environmental conditions is well-known. This increase in temperature seriously affects the constitutive stress–strain behavior by producing a thermal softening of the rubber compound. Although this feature is well-recognized and considered {{as important to}} its function, few constitutive thermo-mechanical models attempt to quantify the stress–temperature relationship. In this work, a physically-based model is developed to describe the large strain relaxed response of <b>filled</b> <b>rubbers</b> {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. The non-linear mechanical behavior is described via a Langevin formalism in which the temperature and filler effects are, respectively, included by a network thermal kinetics and an amplification of the first strain invariant. Experimental observations on the relaxed state of styrene-butadiene rubber hourglass-shaped specimens with a given carbon-black content are reported at different temperatures. A hybrid experimental–numerical method is proposed to determine simultaneously the local thermo-mechanical response and the model parameters. In addition, the predictive capability of the proposed constitutive thermo-mechanical model is verified by comparisons with results issued from micromechanical simulations containing different arrangements of the microstructure.

In order {{to study the}} effect of the material composition (amount of fillers and crosslink density) and of the stretch intensity, an original method for cyclic softening characterization is proposed. The softening is seen as an amplification of the stretch in the rubber gum, and a stretch amplification factor is then introduced as the softening parameter. The latter is evaluated for various materials and several levels of cyclic stretch intensity. Material softening is shown to increase with the loading intensity, the amount of carbon-black fillers and the decrease of the crosslink density. In terms of modelling, the introduced softening parameter provides access to the entire stress-stretch responses of the softened material for any cycle.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hysteresis}} {{observed in}} the mechanical response of <b>filled</b> <b>rubbers</b> is classically assumed {{to be due to}} viscosity. In this study, a complete energy balance is carried out during cyclic deformation of a <b>filled</b> acrylonitrile-butadiene <b>rubber.</b> Results show that for the studied material, viscosity is not the preponderant contribution to the hysteresis loop: the mechanical energy brought to the material is not entirely dissipated into heat but a contrario is mainly used by the material to change its microstructure. Moreover, no significant hysteresis loop is {{observed in the}} unfilled material. Hence, the filler network stores elastic energy during its deformation, leading to a change in the internal energy. The higher the stretch applied, the higher the relative stored energy, but the higher the stretch rate applied, the lower the relative stored energy in the filler network. This has been evidenced by defining a ratio γse in terms of energy. As hysteresis loop in rubbers does not systematically mean that intrinsic dissipation is produced, predicting changes in temperature, and consequently the self-heating, is not possible from the mechanical response only.

This thesis seeks to measure the behaviour and to study {{the possibility of using}} Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to predict the static behaviour of a rubber cylinder in combined torsion-tension and also the viscoelastic behaviour of rubber under various complex loadings using a Bergstrom-Boyce model 1 - 4. To measure the induced anisotropy, a rubber test piece is subjected to a simple extension l and then it is subjected to small strain oscillations {{in the direction of the}} pre-extension or in shear. These two different deformations will allow the extent of the anisotropy in the viscoelastic behaviour induced by the pre-extension to be measured. Kuhn and Kunzle 5 found that the loss factor resulting from a small oscillation decreased as a function of the static pre-strain. They and many others have interpreted this as a lowering of internal viscosity due to chain orientation. However, a simple analysis shows that this effect is due to geometric changes alone and that the essential viscoelastic behaviour expressed in terms of the deformed dimension after the application of the pre-strain as the loss modulus for an unfilled rubber is constant with strain up to an extension ratio of 2. It is also isotropic in behaviour for <b>filled</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds such as carbon black. For fumed silica <b>filled</b> <b>rubber,</b> the picture is more complex. For a moderately carbon black (25 phr) <b>filled</b> <b>rubber,</b> the loss modulus is still independent of the pre-strain for normal working strains but at highly filler contents (above 50 phr), the loss modulus increases with pre-strain at extension ratios somewhat less than 2. With silica, the coupling agent dominates the viscoelastic behaviour. For <b>filled</b> <b>rubber,</b> the change in loss modulus with strain can in part be explained by strain amplification, slippage of rubber around the filler, and shape factor effects. This approach can help to further understand the mechanism of filler reinforcement in rubber materials.

The classical elastic-ideal-plastic formulation exhibits a distinct yield-surface, whereas the elastoplastic material behavior of <b>filled</b> <b>rubber</b> components shows a yield-surface free plasticity.

Different types of carbon-black are characterized by their specific surface, morphology and the superstructure formed within the elastomer matrix. The effects of the filler networking on the electric conductivity and the dielectric properties of filled elastomers are not properly understood up to now. A better understanding of relation between the structure of carbon-black <b>filled</b> <b>rubber</b> and the electrical conductivity as well as dielectric relaxation behavior is crucial for usage of the dielectric relaxation spectroscopy for industrial applications (e. g. for laboratory testing or online monitoring). A series of different carbon black <b>filled</b> <b>rubbers</b> was examined. Both the content and the type of filler were varied. Two different matrices of polymer networks (natural rubber and EPDM) were used. The surface and the 3 -dimensional structure of the carbon black aggregates were characterized by small angle x-ray scattering. The dielectric permittivity were measured in a frequency range from about 10 - 4 to 10 + 9 Hz. The low frequency contribution of the dc-conductivity shows a percolation transition at a content of carbon-black of about 25 phr for the natural rubber network. This transition is related to the formation of a continuous conductivity paths of filler particles. The frequency dependence of the complex dielectric permittivity or alternatively of the comlex conductivity below and above the percolation threshold is characterized by the fractal structure of the filler network. The restricted diffusion of the charge carriers along the fractal percolation network and the small gaps along the conductive percolation paths (micro capacitors formed by the ''bound rubber'') determine the longest and shortest the relaxation time of the relaxation spectrum.
