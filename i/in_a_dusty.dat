2500|$|The stripe color varies {{due to the}} {{influence}} and interaction of other genes. Another genetic characteristic makes the stripes of the tiger very pale; white tigers of this type are called snow-white or [...] "pure white". White tigers, Siamese cats, and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to temperature, causing them to grow darker in the cold. A white tiger named Mohini was whiter than her relatives in the Bristol Zoo, who showed more cream tones. This may have been because she spent less time outdoors in the winter. Kailash Sankhala observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa State, {{even when they were}} born in New Delhi and returned there. [...] "In spite of living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dusty</b> courtyard, they were always snow white." [...] A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced pigmentation in white tigers.|$|E

60|$|Journalism had become, {{like most}} other such things in England under the {{cautious}} government and philosophy represented by James Barker, somewhat sleepy and much diminished in importance.
