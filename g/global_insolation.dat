40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for developing a}} simple theoretical model for calculating <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> on a horizontal surface is described in this paper.

Both the parameters are easily measurable with inexpensive instrument such as global positioning system (GPS). The principal idea behind the paper is to have-a model {{that could be used for}} designing a photo voltaic system quickly and within reasonable accuracy. The model in this paper has been developed using measured data from 12 locations in India covering length and breadth of the country over a period of 9 - 22 years. The model is validated by calculating theoretical <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> for five locations, one in north (New Delhi), one in south (Thir-uvanandapuram),one in east (Kolkata), one in west (Mumbai) and one in central (Nagpur) part of India and comparing them with the measured in solation values for these five locations. The measured values of all these locations had been considered for developing the model. The model is further validated for a location (Goa) whose measured data is not considered for developing the model, by comparing the calculated and measured values of the insolation. Over the range of latitudes covering most parts of India, the error is within 20 % of the measured value.

30|$|There {{are several}} points {{to take note}} before the dataset can be used. The {{selected}} region crosses two different timezones in the US, namely, the Mountain timezone and the Central timezone. As the data is recorded at local time, {{it is important to}} make the time synchronizations among all the pixels. To achieve this, a shape (.shp) file of the world timezones is used to identify each pixel for its respective timezone. The shape file is downloadable at [URL] The SUNY data is derived from two satellites, namely, GOES-East and GOES-West. The image capturing of these two satellites take place at 15 mins past an hour and on the hour, respectively. Although the SUNY gridded data is shifted in time (using interpolation) for consistency, we find the hourly readings from two adjacent pixels (within the same timezone but obtained using different satellites) can be very different. To further stabilize the variance in the temporal data, the daily <b>global</b> horizontal <b>insolation</b> (Wh/m 2 /day) is converted into daily clearness index, which is the ratio between the <b>global</b> horizontal <b>insolation</b> and the extraterrestrial insolation (the sum of hourly extraterrestrial irradiance). The hourly extraterrestrial irradiance for each pixel is calculated using the Solar Positioning Algorithm (SPA), a c program developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (2008). The daily clearness index is used as input for the network design algorithms. The total data processing time is around 8 h using a typical personal computer. Through the data processing, a 10, 000 (100 × 100 pixels) by 731 (2 years with one of them being a leap year) matrix of daily clearness index is produced.

40|$|The {{luminescence}} of calcite speleothems displays an exponential {{dependence on}} soil temperature {{unless there is}} a dense cover of forest over the cave to dampen it. This relationship is determined primarily by the strength of solar visible and infrared radiation. It is suggested that, as a consequence, the microzonal variations of luminescence often found in speleothems {{can be used as a}} proxy index of Solar Insolation. The luminescence solar insolation proxy record of a speleothem from Jewel Cave, South Dakota, USA, was found to display millenial and centennial cycles in the record. It exhibits a rapid increase in solar insolation at 139 ± 5. 5 kyrs. This increase precedes that suggested by the Orbital theory by about 10, 000 years and is due to superimposition of the most powerful cycle in solar luminosity of 11. 5 kyrs, upon the curve of orbital variations. The record from a speleothem in Duhlata Cave, Bulgaria matches that of South Dakota within the limits of dating error, indicating that both of these records (which are 10, 000 km apart) measure <b>global</b> solar <b>insolation</b> controls rather than local paleotemperature variations...|$|R

40|$|The coupled climate {{dynamics}} underlying large, rapid, {{and potentially}} irreversible changes in ice cover are studied. A global atmosphere–ocean–sea ice general circulation model with idealized aquaplanet geometry is forced by gradual multi-millennial variations in solar luminosity. The model traverses a hysteresis loop between warm ice-free conditions and cold glacial conditions {{in response to}} ± 5 W m− 2 variations in <b>global,</b> annual-mean <b>insolation.</b> Comparison of several model configurations confirms the importance of polar ocean processes in setting the sensitivity and time scales of the transitions. A “sawtooth” character is found with faster warming and slower cooling, reflecting the opposing effects of surface heating and cooling on upper-ocean buoyancy and, thus, effective heat capacity. The transition from a glacial to warm, equable climate occurs in about 200 years. In contrast to the “freshwater hosing” scenario, transitions are driven by radiative forcing and sea ice feedbacks. The ocean circulation, and notably the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), does not drive the climate change. The MOC (and associated heat transport) collapses poleward of the advancing ice edge, {{but this is a}} purely passive response to cooling and ice expansion.

40|$|Models {{to compute}} Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) {{have been in}} {{development}} over the last 3 decades. These models can be classified as empirical or physical, based on the approach. Empirical models relate ground based observations with satellite measurements and use these relations to compute surface radiation. Physical models consider the radiation received from the earth at the satellite and create retrievals to estimate surface radiation. While empirical methods have been traditionally used for computing surface radiation for the solar energy industry the advent of faster computing has made operational physical models viable. The <b>Global</b> Solar <b>Insolation</b> Project (GSIP) is an operational physical model from NOAA that computes GHI using the visible and infrared channel measurements from the GOES satellites. GSIP uses a two-stage scheme that first retrieves cloud properties and uses those properties in a radiative transfer model to calculate surface radiation.

40|$|International audienceThe Levant, a {{transition}} zone between the temperate Mediterranean domain and subtropical deserts, {{is a key}} area to study the latitudinal migrations of zonal climatic belts in response to glacial-interglacial conditions. The region underwent large climatic shifts during the Late Quaternary, with dramatic impacts on water resources and human populations. This paper presents the unique long-term hydro-climatic record (ca. 400 ka) from Northern Levant, derived from a sediment core taken from a small tectonic basin of northern Lebanon, the currently wettest area of the Levant. Combined biotic (pollen, biologic aquatic remains) and abiotic proxies (sediment properties, carbonate oxygen isotopes) reveal relatively high water availability during interglacials and generally drier glacials periods during the past four climate cycles. These general trends {{are in line with}} pollen records from southeastern and near east Mediterranean areas, but differ from some paleohydrological records from the southern Levant. Southward migrations of the rain-bearing mid-latitude westerlies during glacial periods and regional land topography are likely to explain the observed regional climate signatures.

Dark inactivation rates (kDs) were measured (from log-linear survival curves) in enclosed chambers and 6 -liter pots. The kD for FC was 2 to 4 times that for Ent, and inactivation was generally slower at lower temperatures. Sunlight inactivation was {{described in terms of}} shoulder size (n) and the slope (k) of the log-linear portion of the survival curve as a function of <b>global</b> solar <b>insolation</b> and UV-B fluence. The n values tended to be larger for Ent than for FC, and the k values for FC were around twice those for Ent in both effluent-seawater mixtures. The combined sunlight data showed a general inactivation rate (k) ranking in effluent-seawater mixtures of meatworks FC > sewage FC > meatworks Ent > sewage Ent. Describing 90 % inactivation in terms of insolation (S 90) gave far less seasonal variation than T 90 (time-dependent) values. However, there were significant differences in inactivation rates between experiments, indicating the contribution to inactivation of factors other than insolation. Inactivation rates under different long-pass optical filters decreased with the increase in the spectral cutoff wavelength (lambda 50) of the filters and indicated little contribution by UV-B to total inactivation.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of boundary layer cumulus clouds {{and their impact}} on land surface–atmosphere exchange is presented. Seasonal trends indicate that in response to increasing insolation and sensible heat flux, both the mixed-layer height (zi) and the lifting condensation level (LCL) peak (; 1250 and 1700 m) just before the growing season commences. With the commencement of transpiration, the Bowen ratio falls abruptly in response to the infusion of additional moisture into the boundary layer, and zi and LCL decrease. By late spring, boundary layer cumulus cloud frequency increases sharply, as the mixed layer approaches a new equilibrium, with zi and LCL remaining relatively constant (; 1100 and 1500 m) through the summer. Boundary layer cloud time fraction peaks during the growing season, reaching values greater than 40 % over most of the eastern United States by June. At an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) station in central Massachusetts, a growing season peak is apparent during 1995 – 98 but reveals large variations in monthly frequency due to periods of drought or excessive wetness. Light–cloud cover regression relationships developed from ASOS ceilometer reports for Orange, Massachusetts, and Harvard Forest insolation data show a good linear fit (r 2 5 0. 83) for overall cloud cover versus insolation, and a reasonable quadratic fit (r 2 5 0. 48) for cloud cover versus the standard deviation of insolation, which is an indicator of sky type.

40|$|The low-latitude {{upwelling}} regime off the Mauritanian {{coast in}} the subtropical NE Atlantic {{accounts for a}} significant part of global export production. Although productivity variations in coastal upwelling areas are usually attributed to changes in wind stress and upwelling intensity, productivity dynamics off Mauritania are less straightforward because of the complex atmospheric and hydrographic setting. Here we integrate micropaleontological (diatoms) and geochemical (bulk biogenic sediment components, X-ray fluorescence, and alkenones) proxies to examine on submillennial-to-millennial changes in diatom production that occurred off Mauritania, NW Africa, for the last 25 ka. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19. 0 – 23. 0 ka B. P.), moderate silicate content of upwelled waters coupled with weakened NE trade winds determined moderate diatom productivity. No significant cooling is observed during the LGM, suggesting that our alkenone-based SST reconstruction represents a local, upwelling-related signal rather than a <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> related one. Extraordinary increases in diatom and opal concentrations during Heinrich event 1 (H 1, 15. 5 – 18. 0 ka B. P.) and the Younger Dryas (YD, 13. 5 – 11. 5 ka B. P.) are attributed to enhanced upwelling of silica-rich waters and an enlarged upwelling filament, due to more intense NE trade winds. The synchronous increase of CaCO 3 and K intensity and the decreased opal and diatoms values mark the occurrence of the Bølling/Allerød (BA, 13. 5 – 15. 5 ka B. P.) due to weakened eolian input and more humid conditions on land. Although the high export of diatoms is inextricably linked to upwelling intensity off Mauritania, variability in the nutrient content of the thermocline also plays a decisive role.

40|$|AbstractThe {{statistical}} {{characterization of}} the solar resource (direct normal solar radiation) is a key point in the initial phases of a solar thermal electricity (STE) plant project. Ideally, this characterization {{should be based on}} long time series (at least 8 years) of on-site measured data of Direct Normal Insolation (DNI) and other meteorological parameters. Unfortunately, there are very few places around the world where such time series are available, so alternative methods have to be used. Most of them rely on the application of global-to-direct conversion models to long time series of <b>Global</b> Horizontal <b>Insolation</b> (GHI), measured or derived from satellite images, to estimate the long-term resource. Usually, a meteorological station including sensors for the measurement of DNI is installed at the selected project site {{at the beginning of the}} project. The data collected during the measurement campaign, which normally extends between a few months and 2 years, are used to adjust the conversion models and to correct the estimates. In this paper, a simple empirical model that relates monthly clearness index and monthly direct normal fraction is used to estimate monthly and annual long-term DNI from statistically representative monthly values of GHI. This model is adjusted with GHI and DNI data collected during measurement campaigns of different durations. We show that the accuracy of the proposed model is under ± 5 % and that this accuracy improves sharply with the duration of the test campaign. For this purpose, we have used 13 years of high quality DNI and GHI data from the radiometric station of the Group of Thermodynamics and Renewable Energies (GTER) of the University of Seville, Spain. The results suggest that, this simple empirical model is a good alternative to the present methodologies when short DNI measurement campaign but long-term GHI values are available...|$|R

According to the results of the analysis, it is required to tilt the surface maximum of 30 towards the south and maximum of 25 towards the North during a year to maximize the solar resource potential on the tilted surface free to rotate about its East-West axis, placed at zero surface azimuth angle. 1918 kWh/m 2 per annum was the estimated maximum possible solar resource potential on tilted surface which is 5. 1 % greater than that of horizontal surface. With the availability of Solar Radiation data, it may possible to assess the Solar Resource Potential of any other location of the country in future by using the same procedure...|$|R
40|$|The Sun {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} driving force of the climate system. However, only little is known how variable this force is acting on di!erent time scales ranging from minutes to millennia and how the climate system reacts to changes in this forcing. Changes of the <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> can be related to the nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun, the energy transport through the radiative zone and the convection zone, the emission of radiation from the photosphere, and the distance between Sun and Earth. Satellite based measurements over two decades show a clear correlation between the solar irradiance and the 11 -year sunspot cycle. The irradiance amplitude is about 0. 1 %. This is too small to a!ect signi"cantly the climate. However, there are indications that, on longer time scales, solar variability coluld be much larger. The analysis of cosmogenic nuclides stored in natural archives provides a means to extend our knowledge of solar variability over much longer time periods. The response of the climate system to solar forcing depends not only on the amount of radiation, but also on its spectral composition (e. g. UV contribution), seasonal distribution over the globe, and feedback mechanisms connected with clouds, water vapour, ice cover, atmospheric and oceanic transport and other terrestrial processes. It is therefore di$cult to establish a quantitative relationship between observed climate changes in the past and reconstructed solar variability. However, there is growing evidence that periods of low solar activity (so called minima) coincide with advances of glaciers, changes in lake levels, and sudden changes of climatic conditions. These "ndings point to an active role of the Sun in past climate changes beside other geophysical factors, interna...|$|E
40|$|Since Alvarez et al., {{discovered}} a worldwide approx. cm-thick layer of fine sediments laden with platinum group elements in approximately chondritic proportions exactly at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (C-T) boundary, and proposed bolide-impact as triggering mass extinctions, many have studied this hypothesis and the layer itself with its associated spherules and shocked quartz. At {{issue is whether}} the mass extinctions, and this horizon has an impact versus volcanic origin. A critical feature of the Alvarez hypothesis is {{the suggestion that the}} bolide or possibly a shower of objects delivered to the earth approx. 0. 6 x 10 to the 18 th power g of material which resulted in aerosol-sized ejecta such that <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> was drastically reduced for significant periods. Such an event would lower temperatures on continents and halt photosynthesis in the upper 200 m of th eocean. The latter would strangle the marine food chain and thus produce the major marine faunal extinctions which mark the C-T boundary. Crucial issues examined include: What are the dynamics of atmospheric flow occurring upon impact of a large bolide with the earth; What is the size distributions of the very fine impact ejecta and how do these compare to the models of ejecta which are used to model the earth's radiative thermal balance. The flow field due to passage of a 10 km diameter bolide through an exponential atmosphere and the interaction of the gas flow and bolide with the solid ear was calculated. The CO 2 released upon impact onto shallow marine carbonate sections was modeled and found that the mass of CO 2 released exceeds the present 10 to the 18 th power g CO 2 budget of the earth's atmosphere by several times. Using the calculations of Kasting and Toon it was found that to compute the temperature rise of the earth's surface as a function of CO 2 content, it was found that sudden and prolonged global increases are induced from impact of 20 to 50 km radius projectiles and propose that sudden terrestrial greenhouse-induced heating, not cooling, produced the highly variable extinctions seen at the C-T boundary...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic will be {{affected}} by global warming much more than any other region of the world bearing global consequences by albedo decrease, freshwater runoff, carbon release, and changes in biodiversity (ACIA, 2004). Looking for analogues of climate warming and biotic response, we previously reconstructed vegetation and climate in the most continental and climatically most stable part of the terrestrial Eurasian Arctic during warm extremes of the Eemian and Early Holocene interglacials and during the Mid Weichselian interstadial in contrast to the Late Holocene (Kienast et al. 2005, Kienast et al. submitted). Our reconstructions base on plant macrofossils preserved in East Siberian permafrost deposits. Accordingly, all warm phases except for the Late Holocene show similar vegetation patterns supporting a mosaic of several plant communities including boreal aquatics, floodplain meadows with halophytes and steppes at times supplemented by shrubs and wetlands. During the Late Holocene in contrast, the fossil species spectra indicate a dramatic decrease in diversity of vegetation types and available habitats (Kienast 2006). From about 5000 years BP on, the species spectra consist almost exclusively of wetland plants reflecting permanently wet conditions and low summer temperature. This event coincides with a global temperature decrease and with the establishment of the modern coast line in the Laptev Shelf region (Bauch et al. 2001) resulting in humidification of Arctic East Siberia. The described differences and, in particular, the analogy of climate and vegetation during the Eemian and the pre-transgression stage of the Early Holocene indicate that the Northeast Siberian shelves have been during former warm stages, including the Eemian, much less inundated than now resulting in higher continental climate. Accordingly, the oceanic influence on climate due to the vast Holocene marine transgression in North Siberia is a very young phenomenon and probably the result of tectonic extension and subsidence of the Laptev and the western East Siberian Shelves. To highlight differences between both warm stages and to reveal consequences of the assumed coast line shift, we proposed a new project at the German Research Foundation (DFG). As a part of that project, we intend to reconstruct the Eemian and Holocene thermal optima in the Northeast Siberian shelf region more in detail, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Simultaneous to these reconstructions, a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (ECHO-G) will be used within that project to explain responsible mechanisms, global and regional, resulting in climatic differences. Climate patterns, formerly simulated with that model, were, e. g. in Europe, in good agreement with reconstructions (Kaspar et al., 2005). In adjusting the models set-up, it is to be clarified whether the climatic differences between both warm stages can be explained by <b>global</b> <b>insolation</b> changes alone or if internal climate parameters such as the supposed alteration of the land-sea mask in the study region amplified the external insolation effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{inactivation}} of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica, {{compared with}} Escherichia coli, was determined in 100 l chambers of seawater and river water located {{at an outdoor}} site. The chambers (paired with dark controls) were seeded with waste stabilization pond effluent and laboratory-cultured pathogens, and exposed to sunlight in summer and winter experiments. All sunlight inactivation (kS) rates, {{as a function of}} cumulative <b>global</b> solar radiation (<b>insolation),</b> were far higher than the corresponding dark (kD) rates, with a ranking (and average kS rates for seawater and river water, respectively) of: C. jejuni (3. 23; 2. 34). S. enterica (0. 51; 0. 37). E. coli (0. 34; 0. 26). All the T 90 (time to 90 % inactivation) values were higher in winter than in summer, but there was far greater similarity between the summer and winter S 90 (insolation needed for 90 % inactivation) values. The rapid inactivation of C. jejuni was attributed to a high susceptibility to photooxidative damage. The results suggest that, in sunlight-exposed waters, E. coli will be a more conservative indicator for C. jejuni than for S. enterica, and C. jejuni transmission as a pathogenic agent is less likely than for S. enterica.

40|$|African {{climate is}} {{generally}} considered to have evolved towards progressively drier conditions {{over the past few}} million years, with increased variability as glacial–interglacial change intensified worldwide 1, 2, 3. Palaeoclimate records derived mainly from northern Africa exhibit a 100, 000 -year (eccentricity) cycle overprinted on a pronounced 20, 000 -year (precession) beat, driven by orbital forcing of summer <b>insolation,</b> <b>global</b> ice volume and long-lived atmospheric greenhouse gases 4. Here we present a 1. 3 -million-year-long climate history from the Lake Malawi basin (10 °– 14 ° S in eastern Africa), which displays strong 100, 000 -year (eccentricity) cycles of temperature and rainfall following the Mid-Pleistocene Transition around 900, 000 years ago. Interglacial periods were relatively warm and moist, while ice ages were cool and dry. The Malawi record shows limited evidence for precessional variability, which we attribute to the opposing effects of austral summer insolation and the temporal/spatial pattern of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. The temperature history of the Malawi basin, at least for the past 500, 000 years, strongly resembles past changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and terrigenous dust flux in the tropical Pacific Ocean, but not in global ice volume. Climate in this sector of eastern Africa (unlike northern Africa) evolved from a predominantly arid environment with high-frequency variability to generally wetter conditions with more prolonged wet and dry intervals...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} changes in the {{magnitude}} of oceanic tidal mixing on long time scales is an important, but previously unrecognized, contributor to global climate change. {{it is well known}} that Earth's orbital and rotational state changes significantly on 10 (exp 4) - 10 (exp 5) year time scales, and that this influences the spatial and temporal pattern of incident radiation. It is widely supposed that climatic variations on these same time scales are, in large part, a response of the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system to this radiative forcing. Our proposal is that variations in the luni-solar tidal potential, induced by these same orbital and rotational variations, influences oceanic mixing and thus modulates meridional heat transport, by amounts which are competitive with the radiative forcing. There are some obvious differences between tidal potential and insolation. First is that the Sun and Moon both contribute to tides, whereas the radiation is entirely of solar origin. Second is that the Earth is transparent to gravity but opaque to radiation. Clipping associated with this opacity makes the radiation pattern temporal spectrum rather more complex than the tidal spectrum. A third point is that solar radiation directly delivers energy to Earth's surface whereas tidal mixing will only expedite lateral transport of heat in association with oceanic thermohaline circulation. The diurnal average insolation pattern is best parameterized via a Fourier series in time of year and Legendre polynomials in sine of latitude. Our present focus will be on the annual average terms. The Legendre degree n= 0 term describes the <b>global</b> average <b>insolation,</b> and is nearly constant. The degree n=l term describes differences between northern and southern hemispheres, and the annual mean is zero. The degree n= 2 term is the main contributor to the equator to pole variations, and varies with obliquity and orbital eccentricity, with the obliquity variation dominating. The lowest order decomposition of the tidal potential recognizes 3 constituents: semi-diurnal, diurnal, and long period, with solar and lunar contributions to each. Our present focus will be on long term variations in the mean square amplitude of the semi-diurnal constituent, with averaging over all the short period variations. For the solar tide that includes the day and year. For the lunar tide it includes the day, month, year, and the apsidal (8. 85 year) and nodal (18. 6 year) periods. We present calculations of the variations in radiative and tidal forcing for the past 3 million years. The two signals are quite similar. Both vary by approximately 1 % of their respective mean values, are dominated by obliquity variations, and exhibit only secondary influence from orbital eccentricity...|$|R
