According to NPR's Morning Edition, Bunker has [...] "become a revered voice to many members of Anonymous", and they refer to him as [...] "Wise Beard Man". Bunker told Newsweek that he {{was pleased to see}} a large group of young individuals acting against Scientology, but stated he was also concerned for their safety: [...] "I know the way Scientology works: they're going to <b>get</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> in trouble ... I'm very concerned about their safety, and I'm concerned about the Scientologists' safety, too." [...] Bunker stated that he has received 6,000 emails from individuals who say they are part of Anonymous. Bunker attended the February 10, 2008 protest against Scientology in Los Angeles.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the thick}} smoke, nine {{passengers}} found themselves trapped inside the airport lounge of Air France on the mezzanine level above the arrivals hall of Terminal A. The Salon was not staffed; passengers eligible {{to utilize the}} amenities had been handed an access code upon check-in. This resulted in {{a lack of knowledge}} of the nearest escape route (which would have been to take a staircase leading to the rooftop). The airport fire brigade was unaware of the exact location of the lounge, which added to the difficulty in <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> out, even though they sent a number of distress calls, the last one at 16:19. Only one man managed to escape by smashing a window and jumping out. He was rescued at around 17:00, suffering from serious head injuries. He fully recovered from his injuries.|$|R

60|$|This {{experiment}} was baseball. In {{order to give}} the thing vogue from the start, and place {{it out of the}} reach of criticism, I chose my nines by rank, not capacity. There wasn't a knight in either team who wasn't a sceptered sovereign. As for material of this sort, there was a glut of it always around Arthur. You couldn't throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king. Of course, I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> to leave off their armor; they wouldn't do that when they bathed. They consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other, but that was the most they would do. So, one of the teams wore chain-mail ulsters, and the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer steel. Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I ever saw. Being ball-proof, they never skipped out of the way, but stood still and took the result; when a Bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him, it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes. And when a man was running, and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad coming into port. At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires, but I had to discontinue that. These people were no easier to please than other nines. The umpire's first decision was usually his last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him home on a shutter. When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game, umpiring got to be unpopular. So I was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, the Ministry of Interior said: [...] "It is a {{possibility}} that it is an attack by terrorists, so we are treating the matter very seriously." [...] Nairobi police chief Benson Kibue called the incident a [...] "terrorist" [...] attack and added that there were likely no more than 10 perpetrators involved. Senator Billow Kerrow from Mandera County, Nairobi said: [...] "It's too early to know what kind of <b>people</b> <b>these</b> are, but from what we are <b>getting,</b> <b>these</b> are <b>people</b> who speak in the Swahili language. They are people who seem to know what they are doing, are pretty much organised. It's really quite a shocking thing because from what we're getting, they aren't ordinary thugs." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a New Yorker {{interview}} with CIA veteran Michael Scheuer, {{an author of}} the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer Jane Mayer noted, In 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally—including access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea... 'What was clever was {{that some of the}} senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,' Scheuer said. 'It served American purposes to <b>get</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> arrested, and Egyptian purposes to <b>get</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> back, where they could be interrogated.' Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek 'assurances' from foreign governments that rendered suspects won't be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was 'not sure' if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a mixed methods study. The study {{is part of the}} Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. The project developed a learning process designed to help people better anticipate, monitor and respond to rural change in UK uplands. It identified data sources, gaps and methods {{that could be used to}} further develop, test and streamline the process in the next phase of the research. Working in the Peak District National Park, the research focussed on managed burning, and contributed to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) consultation on their review of the Heather and Grass Burning Code. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a broad cross-section of upland management stakeholders from the Peak District National Park. The research found deep-seated conflict over burning and little regular contact between many groups. However, most of the individuals that were interviewed from each group recognised considerable overlap between their views on upland management and the views of those they knew from opposing groups. The study pioneered the use of Social Network Analysis in environmental management, to ensure all relevant groups were involved in the research. The analysis identified a few key individuals who were both well known and with whom many people felt they shared views. By <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> involved in negotiations about the way land managers can respond to future change, it may be possible to reach agreements more easily and gain wider acceptance. Further information and documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal: Sustainable Uplands: Management for Multiple Benefits. Main Topics : Sustainability of UK uplands and the management of rural change; social networks related to rural land management; participatory research. <br...|$|R

The character once seduced a transsexual within the prison at the behest of Sucre so as to obtain a pair of female undergarments necessary for a ruse; yet previously mocked the individual, stating 'I may be social, but that's the boundary line even I won't cross.'

Before German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler turned to mass extermination of Jews by way of The Holocaust, the possibility of having refugees sent to willing countries was posed. Sumner Welles, the U.S. Under Secretary of State had proposed an international conference to address the immigration issue. Going into the conference Roosevelt gave Taylor the instruction: [...] "All {{you need to do is}} <b>get</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> together."

6000|$|There is {{something}} so extremely dishonest, too, in acknowledging quotations. Possibly {{the good people}} who so contrive that such signatures as [...] "Shakespeare," [...] "Homer," [...] or [...] "St. Paul," [...] appear to be written here and there to parts of their inferior work, manage to justify the proceeding in their conscience; but it is uncommonly like hallmarking pewter {{on the strength of}} an infinitesimal tinge of silver therein. The point becomes at once clear if we imagine some obscure painter quoting the style of Raphael and fragments of his designs, and acknowledging his indebtedness by appending the master's signature. Blank forgery!

The people who had previously existed solely on the tundra, gravitated towards new settlements on the riverbanks of the Kanchalan River, near the present site of the selo of Kanchalan, from where the culture <b>gets</b> its name. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> no longer relied on hunting for survival, but combined this with fishing. The fishing eventually developed into open sea hunting for whales and walruses, whilst those who still lived off the land began to tame the wild reindeer they hunted to form ever larger herds. The economy of the region was driven mainly by these activities until the 17th century.|$|R
