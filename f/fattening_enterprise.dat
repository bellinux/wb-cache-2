40|$|The {{small scale}} cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> is {{represents}} {{an important component}} of the agribusiness sector of the economy with great economic, income, poverty reduction and social implications. A large number of farmers involved in cattle fattening just before 3 or 4 months of Eid-ul-Azha (Muslim festival), when they sell the animals with profitable prices. Cattle fattening for beef production have become an important business of the small farmers in Bangladesh. This study examined the profitability as well as operational economics efficiency of cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> of Rajbari District. Data used to achieve this objective was obtained from 120 nomadic farmers, which were randomly selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. Data were generated using a survey schedule as well as direct observation (cost-route method). Descriptive statistics, economics analysis as well as operational efficiency index were used to analyze the data. Results showed that small scale cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> were profitable and flexible. A net enterprise income of BDT 5559 per cattle was realized by an average enterprise in study area. It was also shown that operational efficiency was not generally high among the entrepreneur. Based on these results, the study advised less efficient entrepreneurs to adopt the practices of the efficient ones in order to make the enterprise more profitable. The study shows that small scale cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> is profitable due to agribusiness context. Farmers used three years old cattle for beef fattening. Cattle fattening period is 4. 5 months in rural study areas of Rajbari district in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|The {{fattening}} of the Japanese Breed of Cattle was studied {{from the}} standpoint of farm management in relation to the Japanese Cattle. The study was carried out in Ato Town, Abu County, in Yamaguti Prefecture by examining into the farmers of the region. The following results were obtained: 1) The <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> of the Japanese Polled Breed of Cattle is on the increase in arithmetical progression year by year. Though the farmers still devote themselves to the cereal farming. It is not yet widely diffused in the farmers as regards the fattening of the Japanese Cattle. 2) The farmers, in general, do not look for the means of self-supporting and self-sufficing in respect of forage crops, and they depend on the purchased fodders. 3) The managerical technique is not appropriate for the fattening of the cattle. 4) The purchasing the “Motousi” (original cattle to be fattened) is not properly done,and the price is higher in comparison with the sale price of the fattened beef-cattle. 5) The fodder price and the management expense require large sum and the income becomes very small after all...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} {{in the form of a}} guide which dryland wheat farmers may use in planning a supplementary cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Because of the nature of the subject, this guide cannot be a precise step-by-step process, which, if followed, will bring about an exact result. It is, rather, a loose, somewhat pliable framework which can be used in an effort to maximize specific results. The underlying assumption is that, regardless of the project, one must follow some semblance of order or little good will be derived. A study of this type is timely for three reasons: (1) the dryland wheat farmer is searching for a profitable use of his surplus labor during the winter months; (2) he already possesses many of the facilities required in cattle feeding; and (3) he has had little or no experience in this type of operation. For the first two reasons, it is predicted that many wheat farmers will begin a winter cattle fattening program. For the last reason, a guide is needed to assist the inexperienced feeder in his venture. On the following pages the problem is first discussed, analyzed and limited. A general discussion follows on the aspects and processes involved in pre-budget planning. Finally, the guide is formulated...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in pigs in Northern Italy was serologically examined. The survey {{was carried out}} on 39 farms: 17 farrow-to-feeder, 10 farrow-to-finish, and 12 <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprises.</b> There were 1, 422 sera that were tested using commercial indirect ELISA. This method originally developed for testing human sera was adapted {{for the analysis of}} pig sera. All farms except one (97. 43 %) and 714 sera samples (50. 21 %) resulted positive for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. This study confirms that HEV is widespread in pigs in Italy and might be endemic on most farms...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} a genetic {{association}} study between five nucleotide polymorphisms (5 ′UTR microsatellite ((TG) n), nt- 7 (C>A), L 24 V, DelR 242 and Intron 1 microsatellite) of the GHSR 1 a gene and growth and carcass traits in 1285 steers sired by 117 Japanese Black bulls in a progeny testing program. We report herein, a significant association between the 5 ′UTR microsatellite and nt- 7 (C>A) loci and growth and carcass traits. We also propose a translational hypothesis that the association is {{due to differences in}} the secondary structure of GHSR 1 b mRNA (the non-spliced type with the 5 ′UTR microsatellite) among the GHSR 1 a gene haplotypes. Furthermore, we predicted the potential increase in profitability due to increased carcass weight in cow-calf <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprises</b> through planned matings based on DNA testing of the 5 ′UTR microsatellite. Statistical analysis revealed that the 5 ′UTR microsatellite locus had a significant additive effect on carcass weight (CW) and average daily gain (ADG), but not on beef marbling score (BMS). One of the four major microsatellite alleles (19 -TG allele) with an allele frequency of 0. 145, had a significantly (P < 0. 0007) desirable effect on CW and ADG. We concluded that the 19 -TG allele could potentially be economically useful nucleotide markers for growth and carcass traits in Japanese Black cattle...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin - Growth hormone secretagogue {{receptor}} 1 a (GHS-R 1 a) {{is involved}} in many important functions including growth hormone (GH) secretion and food intake. In this chapter, we explore existing nucleotide polymorphisms, transcriptional analysis, gene expression of the bovine GHS-R 1 a gene and its genetic association with growth and carcass traits in cattle. Firstly, we evaluated haplotype variety and characterized the microsatellite ((TG) n, 5 ’-untransrated region (UTR)) and nucleotide polymorphisms of the GHS-R 1 a gene in cattle. Nucleotide sequencing of this gene (6 kb) revealed 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), four indels and the microsatellite ((GTTT) n, Intron 1). The 19 haplotypes were constructed from all nucleotide viability patterns and divided into 3 major groups. Four SNPs (L 24 V, nt 456 (G>A), D 191 N and nt 667 (C>T)) and DelR 242 in Exon 1 and a haplotype block of about 2. 2 kb (nt 667 (C>T) ～ nt 2884 (A>G)) were identified in Bos taurus breeds. Significant breed differences in allele frequencies of the two microsatellites, nt- 7 (C>A), L 24 V, and DelR 242 loci were found. A DelR 242 {{was found in the}} Japanese Shorthorn (frequency: 0. 44), Japanese Brown, 5 European cattle breeds, the Philippine native cattle, but none detected in the Japanese Black nor the Mishima Island cattle. Secondly, 5 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5 ’- RACE) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that there were two different kinds of transcripts: spliced, without a microsatellite within 5 ’-UTR (GHS-R 1 a); and non-spliced, with the microsatellite (GHS-R 1 b). Thirdly, we examined age-related changes in the expressions of GHS-R 1 a and GHS-R 1 b (the truncated-type receptor) in the arcuate nucleus, pituitary gland and other tissues by realtime RT-PCR in cattle. The GHS-R 1 a mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus of postweaning calves was more than 10 -fold higher than those of pre-weaning calves and cows, and its expression level was the highest in all tissues examined. The GHS-R 1 a mRNA expression in the pituitary gland of pre-weaning calves was higher than those of postweaning calves and cows. The GHS-R 1 b mRNA expression was widespread in all tissues examined and predominantly occurred in the pancreas, pituitary gland, spleen and arcuate nucleus in adult. Fourthly, we carried out a genetic association study between five nucleotide polymorphisms (5 ’UTR microsatellite ((TG) n), nt- 7 (C>A), L 24 V, DelR 242 and Intron 1 microsatellite (GTTT) n) of the GHS-R 1 a gene and growth and carcass traits in 1, 285 steers sired by 117 Japanese Black bulls in a progeny testing program. Statistical analysis revealed that the 5 ’UTR microsatellite locus had a significant additive effect on carcass weight (CW) and average daily gain (ADG). One of the four major microsatellite alleles (19 -TG allele) with an allele frequency of 0. 145, had a significantly desirable effect on CW and ADG. We proposed a translational hypothesis that the association is due to differences in the secondary structure of GHS-R 1 b mRNA (the non-spliced type with the 5 ’UTR microsatellite) among the GH-SR 1 a gene haplotypes. Finally, we predicted the potential increase in profitability due to increased CW in cow-calf <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprises</b> through planned matings based on DNA testing of the 5 ’UTR microsatellite. We concluded that the 19 -TG allele could potentially be an economically useful nucleotide marker for growth and carcass traits in Japanese Black cattle...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{has been}} prepared for your use. It is not intended that the average presented here will represent your farm exactly, but the information will be useful to you in planning your <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> for greater profit. The information reported is based on interview with 103 feedlot operator who fattened cattle during the 1953 - 54 feeding year. The operators fed an average of 57 head for a 133 day feeding period. The cattle were steers and heifers of pr dominantly Hereford breeding. They gained a total of 279 pound in the feedlot at an average daily rate of 2. 1 pounds. The figures presented, {{with the exception of}} actual a rage, represent practical ranges of costs, receipt, and returns. All are based on 1953 - 54 prices. You will need to adjust prices to current levels when making any estimate based on the study but you will b able to us the requirement for labor and feed unless your method of feeding or your ration is radically different from that commonly used in Utah. The report contains two part. The regular printed material can be read to understand the general relations as they occur. The data set off by the printer give detailed findings of the survey.

40|$|This {{study was}} done in order to analyze the {{fattening}} performance of Holstein cattle which are under Summer season conditions {{in the district of}} Silifke of Mersin province. A total of 56 head Holstein cattle which are in commercial cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>enterprise</b> doing intensive production were fattened by dividing them into lighter (G-I) and heavier (G-II) according to weights of per feeding. Initial weight, average daily live weight gain, finishing weight, live weights gain and feed conversion rate for G-I and G-II were 99. 03 ± 2. 32 and 205. 27 ± 5. 15, 1. 081 ± 0. 04 and 1. 108 ± 0. 04 g, 293. 68 ± 5. 74 and 404. 64 ± 6. 95 and 194. 65, 199. 37 kg and 6. 8 and 7. 1 %, respectively. The cattles were put into the enterprise in April, 2010. Both groups separated from the enterprise {{at the end of the}} 180 days fattening. Independent t-test was used in order to determine whether there was a differentiation between groups. Differences between groups in terms of initial weight and finishing weight were significant (p 0. 01). As a result, it was found that initial weight in the daily live weight gain of Holstein cattle in Summer season conditions in the district of Silifke of Mersin province was not important also it was found that cattle were affected by the temperature and humidity, cattle fattening performance was subnormal and the performance could be increased by shower and fan application...|$|E
