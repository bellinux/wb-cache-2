5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E
5|$|The Parrett Navigation Act {{allowed the}} proprietors, of whom 25 were named, to raise £10,500 in shares and £3,300 by mortgage, {{with which to}} make {{improvements}} to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney. The River Isle, which joined the Parrett at Muchelney, was to be improved for its first mile, and then the Westport Canal was to be constructed from there to Westport. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney. An extra lock was added at Oath, when tests revealed that the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra £20,000 to be raised. The lock at Oath has since {{been replaced by a}} sluice gate to control flooding.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July 2012, the Expedition touched bottom at Isispynten, east of Nordaustlandet in the Arctic. Reports {{state that}} the ship was {{travelling}} at a low speed {{at the time and}} that nobody was ever in any danger. The ship freed itself under its own engine power and continued on its way.

25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at which the industry could operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|E
25|$|Echo {{sounding}} is {{a process}} {{used to determine the}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|E

40|$|Based on ihe {{analysis}} of 204 zooplankton {{samples from the}} stratified depths in the Indian ocean collected during the International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE), {{the distribution of the}} genus Pleuromamma, a Calanoid Copepod, was studied. Seven species, viz. Pleuromamma indica, P. gracilis P. piseki, P. abdominalis, P. borealis, P. xipias and P. quadrungulala, in the order of their abundance, and 1 variety of the genus P. abdominalis abyssal is were observed. Vertical distribution of species of Pleuromamma showed that they were inversely correlated with depth. Among the Pleuromamma species, P. indica could survive in an environment of low dissolved oxygen and lower <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> column, whereas P. xipias and P. abdominalis could survive in an environment of high dissolved oxygen and at almost all <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> column. Multiple regression {{analysis of}} the data suggested that light intensity, further depth stratification, seasonal variations, water currents and the interaction effects of temperature with dissolved oxygen and nutrients could provide a more pronounced prediction of the total abundance of the Pleuromamma species.

25|$|An {{important}} aspect of project design {{is likely to be}} managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale.

25|$|More growers {{entered the}} industry. The {{labour-intensive}} raft method {{was replaced with}} a modified Japanese longline system. Biodegradable stockings were packed with spat and tied to parallel rows of looped ropes, supported by buoys. Young mussels grow through the stockings, anchoring themselves to the ropes with their strong byssal threads (beards). The farms are usually located in sheltered or semi-sheltered areas where there is sufficient <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at low tide to keep the longline droppers off the bottom. Recent research has been investigating offshore mussel farming in exposed areas several kilometres from shore, such as farms offshore from Napier and Opotiki.|$|E
25|$|In mid-March, Farragut {{began moving}} his ships across {{the bar at}} the mouth of the river.

At least one ship that the Administration wanted in the expedition, USS Colorado, drew too much to get across. To Farragut, the most serious problem {{presented}} by the failed effort to bring Colorado into the river was not the reduction in the force he had available, but rather the lost time. With Colorado subtracted, the fleet inside the bar included six ships and twelve gunboats.|$|E

25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Weirs allow hydrologists and {{engineers}} a simple method of measuring the {{volumetric flow rate}} in small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since the geometry {{of the top of}} the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows {{over the top of the}} weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits/sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make flow measurement complicated, inaccurate or even impossible.|$|E
