5|$|There {{was little}} {{significant}} parliamentary representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants.

5|$|As Chief of the Air Staff at {{the onset}} of World WarII, Goble clashed with the Federal Government over {{implementation}} of the Empire Air Training Scheme, which he believed would be <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> the defence of Australia.

50|$|Since {{inflation}} targeting {{leads to}} lower and stable inflation rates, more improvement should then {{be given to}} the measurement of the consumer price index since few percentage points have greater repercussions when rates are low.

5|$|By 1910, {{the canal}} running through Rosendale had closed. On July5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house {{was hit by}} {{lightning}} and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased industrial use of Portland cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> Rosendale's economy, and the village lost almost 70percent of its population between 1900 and 1920; only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{showed that}} adding seductive details {{did not have}} the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> the learner's recall.

5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> the {{stability}} of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E

However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought that it had been a good measure in the past but had become <b>detrimental</b> <b>to</b> the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E

Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E

50|$|The {{substances}} in the toxic ejaculate {{that have been}} linked <b>to</b> <b>detrimental</b> effects <b>to</b> females are known as accessory gland proteins (Acps). Acps are found in male seminal fluid. After Acps are transferred to the female, they cause a change in her behavior and physiology. Studies have revealed that females who received Acps from males suffered decreased lifespan and fitness. Currently {{it has been estimated}} that there are more than 100 different Acps. Acp genes have been found in a variety of species and genera. Acps have been described as displaying a conservation function because they reserve protein biochemical classes within the seminal fluid.|$|R
