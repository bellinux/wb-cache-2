5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> sophisticated {{since the mid}} 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights. Detailed technical standards {{have been developed to}} ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency. The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights are among the most complex and interconnected in the world. By the second decade of the 21st century, there were over 1,200 international airports and almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> concerned about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E
5|$|The simpler {{roots of}} designs in Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. Designs, in general, <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws {{inspiration from the}} Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated he wishes for Pokémon design {{to return to the}} simpler roots of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{conservative}} in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, people <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{concerned}} about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E

5|$|The 2005 Texas vs. Ohio State {{football}} game, played September 10, 2005, was {{the first-ever}} meeting between The University of Texas at Austin and The Ohio State University {{in a college}} football game. The two teams came into the game ranked No. 2 and No. 4, respectively. It was the second game of the 2005 season for both teams. Schools <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> conservative in scheduling non-conference opponents of a high caliber, so a meeting of two top-five teams in the country was unusual {{this early in the}} season. For either team, winning the game would boost their chances of ultimately playing in the BCS National Championship Game while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes.|$|E
5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E

5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> better at emulating it.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole.

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{acquisitions}} <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult for the}} National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – {{and even more so}} for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period would have been impossible without the major public appeals backing them, including The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist by Leonardo da Vinci (bought in 1962) and Titian’s Death of Actaeon (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, indigenous populations <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E
