She said that the show hopefully would make a dialogue with viewers and ask themselves if they [...] "believe in your government? Whose point of view <b>is</b> <b>right?</b> <b>There</b> is a border between justice and crime.", hence the show's title.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{critics call}} Fear and Loathing Thompson's {{crowning}} achievement in gonzo journalism. For example, {{journalist and author}} Mikal Gilmore said the novel [...] "feels free wheeling when you read it [...] it doesn't feel accidental. The writing <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> on the page — startling, unprecedented and brilliantly crafted". Critics believe that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{should be considered a}} work of gonzo journalism because the characteristics of gonzo journalism are all characteristics seen in the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... {{features}} dialogue-driven interludes in {{the beginning}} of several tracks with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah conversing about money, life, crime, and hip hop, among other things. The introduction to [...] "Glaciers of Ice," [...] for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of dyeing Wallabee-styled Clarks. In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained [...] "We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks. The dyeing was something I was doing already. I'm an inventor. Niggas can't fuck with me when it comes to style. Only nigga that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> with me is probably Slick Rick. Other than that, I'm boss." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out to me}} that many [...] protesters are non-white and/or [...] "communists." [...] Well my answer to that is: [...] "Who cares?!" [...] They are against the same evil, corrupted, {{degenerate}} capitalist elitists that we are against! ...Seriously people, just who is our enemy? [...] The unemployed left-wing 25-year-old holding up a sign, or the Judeo-capitalist banksters who swindled the American taxpayers out of a trillion dollars in the [...] "bailout" [...] scam and continue to oppress the white working class?!? ... We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it – only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ... My heart <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> with these people, perhaps someday the [...] "movement" [...] will show the same courage and dedication that these people out there fighting are showing! ...|$|E

The {{crime has been}} but too common--the Scots crown-lawyers think it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> should be an example. Then the late {{disorders}} in Edinburgh have excited a prejudice in government against the nation at large, which they think can only be managed by measures of intimidation and severity. What argument have you, my poor girl, except the warmth of your sisterly affection, to offer against all this?--What is your interest?--What friends have you at court?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it's foolish, and it isn't that I don't trust you. I {{know that}} the son of your father couldn't do {{anything}} that was not honourable.

60|$|April 23.--A cold blustering day--bad welcome for {{the poor}} lambs. I made my walk short and my task long, my work turning entirely on the History--all on speculation. But the post brought me a letter from Dr. Lardner, {{the manager of the}} Cyclopædia, agreeing to my terms; so all <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> and no labour thrown away. The volume is to run to 400 pages; so much the better; I love elbow-room, and will have space to do {{something}} to purpose. I replied agreeing to his terms, and will send him copy as soon as I have corrected it. The Colonel and Miss Ferguson dined with us. I think I drank rather a cheerful glass with my good friend. Smoked an extra cigar, so no more at present.|$|E

It has been one of my chief wishes to have things {{straight}} with Philip, ever since the time he stayed at Redclyffe as a boy. I saw his superiority then; but it fretted me, and I never could make a companion of him. Ever since, I have looked to his approval {{as one of the best}} things to be won. It shows his ascendancy of character; yet, do what I will, the mist has gone on thickening between us; and with reason, for I have never been able to give him the confidence he required, and his conduct about my uncle has so tried my patience, that I never have been quite sure whether I ought to avoid him or not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is always}} very civil," [...] the {{lieutenant}} muttered to himself; [...] "in fact, wonderfully civil and hospitable, and all that. Still I never feel quite at my ease with him. If I {{had been a}} rich man, {{and they had been}} hard up, I should have certainly suspected there was a design in his invitations, and that he wanted me to marry Margaret; but, of course, that is absurd. He can't tell that I have a penny beyond my pay; and a girl like Margaret might marry any one she liked, at any rate out of Devonshire. Perhaps he may not have liked the idea of her marrying this cousin of hers; and no doubt he <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> and seeing, as I daresay he did see, that I was taken with Margaret, he thought it better to give me a chance than to let her marry Mervyn.|$|E
60|$|I beg you to {{remember}} these words. If you believe the Bible to be inspired, you are bound to take its words as they stand. And therefore I beg you {{to remember}} that St. Paul preached not about UNrighteousness, but righteousness; not about INtemperance, but about temperance; not about hell, but about judgment to come; in a word, not about wrong, but about right. I hope that {{does not seem to}} you a small matter. I hope that none of you are ready to say, 'It comes to the same thing in the end.' It does not come to the same thing. There is no use in telling a man what is wrong, unless you first tell him what <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> is no use rebuking a man for being bad, unless you first tell him how he may become better, and give him hope for himself, or you will only drive him to recklessness and despair. You must show him the right road, before you can complain of him for going the wrong one.|$|E
