The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

This tale of sweet revenge is a rare genial comedy". He appreciated its casting and screenplay, cinematography, editing and music, praising the performances of Faasil and other cast members and calling the film [...] "visually appealing". Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com gave the film three out of five stars, praising Faasil's performance and its narrative style: [...] "The plot is driven by characters and their reactions to a particular situation, {{and there is no}} solid form of story where we see a growth in characters or logical progression in the story".|$|E

The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show to be sort of small and comfortable... so I thought we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E

500|$|The Purple warrior ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a trophy}} {{awarded to the}} most {{distinguished}} player in the past year. The winner of the trophy is decided by {{a vote on the}} official website of the club, where <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> participate. The voting starts {{at the end of the}} year and is usually finished in a month. To be eligible to participate in a poll, a player must appear for the club in at least 10 official matches. The voting was first introduced at the end of 2007–08 season, with Czech defender Lubomir Kubica selected as the first ever trophy winner. Defender Elvedin Džinić was the first domestic player that won the award. Between 2007 and 2011 the voting was conducted during the summer and awarded to the best player of the past season, however, the trophy for the season 2011–12 was not awarded. Instead, the club had decided to prolong the voting and award the trophy to the most distinguished player of the past full year (from January until December). Marcos Tavares was awarded the award five times, all in successive years.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} in the United States and Puerto Rico in February 2000. It became very successful with the ballad and tropical and salsa versions setting an airplay record for a Latin single with 23.4 million impressions in those countries. The reaction to the song was intense, and Son by Four was asked to record an English-language version of the track. This version, titled [...] "Purest of Pain", was serviced to English-speaking radio stations in May 2000. The success of the song took by surprise {{the leader of the}} band, Ángel López, who told Billboard magazine: [...] "When they told us {{we were going to be}} signed by Columbia for the single, we flipped." [...] A ranchera version was also recorded for the Regional Mexican audience. About the song, López also declared that [...] "has something <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> relate to. We're adults, we've been all through that [...] The way the song reaches out to people is outstanding." [...] In his album review for AllMusic, Evan C. Gutierrez declared that [...] "A Puro Dolor" [...] set [...] "an impossibly high standard for the rest of the playlist." ...|$|E
500|$|Tong's {{character}} Chao {{has drawn}} mixed reception, often being mistaken {{as a real}} person.

Gabriella Nomura of The Vancouver Sun has branded Chao as [...] "a breath of politically incorrect fresh air", while Kevin Tang of Amped Asia has called him [...] "racist, sexist, vulgar, and self-deprecating" [...] but also [...] "one of the most funny Youtube celebrities". a-Tunes.net said that Chao's blackface performance, a mockery of African American people, had [...] "crossed the line". However, viewership has been positive. The [...] "Canton Style" [...] music video– a parody of Korean singer-rapper Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style"– amassed 1.1 million views within three days of its uploading. Another of Tong's uploads, [...] "Chinese Guy Eats Sooo Loud!" [...] has close to 2 million hits. His videos are, as of 2011, the number one and two most watched in Canada. Tong has said, in response to audience comments that his performances are [...] "racist", that everything is [...] "done for comedy. I'm not really racist against anybody.

500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees {{would have been just}} as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way they go about it, they're the best in the game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] {{is the best in the}} East." [...] Rivera, however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Beautiful" [...] {{was directed by}} Jonas Åkerlund and premiered on December 9, 2002. It opens with Aguilera speaking the line [...] "Don't look at me", followed by scenes of her singing alone in a room intercut with self-image-related sequences of other people. An anorexic girl examines herself in a mirror, eventually punching through it; a thin teenage boy stands lifting weights in a room plastered with images of bodybuilders; and an African-American girl rips out pages of women's magazines including photos of only white women and throws them into a fire. In one sequence, a girl is physically bullied by several peers, and in another, a goth man sits {{at the back of}} a bus while several people get up and move. The video also touches on LGBT issues; one scene features a gay couple, portrayed by Jordan Shannon and Justin Croft, kissing on a bench and ignoring the stares of people who pass them. Another shows a transgender person, played by Robert Sherman, putting on makeup, a wig, and women's clothing. The music video debuted at number 2 on Total Request Live, spending a total of fifty days on the chart and retiring at number 6. It topped MuchMusic's Countdown for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for fifteen weeks. The video received a Special Recognition award, presented by David LaChapelle, from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation at its 14th GLAAD Media Awards. After an a cappella performance of the song, Aguilera stated in her acceptance speech that [...] "this song is definitely a universal message that <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> relate to– anyone that's been discriminated against or unaccepted, unappreciated or disrespected just because of who you are." ...|$|E
500|$|During Kariya's second season, he {{was chosen}} {{to play for the}} Western Conference in the 1996 All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, in January 1996, he was ranked 14th in League scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games. He later {{replaced}} the injured Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks on the West's starting lineup. Kariya scored a goal and an assist for the Western Conference in a 5–4 loss to the Eastern Conference. Less than a month after the All-Star Game, the Mighty Ducks acquired Finnish winger Teemu Selänne in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets. Despite Kariya's efforts, the Ducks were low-scoring as a team; the deal was designed to give Kariya offensive support. Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul had {{a lot of pressure on}} him...He singlehandedly won some games for us this year...Now that we have Teemu, there's no way <b>everybody</b> <b>can</b> just key on Paul." [...] Selänne was immediately placed on Kariya's line; centred by Rucchin, the two wingers formed one of the League's most high-scoring duos for several seasons. In the last month of the 1995–96 campaign, Kariya achieved the 100-point single-season mark with a goal and three assists in a 5–3 win against the San Jose Sharks on April 7, 1996. A week later, he became the 14th-youngest NHL player to register 50 goals in one season, scoring twice in the final game of the campaign, a 5–2 win over Winnipeg. With seven goals and seven assists over the final seven games of the season, Kariya was named NHL Player of the Month for April. He finished the season with 50 goals and 58 assists for 108 points, tying him with Selänne for seventh overall in NHL scoring. His three overtime goals set a team record. With 20 penalty minutes over 82 games, Kariya won the Lady Byng Trophy as the League's most gentlemanly player and was also named to the season-ending NHL First All-Star Team. Following the addition of Selänne, the Mighty Ducks pushed for a playoff spot, winning 12 of their final 15 games, but finished the season ninth place in the West (the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs); they had an equal 78 points to the eighth-ranked Jets, but finished a spot below them by virtue of having fewer wins.|$|E
