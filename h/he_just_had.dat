500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Winwood recalled, [...] "There were no chord sheets, no nothing. [...] He [...] {{just started}} playing. [...] It was a one-take job, with him singing and {{playing at the}} same time. [...] <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> such mastery of the {{instrument}} and {{he knew what he}} was and knew his abilities". [...] Engineer Eddie Kramer saw it differently: [...] "The idea that these jam sessions were informal is something that I completely disagree with. [...] They may have seemed casual to the outside observer, but Jimi plotted and planned out nearly all of them. [...] He'd reason that if he had his songs together, if he really wanted to pull out what he heard in his head, he needed the right people... and that's what he did". [...] During the recording session, Hendrix is heard advising Winwood on his organ part.|$|E
2500|$|With Farnham, Little River Band {{recorded}} three studio albums, {{which had}} modest success – {{not enough to}} pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, The Net, was already written and Farnham had no say in the songs, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to record his lead vocals.

2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face {{as if he had just}} come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher {{he lived}} with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: [...] "Basically {{it came down to}} this: she was a {{well-balanced}} woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." [...] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as [...] " [...] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" [...] but claims {{towards the end of the}} relationship he became [...] "insufferable– classically conceited– the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had [...] "little understanding of polite society" [...] and she found him a turn-off, she says, [...] "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Authorities believe Ruffo {{still has}} access to {{substantial}} overseas financial resources, which could be aiding him {{in his ability to}} stay off-the-grid and assume a new identity. Chief Deputy US Marshall John Bolen commented in 2013, [...] "Having been sentenced to 220 months of incarceration and not serving a single day of that kind of sticks in the craw of those of us in this profession. His actions are a mockery to our justice system. We are {{the best in the world}} at this. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to make one mistake. We can make many but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to make one. We'll catch him". In 2007, Ruffo's last attorney, Jeffery Lichtman, offered the following when asked if he thought authorities would ever capture his former client: [...] "I think if I had to be a betting man, I'd put my money on John Ruffo. Because from what I can see so far, he is smarter than the people looking for him." ...|$|R
