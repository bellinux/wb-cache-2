500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (1) Be objective. The first {{prerequisite}} to a swindle {{is to be}} objective enough to realize early on {{when you have a}} lost position and start playing for a swindle while your position still has resources. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> until your position worsens and becomes hopeless, it will be too late.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{think you}} had better let me finish the job, sir,” he said. “You’d be more {{comfortable}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> quietly on board until we brought up the case.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you?" [...] {{she asked}} once more. [...] "Can you dive {{when they come}} too close? Otherwise you could not escape <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> here until I reached the bottom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't private," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{particularly}} want Mr. Fenn {{to tell me}} something, and as you know, he is peculiar. Perhaps, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind, {{it would}} be better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> for me downstairs." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "They {{are sending}} another 3,000 Blue Helmets {{and you are}} applauding. You are mistaken! We will not accept outsiders coming in to provide {{security}} for us here. Either you help us in the revolution or you keep quiet with MONUC. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for MONUC to bring you peace, you can wait forever." [...] — Laurent Nkunda, rebel general ...|$|E
2500|$|While rebel troops did {{abide by}} the {{temporary}} ceasefire, Nkunda spoke to a crowd of 1,500 in a stadium in the rebel-held town of Rutshuru {{to tell them to}} reject the recent deployment of 3,000 more peacekeepers. He stated, [...] "They are sending another 3,000 Blue Helmets and you are applauding. You are mistaken! We will not accept outsiders coming in to provide security for us here. Either you help us in the revolution or you keep quiet with MONUC. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for MONUC to bring you peace, you can wait forever." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am now to pray your lordship," [...] said Wayland, [...] "to dispose {{yourself}} to rest as commodiously as you can; and of you, gentlemen, {{to remain as}} still and mute as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> at your mother's deathbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to me," [...] he muttered, [...] "that there's {{been some}} trouble here. I {{shall have to}} take a liberty. If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Rheinholdt, I think it would be better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> in the car until I send out for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} had your {{say it would be}} better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> until after supper," [...] he said. [...] "You see, one thing at one time is quite enough for Harry, and he really isn't in the least uncivil when you {{understand}} him. Still, it's no use trying to make him listen when he doesn't want to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's here. It's {{coming this}} way, both of them. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait,</b> you'll {{see it for}} yourselves. I'm not joking; it's the real thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Phoebe, Phoebe! {{you will}} never get married <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for a philosopher. Your papa would never like a very clever genius or an author.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty pounds," [...] {{repeated}} Miss Vickers, [...] "or {{four hundred}} shillings, {{if you like}} it better. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> a moment I’ll make it pennies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear reason, Jack. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> like a {{rational}} and patient man, instead of rushing blindfold on your ruin, something may be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She might," [...] said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; [...] "though she's only {{a visitor}} here. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> a minute, Bathsheba will be in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're good at {{trailing}} or they'd {{have taken}} fright," [...] she said. [...] "Still, I think I will surprise <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a most {{interesting}} case," [...] cried Miss Winthrop; [...] "and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> till I fetch my camera, I’ll take your portrait together {{just as you}} are." ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned away, feeling {{sick and}} faint; and the Doctor went on. [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> {{for it with}} impatience, judge, if you please, what HIS eagerness will be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good afternoon. I {{have been}} talking to Sam Fisher. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait,</b> you will see him passing away down the drive. He is leaving the house. I am coming back.' ...|$|E
60|$|FRANK [folding his note] She {{must see}} <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> [very expressively] <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> til she comes in.|$|R
2500|$|Commenting on {{fighting}} the young Ali, George Chuvalo said: [...] "He {{was just so}} damn fast. When he was young, he moved his legs and hands at the same time. He threw his punches {{when he was in}} motion. He'd be out of punching range, and as he moved into range he'd already begun to throw the punch. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>waited</b> until he got into range to punch back, he beat you every time." ...|$|R
6000|$|The page {{nodded and}} Walters gave him twenty-five cents. [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>wait</b> a little, I'll {{have a message}} to send; it will save you a journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so sorry," [...] she continued, [...] "that I've {{nothing in}} the house to offer you. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> a minute I'll send round to Fogarty's at the corner." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we’ve got {{a little}} {{business}} to talk about," [...] said Boom confidentially; [...] "but we sha’n’t be long. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> here, Dick, we’ll see you when we come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comfort yourself, then; for two {{candidates}} for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the king--young nobles both--and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> but <b>wait</b> where <b>you</b> are {{you will hear}} them questioned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{leave you}} here. You are not fit for further adventures to-night. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait,</b> one or other {{of us will}} go back with you to the Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunty, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> a minute, we'll pitch yours for you," [...] said Demi, {{feeling that}} Mrs. Bhaer's favor {{must not be}} lost again by any neglect of theirs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{things will}} spoil <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> too long, sir. The {{mistress}} was very particular {{with me and}} cook about it." [...] And Armande, {{with an air of}} declining further responsibility, went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon I can, sonny. I live in {{the next}} district. Want to go there? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> till evening, I {{can give you a}} lift part of the way. It's five miles out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't hear it now, sir," [...] the man said. [...] "I {{think it}} came down on a puff of wind.. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> {{a minute or two}} I think you will hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I spoke unguardedly, sir, but I am very tired. Still, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>wait</b> a few minutes, I {{will get}} the horses out without troubling the hired man." ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth nodded full concurrence. [...] "It {{would be}} a little {{difficult}} to imagine it commencing very much worse. Wouldn't it have been wiser <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>waited</b> a little longer, Harry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hug Frank," [...] he said; [...] "don't hug me. I haven't {{done with}} you yet; when I have, you may {{shake hands with}} me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like. <b>Wait,</b> and compose yourself." ...|$|R
