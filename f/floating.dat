Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. The key of the fast inverse square root was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the square root with another method and calculating the reciprocal via <b>floating</b> point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit <b>floating</b> point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other <b>floating</b> point specifications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Plastic <b>floats</b> from fishing nets are {{commonly}} found {{washed up on}} beaches in southern Brazil. They are usually broken and show signs of having been repaired. Characteristics of <b>floats</b> and interviews with fishermen suggest two main causes of <b>float</b> loss. First, collisions between active gear, bottom trawl nets for shrimp, and passive gear, drift nets for fish, destroy nets and release fragments of them, including <b>floats.</b> Second, the difficulty with which <b>floats</b> are inserted on the <b>float</b> rope of the nets when they are used near the surface. <b>Floats</b> are inserted to replace damaged or lost <b>floats,</b> {{or they may be}} removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. <b>Floats</b> may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost.

For both magnetic and mechanical <b>float</b> level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the <b>float.</b> For example, larger <b>floats</b> may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of <b>float</b> material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|R
5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive.

Sweden's <b>floating</b> rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity.
