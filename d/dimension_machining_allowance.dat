Inclination of technological surfaces, their flatness error {{as well as}} positioning of the workpiece on the machine tool have been taking into account. The minimal values of allowances are calculated based on the acquired cloud of points representing the surface, which is subsequently substituted with plane according to 3 D least square method. Flatness error is calculated and used for determining the value of allowance on single surface by vector analysis. Minimization of volume to be machined by implementing genetic algorithm is presented. Minimal allowances obtained by the method constitute the constraints for further minimization of removed volume.

In this paper, a novel real-time measuring technology is developed for non-contact measuring the deformation behavior of heavy steel castings in heat treatment process. It was employed to measure the distortion and the temperature field of a batch of heavy turbine blade castings at cooling stage in normalizing process. Three inflection points appear in the distortion-time curves, and the residual distortion is affected by the regional area of not finished martensite transformation when the second inflection point appears. When the mean air temperature falls into the range of 10 °C- 20 °C, the residual distortion is small; when it is lower than 10 °C, positive distortion appears; when it is higher than 20 °C, negative distortion appears.

The less measured points {{are divided into}} different segments by the key geometric points and throat points which are defined according to design concepts.

40|$|AbstractHot forged parts {{characterized}} by thin sections may suffer geometric distortions during the cooling phase that force the process designers {{to work with}} significant <b>machining</b> <b>allowances.</b> The correct identification of the such defects during the process design might allow the proper set of the process parameters for their compensation and, therefore, {{the reduction of the}} <b>allowances</b> and the <b>machining</b> steps. The early computation of such distortions can be fulfilled by using thermal-mechanical-metallurgical models of both the forging and cooling phases, which must be calibrated through extensive experimental campaigns, involving both laboratory experiments and on-field measurements during industrial production. The paper presents a coupled experimental and numerical approach to predict the geometrical distortions of turbine blades in martensitic stainless steel. The presented approach comprises both the development of the numerical models of the forging and cooling phases and their calibration using accurate material data.

40|$|Casting {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} metal-shaping methods known to human being. It generally means pouring molten metal into a refractory mold with a cavity of the shape to be made, and allowing it to solidify. When solidified, the desired metal object is taken out from the refractory mold either by breaking the mold or by taking mold apart. This process is also called founding. A pattern is a replica of the object to be made by the casting process, with some modifications. The main modifications are addition of pattern allowances like shrinkage <b>allowance,</b> <b>machining</b> <b>allowance,</b> draft allowance etc., the provision of core prints and elimination of fine details. Loose piece pattern is used when the contour of the part is such that withdrawing the pattern from the mold is not possible. Hence during molding, the obstructing part of the contour is held as a loos piece by a wire. After molding is over, first the main pattern is removed and then the loose pieces are recovered through the gap generated by the main pattern. A safety valve which is generally manufactured by complex forging method, can be easily manufactured by sand casting method which is more economical the forging method. In the sand casting method, the two wedge shaped portions of the safety valve create problem during removal of pattern, so these two portions are taken as loose pieces and held as loose pieces by a wire or pin. Once the main pattern body is removed, these loose pieces are recovered through the space vacated by main pattern body. So this project work deals with manufacturing of safety valve using sand casting with split pattern which consists of multi loose pieces (combined loose piece) and its advantages over complex forging metho...|$|R
