5|$|Weiquan {{lawyers have}} also {{challenged}} {{the application of}} state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues. In November 2009, for instance, lawyers were involved <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> for Huang Qi, a Sichuan activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims. Huang was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison for possession of state secrets.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of Goofus and Gallant have {{also appeared in}} contexts divorced from the comic. Philosopher Theodore Sider used the characters in an argument against {{the notion of a}} binary Heaven or Hell conception of the afterlife. Sider conceived of Goofus and Gallant as near-equals, with Gallant only marginally better than Goofus, <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is antithetical to God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and Gallant as archetypes of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E

25|$|Jared Diamond, <b>in</b> , <b>argues</b> that {{cultures}} self-limit {{when they}} exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment, and {{the consumption of}} strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.|$|R
5|$|Twin Books {{appealed the}} decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{reversed}} the original decision, {{stating that the}} novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country's public domain when published, therefore the original publication date {{could not be used}} <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. As such, Anna Wyler's renewal was timely and valid, thereby upholding Twin Books' ownership of the copyright.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric against them <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> for a diplomatic solution, noting {{that if the}} new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E

50|$|The text survives in {{only one}} manuscript, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 139. In its {{surviving}} form, it was written down between 1161 and 1167. The manuscript was at Sawley Abbey, Lancashire by the late 12th century. Derek Baker <b>in</b> 1975 <b>argued</b> that it was probably compiled at Fountains Abbey. M. R. James had <b>argued</b> <b>in</b> 1912 that the manuscript was compiled at Hexham, Northumberland. Theodor Mommsen in 1898, Peter Hunter Blair in 1963 and David Dumville in 1974 (repeated <b>in</b> 1990) <b>argued</b> that the compilation took place at Sawley.|$|R

25|$|The Roman centurion Cornelius of Caesarea Maritima is {{traditionally}} considered the first Gentile convert. His conversion, as documented in , carries great significance.

He differed from his collaborators <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> that the genetic heritability of schizophrenia was lower than typically estimated. A review of Torrey's data analysis, however, suggested he had erroneously compared different sorts of concordance statistics.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined how}} change in minority size influenced information processing and attitude change. Experiment 1 showed that when strong rather than weak arguments were presented, a message attributed to an expanding rather than shrinking minority elicited more issue-relevant thoughts and more related attitude change <b>in</b> the <b>argued</b> direction. Experiment 2 showed more related attitude change <b>in</b> the <b>argued</b> direction {{when it was}} unlikely that expanding size was due to the shifting majority members' self-interest. Experiment 3 replicated these findings. In addition, results indicated that change in size interacted differently with the majority than with minority status of the source: related issues remained largely unaffected in the case of majority support, whereas expanding minorities elicited more related attitude change <b>in</b> the <b>argued</b> direction...|$|R
25|$|In November 1769, the Portolá {{expedition}} discovered San Francisco Bay {{before returning}} to San Diego.

25|$|Pinker follows Chomsky <b>in</b> <b>arguing</b> {{that the}} fact that {{children}} can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called spandrel. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.|$|E
