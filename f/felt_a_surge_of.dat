Eadie reported that she first felt herself fading to lifelessness, then <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> energy followed by a [...] "pop" [...] and feeling of release, a sense of freedom and movement unhindered by inertia or gravity. She was met by three angelic beings who spoke with her about her prior existence and hitherto suppressed memories in order to participate in earthly experience. She traveled to terrestrial locations such as her home merely by thinking about them, returned to her hospital, and then passed on through a dark tunnel-like medium in which she reported sensing other beings in a transitory preparatory stage.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} {{circumstance}} eased {{its grip on}} him. As he started {{to come out of}} the tent he saw a huge bull-moose crossing the swale some four hundred yards away. Morganson <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> and bound <b>of</b> the blood in him, and then went unaccountably weak. A nausea overpowered him, and he was compelled to sit down a moment to recover. Then he reached for his rifle and took careful aim. The first shot was a hit: he knew it; but the moose turned and broke for the wooded hillside that came down to the swale. Morganson pumped bullets wildly among the trees and brush at the fleeing animal, until it dawned upon him that he was exhausting the ammunition he needed for the sled-load of life for which he waited.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, the man {{reached in}} his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp {{rustling}} as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended {{to put him in}} a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> great <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.|$|R
5000|$|Kelly was {{subsequently}} caught {{and sent to}} jail in 2000, where an Afghan introduced him to Islam. Khalid Kelly, as he was later known, left prison a convert. Kelly recalls: [...] "I got really good at making drink. I had three stills in my house and then I got arrested one day with five cases of Johnny Walker {{in the back of}} my car. I was sent to prison for eight months. I lost everything. It was all confiscated. The prison was 150 people in a dormitory with a mosque at the end. I’d been inside for four weeks and was at my lowest point when I was given the Koran in English. Someone explained it to me. And then it was very quick. I saw that God was the creator, the provider, the commander, and the legislator for mankind. It was all suddenly very clear. I felt freer than I had ever been - even though I was in prison." [...] Kelly also said of this event: [...] "It just filled in all the gaps, you know? It was like the answer to everything I'd every wondered about. There was even a Captain Ali there at the prison, and he gave me a Koran. And I'll always remember it because he wrapped it in a piece of newspaper, you know, because he didn't have any wrapping paper. And he was so happy for me. He was nearly crying, the man." [...] He said, [...] "'I'm so happy you've come to the truth. It will change your life.' And indeed it did", he says. Describing his journey from scepticism to belief, or as he called it “from darkness to light”, Kelly said, “the journey started with the illegal production of alcoholic drinks in Saudi Arabia whilst I was working as a nurse at the King Faisal hospital.” He went on to say: “Before Islam, I didn’t know the meaning of love. I used to be like other British young men, drinking and going out, but when I read the Quran in 2000, whilst in jail, I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> compassion and sympathy. I feel now that what led me to Islam was God’s mercy and sympathy. It’s something bigger than myself and I can’t explain it with words.” ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the hypothesis that the rate (dose/time) at which oestradiol- 17 =boestradiol) is presented to the hypothalamo=n- influences secretion of LH, FSH and prolactin. A computer-controlled infusion system was used to produce linearly increasing serum concentrations of oestradiol in ovari-ectomized ewes over a period of 60 h. Serum samples were collected from ewes every 2 h from 8 h before to 92 h after start of infusion, and assayed for oestradiol, LH, FSH and prolactin. Rates of oestradiol increase were categorized into high (0 =. 1 =n-=. 8 pg/h), medium (0 =. 3 =n-=. 0 pg/h) and low (0 =. 1 =n-=. 2 pg/h). Ewes receiving high rates of oestra-diol (N = 11) responded with <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> LH 12 =. =+-=. h after oestradiol began to increase, whereas ewes receiving medium (N = 15) and low (N = 11) rates of oestra-diol responded with <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> LH at 19 =. =+-=. and 30 =. =+-=. h, respectively. None <b>of</b> the <b>surges</b> <b>of</b> LH was accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> FSH. Serum concentrations of FSH decreased and prolactin increased in ewes receiving high and medium rates of oestra-diol, when compared to saline-infused ewes (N = 8; P < 0 =. 5). We conclude that rate of increase in serum concentrations of oestradiol controls the time <b>of</b> the <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> LH and secretion of prolactin and FSH in ovariectomized ewes. We also suggest that the mechanism by which oestradiol induces <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> LH may be different from the mechanism by which oestradiol induces <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> FSH...|$|R
