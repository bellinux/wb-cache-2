5|$|But at {{that same}} moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E

5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to make it as hyper real as <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E

5|$|In many {{instances}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have made the}} incidents more dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, the desire of exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not avoid}} being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

6000|$|He paused again, as if {{expecting me}} to say something. After the words he had just spoken, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> say? what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> think? ...|$|R

25|$|I {{felt that}} air {{was forced into}} my mouth, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not speak and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not close my mouth. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times I {{feel that there is}} food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E
25|$|Undoubtedly, you Orleanians {{think of}} me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pay a visit to your city every night. At will <b>I</b> <b>could</b> slay {{thousands}} of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.|$|E
25|$|I {{have given}} such {{descriptions}} of engines for wheel carriages as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do in the}} time and space <b>I</b> <b>could</b> allow myself; {{but it is very}} defective and can only serve to keep other people from similar patents.|$|E
60|$|What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> tell Ortheris {{anything}} {{that he did not}} know of the pleasures of his life? I was not a Chaplain nor a Subaltern, and Ortheris had a right to speak as he thought fit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where am I to go?" [...] {{he asked}} helplessly, {{and held out}} the {{envelope}} with a gesture; [...] "and what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? Even if <b>I</b> knew-- How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> leave the gardens?" ...|$|R

25|$|When Dr Johnson and I were by {{ourselves}} at night, I observed of our host, aspectum generosum habet. Et generosum animum, he added. For {{fear of being}} overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, and with {{as much of the}} English accent as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> assume, {{so as not to be}} understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> halted. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> {{explain my}} idealism to this man? How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> put into speech a {{something}} felt, a {{something like the}} strains of music heard in sleep, a something that convinced yet transcended utterance? ...|$|R

25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make the film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not. You will not believe this, {{but the day}} the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish she}} <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> wish she <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> wish she could." [...] As he {{repeated}} the words over and over again, there was an eagerness in his voice that filled Mrs Dale's heart with tenderness towards him.|$|R
