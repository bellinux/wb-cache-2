25|$|A {{majority}} of state courts, {{including those of}} Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin, have ruled that the <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> <b>treasure</b> trove is entitled to it. The {{theory is that the}} English monarch's claim to treasure trove was based on a statutory enactment which replaced the finder's original right. When this statute was not re-enacted in the United States after its independence, the right to treasure trove reverted to the finder.|$|E
50|$|The monies in {{the piano}} are includable as gross income for three reasons. First, an IRS Revenue Ruling states, “the <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> <b>treasure</b> trove is in receipt of taxable income, for Federal income tax purposes, {{to the extent}} of its value in United States currency, for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.” Second, {{numerous}} Supreme Court cases recognize the broad sweeping construction of Section 61(a) found in Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.61-1(a). Third, other courts and commentators have taken the position that windfalls, including found monies, were properly includable in gross income under Section 22(a) of the 1939 Code, which is the predecessor of Section 61(a) in the 1954/1986 Code. Plaintiffs were unable to point to any inconsistencies between the gross income sections of the Code, the interpretation of them by the regulations and the courts, and the revenue rulings. Thus, the monies found in the piano constituted gross income.|$|E

50|$|The monies were {{properly}} {{included as}} gross {{income for the}} calendar year of 1964. Problems of when title vests, or when possession is complete, {{as it relates to}} federal taxation {{and in the absence of}} definitive federal legislation, is determined by state law. Ohio does not have a statute dealing with the rights <b>of</b> owners and <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>treasure</b> trove, thus the English common-law rule applies. English common-law rule states that “title belongs to the finder as against all the world except the true owner.” Thus, Plaintiffs must have actually found the money to have superior title over all but the true owner. The $4,467.00 was not “reduced to undisputed possession” until actual discovery in 1964. Pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.61-14, “treasure trove, to the extent of its value in United States currency, constitutes gross income for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.” Therefore the United States is not barred by the statute of limitations from collecting the $836.51 in tax in 1964.|$|R
25|$|An {{interpretation}} of Roman law regarding treasure troves makes an {{appearance in the}} 13th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The Parable <b>of</b> the Hidden <b>Treasure</b> is told by Jesus of Nazareth to the crowds surrounding him and his disciples. In the parable, the treasure trove is hidden in a field, which is open country and anyone could conceivably discover something hidden in that location. It's also assumed that the present owner has no knowledge or memory <b>of</b> the <b>treasure.</b> The <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treasure</b> kept the trove secret until he could raise capital to purchase the land holding the trove. Selling all he had, the finder purchased the land and then unearthed the trove and, as the finder and owner, he was legally entitled to the entire trove. Jesus compared the kingdom of Heaven to the trove, being of greater value than all a person's earthly wealth and a wise investment that not everyone understands at first.|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value <b>of</b> the <b>treasure,</b> with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treasure.</b> He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|R
50|$|The Treasure Act 1996 is an Act of Parliament {{designed}} {{to deal with}} finds <b>of</b> <b>treasure</b> in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It legally obliges <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> objects which constitute a legally defined term <b>of</b> <b>treasure</b> to report their find to their local coroner within 14 days. An inquest led by the coroner then determines whether the find constitutes treasure or not. If it is declared to be treasure then the finder must offer the item for sale to a museum at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts known as the Treasure Valuation Committee. Only if a museum expresses {{no interest in the}} item, or is unable to purchase it, can the finder retain it.|$|R
