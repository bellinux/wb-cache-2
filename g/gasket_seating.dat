5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} concept {{underlying the}} improved sealability for constant seating stress gaskets are that (i) if the flange sealing surfaces {{are capable of}} attaining a seal, (ii) the sealing elements are compatible with the process fluid and application, and (iii) the sufficient <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> stress is achieved on installation necessary to affect a seal, then {{the possibility of the}} gasket leaking in-service is greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.|$|E
40|$|The three {{critical}} components within a bolted, flanged connection are the flanges, gasket, and bolts. Until recently, simplified flange assembly target torque values for ASME B 16. 5 flanges were routinely determined by considering {{just one or}} two of these primary components. One approach considers only the gasket. Gasket-based target torque values are selected to optimize the gasketâ€™s sealing performance by ensuring compression between minimum and maximum seating stress ranges, or based upon achieving specific levels of gasket Tightness (Tp). Another approach, fastener-based torque values, simply targets a specific bolt preload during assembly, typically some percentage of bolt material yield stress. A third approach optimizes <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> stress or tightness within the specific preload stress range o...|$|E

40|$|CANDU nulcear power system, the {{experimental}} work {{reported in this}} paper and {{the experimental}} data accumulated since this paper was prepared indicates that prudent design of spiral wound gasketted joints requires that the <b>gasket</b> be initially <b>seated</b> to a mean stress over the total contact area of about 18, 000 psi. The definitions and. values used in the Code equations are relatively unimportant provided this condition is satisfied and subsequent leakage performance is satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally a {{stone or}} foreign object will mar the <b>seat</b> <b>gasket.</b> In this case, most {{hydrants}} {{have a special}} seat wrench that allows removal of the seat to replace the gasket or other broken parts without removing the hydrant from the ground. Hydrant extensions are also available for raising a hydrant if the grade around the hydrant changes. Without extending the height, the wrenches to remove caps would not clear and the break flanges for traffic models would not be located correctly in case they were hit. Hydrant repair kits are also available to repair sacrificial parts designed to break when hit by a vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steel flanges are normally forged to form, {{as required by}} the ASTM A 182 /A 182 M standard, but may also potentially be machined directly from forged {{stainless steel}} bar. In order to evaluate the integrity of such flanges, axisymmetric elastic-plastic finite element models have been developed, considering static effects such as bolt load and internal pressure. Additionally, tensile testing of a sample forged bar (UNS S 31803) has been conducted. The stress distribution in a flange during <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> and operating conditions has been determined, as well as the degree of plastic strain caused by the bolt loads. The maximum stresses {{have been found to be}} around the same values as the minimum yield strength requirement of the studied material (UNS S 31803), and the location of the maximum stress concentrations have been identified as the gasket groove. The tensile tests of the forged bar (UNS S 31803) have shown that the yield and tensile strength properties are considerably higher than the standardized minimum requirements. The elastic modulus of the forged bar has also been determined, and was found to be lower than anticipated in the axisymmetric models. Some specimens have also been found to exhibit highly non-linear elastic properties. </p...|$|E
40|$|A multi-fiction {{corrosion}} {{monitoring system}} has been designed for installation into DST 241 -AN- 105 at the Hanford Site in fiscal year 1999. The 241 -AN- 105 system is the third-generation corrosion monitoring system described by TTP RLO- 8 -WT- 21. Improvements and upgrades from the second-generation system (installed in 241 -AN- 102) that have been incorporated into the third-generation system include: <b>Gasket</b> <b>seating</b> surfaces utilize O-rings instead of a washer type gasket for improved seal; Probe design contains an equally spaced array of 22 thermocouples; Probe design contains an adjustable verification thermocouple; Probe design contains three ports for pressure/gas sampling; Probe design contains one set of strain gauges to monitor probe flexure if flexure occurs; Probe utilizes an adjustable collar to allow depth adjustment of probe during installation; System is capable of periodically conducting LPR scans; System is housed in a climate controlled enclosure adjacent to the riser containing the probe; System uses wireless Ethernet links to send data to Hanford Local Area Network; System uses commercial remote access software to allow remote command and control; and Above ground wiring uses driven shields to reduce external electrostatic noise in the data. These new design features have transformed what was primarily a second-generation corrosion monitoring system into a multi-function tank monitoring system that adds {{a great deal of}} functionality to the probe, provides for {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between corrosion and other tank operating parameters, and optimizes the use of the riser that houses the probe in the tank...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed flanged joint design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium. The results of the individual tests and the combinations of load are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} methodology is proposed which aims at understanding {{the origin of}} a particular failure occurred in a two-cylinder high performance spark ignition engine for motorbike applications. A relevant cavitation damage/erosion has been detected at the water side of the engine cylinder liner during severe reliability bench tests, performed at the early stage of the engine design process. On the contrary, no damages have been registered during parallel high-load long runs of the motorbike. This contribution investigates in detail {{the differences between the}} bench test cooling circuit layout and the actual motorbike cooling circuit layout in order to find an explanation of the engine critical behaviour. In particular, CFD-CHT analyses of the water cooling jacket are performed, the computational domain covering both the coolant galleries and the surrounding metal components (head, block, <b>gasket,</b> valves, valve <b>seats,</b> valve guides, cylinder liner, spark plug). The contribution of a two-phase approach which takes into account the effect of a phase transition within the engine coolant is considered. Different engine operating conditions are investigated and a detailed analysis of different thermo-mechanical parameters influencing the engine behaviour is carried out. Results of the CFD simulations asses the methodology capability to correctly capture and understand the origin of the engine failure, thus providing a useful design tool for a faster and more effective design modification...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a combined experimental and numerical activity {{carried out to}} improve the accuracy of conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations of a high-performance S. I. motorbike engine water cooling jacket. The computational domain covers both the coolant jacket and the surrounding metal components (head, block, <b>gasket,</b> valves, valve <b>seats,</b> valve guides, cylinder liner, spark plug). In view {{of the complexity of}} the modeled geometry, particular care is required in order to find a tradeoff between the accuracy and the cost-effectiveness of the numerical procedure. The CFD-CHT simulation of water cooling jackets involves many complex physical phenomena: in order to setup a robust numerical procedure, the contribution of some relevant CFD parameters and sub-models was discussed by the authors in previous publications and is referred to [1 - 4]. Among the formers, the effects of a proper set of boundary conditions and a detailed representation of the physical properties of the involved materials were evaluated. Among the latter, the contribution of a two-phase approach taking into account the effects of phase transition within the engine coolant was considered. The CFD-CHT setup is now applied to investigate and understand the origin of a critical engine behavior occurring at the engine test bench under a severe reliability test. Additional sub-models are introduced and their impact on the results is discussed. Different engine operations are modeled and a detailed analysis of the many thermo-mechanical factors influencing the engine fatigue strength is carried out. At the end of the process, CFD simulations are able to correctly capture and understand the origin of the engine failure, thus leading to a faster and more effective design modification...|$|R
30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum <b>gasket</b> <b>seating</b> stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasnâ€™t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|E
