5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or <b>ground.</b> <b>Earth</b> is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry <b>ground,</b> <b>earth</b> tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> pin. It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> pin {{is longer than}} the line and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> pin enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|E
50|$|The Wenner {{method is}} {{the most widely used}} method for {{measuring}} soil resistivity for electrical <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> purposes.

25|$|In the {{vicinity}} of electrostatic sensitive devices, a <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> mat or grounding (earthing) mat is used to ground static electricity generated by people and moving equipment. There are two types used in static control: Static Dissipative Mats, and Conductive Mats.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electrical}} substation a <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> mat is a mesh of conductive material installed at places {{where a person}} would stand to operate a switch or other apparatus; it is bonded to the local supporting metal structure and to {{the handle of the}} switchgear, so that the operator will not be exposed to a high differential voltage due to a fault in the substation.|$|E

25|$|Residual current breaker with {{over-current}} protection (RCBO) — {{combines the}} functions of an RCD and an MCB in one package. In the United States and Canada, panel-mounted devices that combine <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> fault detection and over-current protection are called ground fault interrupter (GFI) breakers; a wall mounted outlet device or separately enclosed plug-in device providing ground fault detection and interruption only (no overload protection) is called a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI).|$|E
25|$|Unipolar - One {{end of the}} {{secondary}} winding is connected to a single high voltage terminal, the other end is grounded. This type is used in modern coils designed for entertainment. The primary winding is located near the bottom, low potential end of {{the secondary}}, to minimize arcs between the windings. Since the <b>ground</b> (<b>Earth)</b> serves as the return path for the high voltage, streamer arcs from the terminal tend to jump to any nearby grounded object.|$|E
25|$|Equipment bonding {{conductors}} {{provide a}} low impedance path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical <b>ground</b> (<b>earth).</b> (see Kirchhoff's circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together and to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical <b>ground</b> (<b>earth),</b> the equipment bonding conductor also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).|$|E

25|$|An RCD {{helps to}} protect against {{electric}} shock when current flows through a person from a phase (live / line / hot) to earth. It cannot protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from phase to neutral or from phase to phase, for example where a finger touches both live and neutral contacts in a light fitting; a device cannot differentiate between current flow through an intended load from flow through a person, though the RCD may still trip {{if the person is}} in contact with the <b>ground</b> (<b>earth),</b> as some current may still pass through the persons finger and body to earth.|$|E
25|$|The 5-15 socket is {{standard}} in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Panama. It {{is also used}} in Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and, as a legacy, parts of Brazil), Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. This socket is recommended in IEC standard 60906-2 for 120 volt 60Hz installations. Looking directly at a NEMA 5-15 socket in the commonly found orientation of <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> at the bottom, the neutral slot is on the left, and the line slot is on the right. However, in the US the National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specifies that the ground hole should be on top. Sideways installation is also permitted; in this case, NECA 130-2010 specifies the neutral (long) slot is on top.|$|E
25|$|The {{partners}} supplied {{their own}} tools; and {{were responsible for}} their upkeep. Many important responsibilities lay with the partners; thus, for instance, only two overseers were needed to manage more than 200 Leadhills’ miners. In {{the absence of an}} overseer’s constant and immediate personal supervision, the partners were totally responsible for their collective work practices and occupational safety; thus, the partners, rather than overseers, would decide how to act against threats posed by subterranean water, loose <b>ground,</b> <b>earth</b> tremors, etc. However, with no overseer, there was also no oversight; and, often, hastily constructed passages/shafts were misaligned with those of other teams, affecting the structure of the entire mine — also, the disposal of waste and rubbish from one team’s work area often impeded the progress of another team (or teams).|$|E
5000|$|Stray {{voltages}} {{created in}} <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> conductors by currents flowing {{in the supply}} utility neutral conductors can be troublesome. For example, special measures may be required in barns used for milking dairy cattle. Very small voltages, not usually perceptible to humans, may cause low milk yield, or even mastitis (inflammation of the udder).So-called [...] "tingle voltage filters" [...] may be required in the electrical distribution system for a milking parlour.|$|R
50|$|As {{the neutral}} point of an {{electrical}} supply system is often connected to <b>earth</b> <b>ground,</b> ground and neutral are closely related. Under certain conditions, a conductor used {{to connect to}} a system neutral is also used for <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> of equipment and structures. Current carried on a grounding conductor can result in objectionable or dangerous voltages appearing on equipment enclosures, so the installation of grounding conductors and neutral conductors is carefully defined in electrical regulations. Where a neutral conductor is used also to connect equipment enclosures to earth, {{care must be taken}} that the neutral conductor never rises to a high voltage with respect to local ground.|$|R
50|$|A large {{electrical}} room may have extensive provisions for <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> and bonding enclosures of electrical equipment to prevent stray voltage and danger of electric shock, even during faults in the electrical system. Lightning protection requires different measures than protection from power-frequency faults.

An {{access control system}} may control admission to the room.|$|R
2500|$|Equipment {{earthing}} conductors {{provide an}} electrical {{connection between the}} physical <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> and the grounding/bonding system, which connects (bonds) the normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment. According to the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC), the reason for doing this is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, and contact with higher voltage lines.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|E
2500|$|A static {{dissipative}} mat that {{rests on a}} conductive surface (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with {{static dissipative}} vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to <b>ground</b> (<b>earth).</b> For commercial uses, static dissipative rubber mats are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static dissipative layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a conductive rubber bottom. Conductive mats are made of carbon and used only on floors {{for the purpose of}} drawing static electricity to ground as quickly as possible. Normally conductive mats are made with cushioning for standing and are referred to as [...] "anti-fatigue" [...] mats.|$|E
50|$|Conductors of a {{three-phase}} system are usually identified by a color code, {{to allow for}} balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors. Colors used may adhere to International Standard IEC 60446 (now merged into IEC 60445), older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, different color codes are used for <b>grounded</b> (<b>earthed)</b> and ungrounded systems.|$|R
50|$|All scope probes {{contain some}} {{facility}} for <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> the probe to the circuit's reference voltage. This is usually accomplished by connecting {{a very short}} pigtail wire from the probe head to ground. Inductance in the ground wire can lead to distortion in the observed signal, so this wire is kept as short as possible. Some probes use a small ground foot instead of any wire, allowing the ground link to be as short as 10 mm.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding {{conductor}} for <b>grounding</b> (<b>earthing),</b> but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While metal conduit may sometimes be used as a grounding conductor, the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as grounding conductor may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|R
2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and resettable devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared. Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the return wire [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] (GEC) is used {{to connect}} the system {{grounded}} ("neutral") conductor, or the equipment to a grounding electrode, or a point on the grounding electrode system. This is called [...] "system grounding" [...] and most electrical systems are required to be grounded. The U.S. NEC and the UK's BS 7671 list systems that are required to be grounded. [...] According to the NEC, the purpose of connecting an electrical system to the physical <b>ground</b> (<b>earth)</b> is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning events and contact with higher voltage lines, and also for voltage stabilizion. In the past, water supply pipes were used as grounding electrodes, but due to {{the increased use of}} plastic pipes, which are poor conductors, the use of an actual grounding electrode is required. This type of ground applies to radio antennas and to lightning protection systems.|$|E
2500|$|A {{third term}} of The Global Village that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. The tetrad is {{something}} like threads in a complexly interwoven flowing superspace, a four-fold pattern of transformation. [...] "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." [...] Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and <b>ground</b> (<b>Earth)</b> simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.|$|E

Sometimes an additional wire is present in each cable to carry an unswitched neutral or hot wire which passes through the switch mounting box, but is not normally connected to the switch. If the switch has a pilot light or a receptacle, additional hot or neutral connections to the device may be required. <b>Grounding</b> (<b>earthing)</b> wires are not counted.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{assembled}} PCBs are static sensitive, {{and therefore}} {{must be placed}} in antistatic bags during transport.

Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive. Traces have become so fine that it's quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as MCMs and microwave PCBs.|$|R
