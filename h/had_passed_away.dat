5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>away</b> shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the battle}} is not {{generally}} considered the greatest achievement of the Canadian Corps in strategic importance or results obtained, {{it was the first}} instance in which all four Canadian divisions, made up of troops drawn {{from all parts of the}} country, fought as a cohesive formation. The image of national unity and achievement is what, according to one of many recent patriotic narratives, initially gave the battle importance for Canada. According to Pierce, [...] "The historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation." [...] The idea that Canada's national identity and nationhood were born out of {{the battle is}} an opinion that in the late twentieth century became widely held in military and general histories of Canada. According to McKay and Swift, the theory that Vimy Ridge is a source of Canada's rise as a nation is highly contested and developed in the latter part of the twentieth century after most of those who experienced the Great War <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

On the completion of his studies he was offered a position of religious leadership in his hometown, but declined.

2500|$|Following {{a lawsuit}} over {{the closure of}} the {{facility}} by former residents and the Legal Aid Society, on June 2, 2003 under the administration of Michael Bloomberg, the HHC agreed to pay $5 million out of court, with $18,000 going to each patient or their estate if they <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>away.</b> In addition, the city must give notice in the future if it intends to transfer 100 or more nursing home patients.

In 2006, the HHC considered plans to turn over facility to the city, and develop luxury homes on the site. These plans were opposed by local residents and politicians. Alternate plans from the community called for a veteran's rehabilitation center, or a children's hospital. Local politician Lew Simon, in opposition to the city plans, stated it would take [...] "seven years" [...] to rezone the land for other purposes. None of these plans came to fruition.

2500|$|The passage {{continues}} with a famous account of an interruption: [...] "At this {{moment he was}} unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purpose of the vision, yet, {{with the exception of}} some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>away</b> like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter!" [...] The actual person from Porlock mentioned could be many people, including Wordsworth, Joseph Cottle, John Thelwall, Coleridge's wife, or merely a literary device. As a symbol within the preface, the person represents the obligations of the real world crashing down upon the creative world or other factors that kept Coleridge from finishing his poetry. The claim to produce poetry after dreaming of it became popular after [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] was published. The person from Porlock later became a word to describe interrupted genius, and the literary critic Walter Jackson Bate recounted that while John Livingston Lowes taught the poem, he told his students [...] "If there is any man in the history of literature who should be hanged, drawn, and quartered, it is the man on business from Porlock." [...] The literary critic D. F. Rauber claimed that the man was [...] "necessary to create the illusion of the cut short rather than the stopped". This would have allowed Coleridge to purposely write the poem as a fragment.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 July 2017, Haye {{confirmed}} {{that had begun}} strengthening his ankle and he would slowly start training for his next fight which would likely take place in December 2017. On 24 July, negotiations had began for a rematch between Haye and Tony Bellew (28-2-1, 19 KOs) {{to take place in}} December 2017, although they were far from an agreement. Bellew made Haye of his preferred purse, which would reportedly make the rematch worth around £20 million. On 3 August, Hearn stated a rematch between Bellew and Haye was 'virtually dead', due to both fighters believing they are the A-side and have the right to demand ring walks, poster, changing rooms and split of purse. On 6 September, Hearn stated a deal could be made within seven days. According to Bellew's trainer, David Coldwell, both Haye and Bellew had held positive talks and looking more likely to agree to a fight, as long they stay on the same page and agree to the same terms. On 19 September, Haye agreed all the terms and tweeted Bellew to sign the contract. He said, [...] "It's taken months of negotiating but teams have finally agreed all terms for Haye-Bellew 2. Will Bellew put pen to paper?" [...] The fight was reported to take place on Sunday 17 December 2017. Promoter Eddie Hearn stated the fight was not a done deal, but he had hoped to confirm the fight within a week. Bellew replied the following day, tweeting, [...] "I OBLIGE YOU @mrdavidhaye , happy? Now leave me alone with my family please. I'll see you soon enough!" [...] The fight was officially confirmed on 29 September for the fight to take place at the O2 Arena in London.

2500|$|Hughes {{had made}} {{numerous}} business partnerships through industrialist and producer, David Charnay. Their friendship and many partnerships began with The Conqueror film, which was first {{released to the}} public in 1956. The film caused many controversies due to the film's radioactive location in St. George, Utah that eventually led to Hughes buying up nearly every copy of the film he could, only to watch the film at home repeatedly for many nights in a row. Charnay later bought the Four Star film and television production company that produced The Conqueror. Hughes and Charnay’s most published dealings were with a contested AirWest LBO. Charnay led the LBO buyout group that involved Howard Hughes and their partners acquiring Air West. Hughes, Charnay, as well as three others were indicted. The complexity of this LBO was the first of its kind. The indictment, made by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton, accused the group of conspiring to drive down the stock price of Air West in order to pressure company directors to sell to Hughes. The charges were dismissed after a judge had determined that the indictment had failed to allege an illegal action on the part of Hughes, Charnay, and all the other accused in the indictment. Thompson, the federal judge that made the decision to dismiss the charges called the indictment one of the worst claims that he had ever seen. The charges were filed again, a second time, by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton's assistant, Dean Vernon. The Federal Judge ruled on November 13, 1974 and elaborated to say that the case suggested a [...] "reprehensible misuse of the power of great wealth" [...] and in his judicial opinion, [...] "no crime had been committed." [...] The aftermath of the Air West deal was later settled with the SEC by paying former stockholders for alleged losses from the sale of their investment in Air West stock. As noted above, Air West was subsequently renamed Hughes Airwest. During a long pause between the years of the dismissed charges against Hughes, Charnay, and their partners, Howard Hughes had mysteriously passed away mid-flight while on the way to Houston from Acapulco. No further attempts were made to file any indictments after Hughes <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
