Palin responded, [...] "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't {{have a problem with}} that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a <b>fair</b> <b>question</b> to be looking at. Palin answered, [...] "I think it's a <b>fair</b> <b>question,</b> just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game. The McCain–Palin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 3, 2009, {{interview}} with Rusty Humphries, Palin {{was asked about}} President Barack Obama's birth certificate.

I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, [...] "I think it's a <b>fair</b> <b>question,</b> just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game." [...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done.

[...] On 29 March 2015, Hopkins was reported to the police by Labour MP Simon Danczuk for possible race hate crimes.

60|$|It is a <b>fair</b> <b>question</b> for the moralist, {{whether it}} is right and proper wholly to ignore one's {{personal}} claims to justice.

2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen {{increased}} scrutiny of justices accepting expensive gifts and travel. All {{of the members}} of the Roberts Court have accepted travel or gifts. In 2012, Justice Sonia Sotomayor received $1.9 million in advances from her publisher Knopf Doubleday. Justice Scalia and others took dozens of expensive trips to exotic locations paid for by private donors. Private events sponsored by partisan groups that are attended by both the justices and those who have an interest in their decisions have raised concerns about access and inappropriate communications. Stephen Spaulding, the legal director at Common Cause, said: [...] "There are <b>fair</b> <b>questions</b> raised by some of these trips about their commitment to being impartial." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (<b>FAIR)</b> <b>questioned</b> whether, in {{the event}} a {{television}} station openly supported and collaborated with coup leaders, the station in question would {{not be subject to}} even more serious consequences in the United States or any other Western nation. Others also criticised the motives and presentation of the conflict offered by the mass corporate media, pointing to the alleged predominance of private corporate media in Venezuela, which according to Dan Jakopovich is often critical of Chavez and others on the left-wing. As well, several British politicians and journalists supported Chávez's decision to not renew RCTV's broadcasting license, due to their belief that the station had [...] "used its access to the public airwaves to repeatedly call for the overthrow of the democratically elected government of President Hugo Chávez." ...|$|R

"I should warn you, sir," [...] {{the young}} man threw off, [...] "how little we {{consider}} that--in Buckingham Crescent certainly--a <b>fair</b> <b>question.</b> It isn't playing the game--it's hitting below the belt.

6000|$|... "Quite a <b>fair</b> <b>question.</b> My answer is, of course: 'All three'; but {{the point}} is rather: Does one wish to make even an attempt to define God to oneself? Frankly, I don't!

These are <b>fair</b> <b>questions.</b> The volume of cataract surgery already has increased dramatically around the world over the past 20 years. It increased approximately fourfold in just 10 years in both the United States and Sweden through the 1980 s; and increased threefold in the United Kingdom over this time.

I gather that these expeditions are generally rough on cattle. Then we lost our way, and, provisions growing scanty, divided the party, three returning and three holding on, Geoffrey and I, unfortunately, among the latter. We got lost worse than ever on the return journey, and were steering south, we hoped, at the last gasp, so to speak, when we found you.

We've never been here before; but that's a matter of little moment, for it's not the first time I've been on what may be called a discovery-trading expedition. We are somewhat entangled, however, just now, among these wild passes, and, if you can guide us out of our difficulties to the east side of the mountains, I'll thank you heartily and pay you well.

6000|$|It is {{very easy}} to {{demonstrate}} that there are more men than there is work for men to do. For instance, what would happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps should become suddenly inspired with an overmastering desire for work? It is a <b>fair</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "Go to work" [...] is preached to the tramp every day of his life. The judge on the bench, the pedestrian in the street, the housewife at the kitchen door, all unite in advising him to go to work. So what would happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps acted upon this advice and strenuously and indomitably sought work? Why, {{by the end of the}} week one hundred thousand workers, their places taken by the tramps, would receive their time and be [...] "hitting the road" [...] for a job.|$|E
