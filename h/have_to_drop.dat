25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin {{was brought in to}} bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder {{what would have happened if}} Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E
500|$|Patton's {{offensive}} {{came to a}} halt on August 31, 1944, as the Third Army ran out of fuel {{near the}} Moselle River, just outside Metz. Patton expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support successful advances, but Eisenhower favored a [...] "broad front" [...] approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> off flank protection, and would quickly lose its punch. Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, Eisenhower gave Montgomery and his Twenty First Army Group a higher priority for supplies for Operation Market Garden. Combined with other demands on the limited resource pool, this resulted in the Third Army exhausting its fuel supplies. Patton believed his forces were close enough to the Siegfried Line that he remarked to Bradley that with 400,000gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany within two days. In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army was defeated by the U.S. 4th Armored Division at the Battle of Arracourt. Despite the victory, the Third Army stayed in place as a result of Eisenhower's order. The German commanders believed this was because their counterattack had been successful.|$|E
500|$|In France, the {{severity}} of the sentences led to a campaign by the French Communist Party and to various demonstrations by Vietnamese expatriates. At the time, more than 1,500 Vietnamese students were resident in France, particularly in Paris. In May, more than 1,000 demonstrated outside Élysée Palace against the French reaction to Yen Bay. The police arrested 47 and eventually deported 17 back to Vietnam, where most of them engaged in communist anti-colonial activities. Due to the high number of death sentences handed down, the Minister of Colonies intervened with Governor-General Pasquier, so that no execution could be performed unless the case had been reviewed by a pardoning commission. The presidential pardon reduced the quantity of death penalties pronounced at Yen Bay from 39 to 13. Pardon was refused only to those who had killed a French officer, warrant officer, or a native soldier. The civilians benefited proportionately more from this intervention, as the enlisted soldiers had been responsible for most of the killings at Yen Bay. Among the 13 who were guillotined on June 17, 1930 were the top VNQDĐ leaders, Hoc and Chinh. The condemned men cried [...] "Viet Nam!" [...] as they were to be executed. Hoc made a last plea to the French {{in the form of a}} letter. In it, he claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with the authorities, but that French intransigence had forced him to revolt. He contended that if France wanted to stay in Indochina, then it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> policies that he termed as brutal, and become more amiable towards Vietnamese people. He called for the introduction of universal education, training in commerce and industry and an end to the corruption of the French-installed mandarins. The magazine Phu Nu Tan Van (Women’s News) disseminated pictures of the condemned VNQDĐ members in one of their issues, raising the stature of the revolutionaries in death.|$|E

2500|$|Asked at {{his first}} {{appearance}} as chancellor at the Treasury Select Committee whether he agreed with his predecessor's view on the depth and duration of the recession and not wishing to contradict Major, Lamont replied that [...] "there are reasons why one could believe {{that it will be}} relatively short-lived and relatively shallow." [...] In October 1991, based on CBI and Institute of Directors business surveys, said [...] "what we are seeing is the return of that vital ingredient – confidence. The Green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again." [...] Early in 1992 one of the Sunday newspapers ran a [...] "Green Shoots Index" [...] of signs of recovery, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> it when few such signs could be found. However, Gavyn Davies, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a newspaper article at the time of Lamont's removal from the Treasury that the [...] "Green shoots" [...] speech {{had turned out to be}} [...] "remarkably prescient. From that moment onwards, output stopped declining, and within a few months, it started to rise. [...] Estimates of Gross Domestic Product show the trough of the recession occurring in the fourth quarter of 1991, with sustained growth resuming in the third quarter of 1992, when GDP grew 0.4% compared to the second quarter.|$|E
2500|$|An {{air raid}} offense (predominantly passing-oriented with quarterback in shotgun {{formation}} usually with four wide receivers) coordinated by Leach, Washington State was projected {{to have one}} of its biggest advantages in the passing game, where junior quarterback Connor Halliday recorded 4187 passing yards, which was fourth in the country, on 656 passing attempts, which led the country by more than 50, for 28 touchdowns and 21 interceptions, the latter of which was most in the country. He spread the ball around to many different receivers; eight different receivers had more than 30 catches. The Cougars' leading receiver was sophomore Gabe Marks, who caught 69 passes for 770 yards and 6 touchdowns. Fellow sophomore Dom Williams caught 39 passes for 644 yards and a team-leading 7 touchdowns, [...] senior Vince Mayle caught 40 passes for 501 yards and 6 touchdowns, and freshman River Cracaft, an honorable mention all-conference honoree, caught 37 passes for 489 yards and 2 touchdowns. There were no tight ends on the roster. Washington State's offensive line was expected to be able to protect Halliday relatively easily, as Colorado State would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> a significant portion of its defense in to coverage, thus limiting its ability to blitz. Senior center Elliot Bosch, who was an honorable mention all-conference performer, anchored the offensive line, and was supported by fellow former walk-ons Gunnar Eklund, a sophomore left tackle, and Joe Dahl, a sophomore left guard. Leach commented on the group of walk-ons, specifically Bosch, noting, [...] "He’s developed his skills, worked really hard in the weight room and has been a big cornerstone for us. We wouldn’t be in a bowl game without him." [...] The Cougars' measly rushing attack, which averaged only 58.7 yards per game (123 out of 123 in the FBS), included junior Marcus Mason and sophomore Teondray Caldwell. Senior Andrew Furney, an honorable mention all-conference performer, handled the kicking duties, and made 15 of his 19 field goal tries with a long of 52 yards and 43 of his 44 extra point tries.|$|E
