5|$|Richard Bonnie, a {{professor}} of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state {{as one of the most}} substantial lessons from the period.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central {{administration}} arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat in a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity about the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proper Dutch consular service {{to promote the}} Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced {{the idea that the}} consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national flag.|$|E
5|$|Saint Catherine's Monastery still {{maintains}} the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves. However, recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 {{and signed by}} Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, indicate that the manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to {{the legality of the}} gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s learning orientation in developing alliance relationships. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on research conducted on organizations involved in alliances as well as practical evidence. Findings – The paper finds that alliance managers need to focus on developing learning capabilities within their organizations to achieve superior alliance performance. Practical implications – The paper has practical implications for managers involved in alliances as it shows the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organization focusing on learning. With the relatively small number of alliance relationships that succeed, it is important that managers harness their organization 2 ̆ 7 s learning potential in the context <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance.

5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
