40|$|Interest has {{surrounded}} {{the use of}} adsorbent hollow fibres (HF) {{as an alternative to}} existing adsorption technology, such as packed beds, because of their comparatively low pressure drop and efficient sorption cycles. The aim of this research was to improve the understanding of the transport phenomena within adsorbent HF, in order to optimise their design for VOC abatement based on breakthrough performance. Computational models of HF’s with circular, trilobal and clover shaped bores were developed, with a single and multichannel design based on a circular bore and n-butane was used as the model VOC. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were applied to resolve the conservation equations involving continuity, momentum and species transport. Convective and diffusive transport were assumed within the fibre bore whereas in the porous media transfer occurred by diffusion and adsorption, modelled using the Langmuir isotherm. The dimensions of HF’s and operating conditions were obtained from experimental work in our group. The pressure drop in the HF’s were found to be significantly lower than in packed bed. In terms of breakthrough and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times,</b> the order of performance is smaller multichannel fibres > circular > clover > trilobal. Parametric studies showed that the most significant impact on breakthrough and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times</b> results from varying the effective diffusivity of gas in the porous media, the Reynolds number in the bore and the Langmuir constant.

40|$|Previous works {{concerning}} active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability (e. g., Blandford & McKee 1982) {{have assumed}} that the emission characteristics of illuminated clouds are purely {{a function of the}} instant continuum flux to which they are exposed. This paper shows that this assumption is not necessarily justified and that the history of exposure accounting for "local delays" due to finite cloud <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times</b> can also be relevant. For this reason, a new formalism is developed in this paper for computing the observational properties of models which have local delays. The nature of the nonlinear behavior that results is calculated for some very simple nonlinear cloud line emission models. It is found that the mean response time {{is a function of the}} recent average value of the continuum. Linear models fit to these nonlinear systems respond too slowly when there are low-energy (and generally rapid) changes in the continuum, yet respond too rapidly when there are high-energy (and generally slow) changes in the continuum. As with systems without local delays, the expression for the time-dependent line flux contains an integration over history of the "spatial" response function, which has structure at lags of the light travel times of the emission region. However, the kernel of this integral itself is a function of additional integrations over individual "cloud" response functions which have structure at lags of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times</b> of the cloud properties relevant to line emission. If instantaneous or linear response is incorrectly assumed, local delays and nonlinear response can make a system appear larger than it actually is. These effects are similar to those that beaming can cause. Local delays can also be a source of asymmetry about the peak of the cross-correlation function.

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] microextraction (SPME) is a well-known sampling and sample preparation technique used {{for a wide variety}} of analytical applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction, a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming experiments in the laboratory. In this study, a mechanistic mathematical model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model was validated with previously reported experimental data from three different sources. Several key factors that affect the extraction kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times</b> in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the variation of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>times</b> are discussed, with the assumption that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a large number of experiments in the laboratory.
