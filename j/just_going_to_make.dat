500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

Dermot chaffed all and sundry; Viola bustled about; Harold sat on the dresser, with his blue eyes gleaming in the firelight with silent amusement and perfect satisfaction, the cat sitting on his shoulder; and nurse, who was firmly persuaded that he had rescued her dear Master Dermot from the fangs of the lion, was delighted to do her best for his entertainment. Viola insisted on displaying all the curiosities--the puzzle-cup {{that could not be}} used, the horrid frog that sprang to your lips in the tankard, the rolling-pin covered with sentimental poetry, and her extraordinary French pictures on the walls. Dermot kept us full of merriment, and we laughed on till the sound of the dressing-bell sent us racing up to the castle in joyous guilt. That kettledrum at the lodge is one of the brightest spots in my memory.|$|E

5000|$|My first {{instinct}} was, {{there are such}} iconic images in the Wizard of Oz movie, {{it would be wrong}} for us to re-create the Yellow Brick Road or the Emerald City in a different way. We had to go 180 degrees in the other direction. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> our own Oz. Sam Raimi on recreating the Land of Oz under legalities. The film was technically a prequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, The Wizard of Oz, but it was not allowed to be considered as such. The filmmakers had to toe a fine line between calling the film to mind but not infringing upon it. To that end, they had a copyright expert on set to ensure no infringement occurred. The production team worked under the constraint of abiding by the stipulations set forth by Warner Bros., the legal owner of the rights to iconic elements of the 1939 film (via its Turner Entertainment subsidiary which purchased the MGM film library in 1986), including the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland. Therefore, Disney was unable to use them nor any character likenesses from that particular film. This extended to the green of the Wicked Witch's skin, for which Disney used what its legal department considered a sufficiently different shade dubbed [...] "Theostein" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "Theodora" [...] and [...] "Frankenstein"). Additionally, the studio could not use the signature chin mole of Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West, nor could they employ the yellow brick road's swirl design for Munchkinland. The expert also ensured that the Emerald City was not too close in appearance to the Emerald City in the 1939 film.|$|R

[...] Also in the interview, Minaj hinted at a special guest joining her on tour by saying, [...] "I can’t wait for them to find out who I’m going on tour with.

5000|$|In January 2014, whilst touring {{in support}} of Frightened Rabbit's fourth studio album, Pedestrian Verse (2013), vocalist and guitarist Scott Hutchison {{expressed}} his desire to record solo material without the band, stating: [...] "The process has to be different, otherwise I’m <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a Frightened Rabbit-sounding record, which I really don’t want to do." [...] The idea for a solo album stemmed from Frightened Rabbit's label, Atlantic Records: [...] "It was actually {{the idea of the}} label to make it rather than me. I {{thought we were going to}} get off tour and go straight back into writing another album, and the guy at the label knew things weren't really quite right. He basically was like, 'We'll pay for this record. Go away, make a record and indulge yourself.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, [...] "London Bridge" [...] {{received}} extremely polarized {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stone called the song a [...] "total ripoff of Hollaback Girl", Gwen Stefani's number one single of 2005. A reviewer of About.com described the song as being [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] "slathered in puerile sexual raunch". Steve Yates of The Observer describes the song as being [...] "much in the M.I.A. vein". Amy Phillips of Pitchforkmedia noted {{how much the}} song and Lil Mama's Lip Gloss resembled M.I.A.'s songs such as her 2003 single [...] "Galang", serving {{as a reminder of}} how much the mainstream pop, dance, and rap musical landscape had shifted since M.I.A. [...] "first appeared in 2004". M.I.A. later asked Interscope boss Jimmy Iovine after hearing the track [...] "If I don't sell records and make money for you you're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them with her anyway", however Iovine notes that the song is yet another example of how M.I.A. was [...] "an artist who inspires other artists." ...|$|E
5000|$|Townsend {{recalls that}} after Alien, {{he already knew}} that he wouldn't want to {{continue}} SYL as a project, and that he already wished to abandon SYL {{after the release of}} City already, considering the project's purpose fulfilled. In an interview conducted by Terrorizer in August 2006, Townsend explained why he decided to put the band on hold:At the end of the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored.

Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.Although Hoglan initially denied the definitive break-up of the band, saying they would go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on [...] "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, as well as other people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 Metal Hammer interview, where he stated [...] "there may be some stuff I do in the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be Strapping".|$|R

5000|$|The Ombudsman for the City of Toronto, Fiona Crean, {{published}} {{a report in}} September 2012 suggesting that Mayor Ford's office had [...] "compromised" [...] the civic appointments process for city boards and agencies.

[...] The Ombudsman and the existence of the position itself were later criticized by Ford and became the subject of further debate. In October, Mayor Ford said he wanted to eliminate three watchdog positions: that of the Ombudsman, the Integrity Commissioner and the lobbyist registrar. [...] "You don't need a lobbyist registry, an ombudsman and an integrity commissioner. They have 20 people; they're tripping over themselves. They're trying to make themselves look busy." [...] All three positions are required under Ontario law and were established after the MFP computer leasing scandal inquiry.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Elle, Caillat confessed that {{the idea for the}} song came after going into the recording studio with [...] "Babyface", explaining that she told him that she was getting {{a lot of pressure to}} be someone she was not, both musically and image-wise. She claimed, [...] "Although I don’t want to do it, I’m <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these people happy. He started laughing, and said, we’re not going to do that. That’s not you, and that’s ridiculous of them to ask. That right there gave me the creative freedom." [...] He said, [...] "Let’s write about exactly what they’re asking you to do — to change yourself." [...] We started checking off all these things that all of us girls do everyday to get ready to go out. ... So Babyface inspired me to write this and it's all from a personal experience." [...] Caillat explained that, [...] "This song is not to say that we should never wear makeup, but to say that, sometimes, it's okay not to." [...] She further told People that, [...] "and songwriters told me you don't have to try to be someone else, because people like who you are." ...|$|E

On 6 January 2017, when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Sheeran revealed that [...] "Shape of You" [...] had originally been written with Rihanna in mind. To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public. He said: [...] "of You' is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and we were writing this song and I was like 'this would really work for Rihanna,'" [...] he explained. [...] "And then I started singing lyrics like 'putting Van The Man on the jukebox' and I was like 'well she's not really going to sing that, is she?' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rick {{approaches}} Jimmy, backpack {{back in his}} arms. He is {{unaware that}} Jimmy intends to find whoever did that {{and bring them to}} the Principal. Jimmy asks Rick how he's holding up and says he has Rick's back if anyone bothers him again. Rick replies, [...] "You stabbed me in the back." [...] Jimmy is confused, especially as Rick pulls the gun out of his bag. With the gun pointed at him, Jimmy freezes for a second, and backs away slowly. Jimmy turns to run away when Rick turned his head before firing. The bullet hits Jimmy in the back, knocking him to the ground. As other students are running away, Craig walks down the hall to see Jimmy lying on the floor. Rick finds Emma with Toby and Sean, and says that he is sorry he kissed Emma, the gun in his hand at his side. They turn to run away but Rick demands that they don't turn away from him. Rick starts saying how Emma flirted with him and made him think she care when really it was a lie. Sean calmly tries to reason with Rick, and tells Rick that it's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his life worse, but Rick replies that it is too late because he already shot somebody. He lifts the gun, pointing it straight at Emma, but Sean gets {{in front of her and}} grabs the gun. While Rick and Sean wrestle with it, the gun goes off.

5000|$|The band began {{formally}} {{recording the}} album in February 2012. The album was self-produced, and recorded in Connolly's private recording home-based studio. Connolly stated this approach came with both its benefits and its difficulties: ...being a singer recording {{in your own}} house in a neighborhood, which is very interesting. It {{was probably the most}} bizarre recording schedule I’ve ever been on. Actually tracked the vocals from about 8:30 in the morning till about 11:00/11:30/noon, somewhere around there, {{because it was the only}} time of the day where I could get complete quiet in the neighborhood. It’s either that or UPS trucks or here comes the landscapers down the street...It’s a great concept to go, “Yeah, yeah, we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a record in the house,” then all of a sudden you start doing it and, wait a minute, turn the Wii off, I can hear Just Dance coming through. And the landscapers are definitely in a couple of songs for sure. I heard it and we buried it enough..But just coming to terms with the sound of your voice and doing it here at home, kind of where I can do it by myself and critique the shit out of it, it’s tough when you step out for the first time and you go, I need to become a lead singer. How do you do that? So I had to really kind of sit down and do a little bit of homework and figure out what my strengths were, things I did better than others, what you want to do but don’t want to [...]|$|E

The problem is, to keep things from boiling just yet, we need to keep following various subplots that aren’t anywhere near as interesting as the main question of just what the hell Rick is planning on doing." [...] He then commented positively on Rick's scenes, saying [...] "Rick’s scenes packed a wallop this week, building to an ending that I didn’t expect." [...] He then said Rick has been on the edge for a while now, but it’s fascinating here to watch him rant at the townsfolk, because part of what he’s saying (like the fact that these people are absolute shit at going on runs outside the fence, unless it’s Aaron on a recruiting trip) is legitimately true. That doesn’t make him sound reasonable or even sane, but it also makes him impossible to dismiss. The show has tried to do ambiguous conflicts before, and fumbled them because it’s hard to work up a lot of tension when the “bad” guys are too indistinct to be a clear threat. But there’s tension right now because the Alexandrians’ apparent decency works in perfect contrast with our heroes’ rugged desperation. It’s still entirely possible that all of this will collapse next week, but for once, there’s a fight going on with a risk that feels more pressing than the loss of a location or the sacrifice of a couple of cast members.
