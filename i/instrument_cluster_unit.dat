40|$|<b>Instrument</b> <b>Clusters</b> {{have grown}} {{increasingly}} {{complex in the}} last decade to include multi-character displays as standard features. Automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) all too often leave the types of messages displayed in their <b>Instrument</b> <b>Cluster’s</b> up to the component suppliers, this accounts for huge overhead costs in software design, text string translations, validation, and maintenance. This paper presents a design of a database for an Automotive OEM’s <b>Instrument</b> <b>Cluster</b> Driver Information Display as well as a tool for viewing the database and validation. This paper focuses on allowing an OEM to design its own database in house using inexpensive tooling to avoid the costly overhead of having a component supplier design the database in addition to designing the software to run the <b>Instrument</b> <b>Cluster...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that elderly drivers, those aged 65 years and older, find current in-vehicle technology, specifically <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> panel difficult to use. Existing {{research has}} determined the source of this discomfort stems from a misalignment between contemporary designs and the designs most usable for elderly drivers. Researchers believe that cognitive ability, which is negatively correlated with age, reduces the driver’s ability to retrieve information from complex <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> designs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate how young (20 to 30 years old) and elderly drivers (65 years old and above) interacted with novel <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> designs, based on how the designs facilitated information retrieval during driving. 50 participants (gender balanced) completed a series of simulated driving tasks to retrieve information from the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> while driving on two road conditions (city and highway) during a simulated driving. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether designed <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> panels facilitated reading performance, which was measured in the amount of seconds it took participants to retrieve information from the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster.</b> Additionally, analysis of variance was used to evaluate whether age significantly affected user satisfaction. Our results indicated that designed <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> did not facilitate meter reading for elderly drivers, nor did they elicit higher user satisfaction scores. Age significantly impacted response time. Further analysis also revealed that response time improved in later stages of the experiment, possibly related to the participant learning how to use the driving simulator over the course of the experiment. Future studies could use a longitudinal experiment to minimize the potential learning effect found in this experiment. This study indicated that there should not be novel <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> designs for elderly drivers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to design and develop a GUI (graphical user interface) based Driver {{information}} system. <b>Instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> are the traditional readout meters available in the dashboard of cars and motorbikes. In regard of the conventional meters that are in existence, the analog meters have disadvantages in lack of storage capability and accuracy whereas digital meters have display problems in dim light areas. In order to overcome these disadvantages the <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> can be controlled and made user friendly {{with the help of}} GUI. Graphical User Interface allows the drivers to interact with <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> using images rather than text commands and command line arguments. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design. These actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. This can be implemented in <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> with the help of. NET software along with the assistance of MS access as back end tool...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} proposes {{an assessment}} model for quantifying the perceived visual complexity (PVC) of an in-vehicle <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster.</b> An initial {{study was conducted}} to investigate the possibility of evaluating the PVC of an in-vehicle <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> by estimating and analyzing the complexity of its individual components. However, this approach was only partially successful, because it did {{not take into account the}} combination of the different components with random levels of complexity to form one visual display. Therefore, a second study was conducted focusing on the effect of combining the different components. The results from the overall research enabled us to suggest a basis for quantifying the PVC of an in-vehicle <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> based both on the PVCs of its components and on the integration effect. close 0...|$|R
50|$|Electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are being}} {{increasingly}} common features on railway vehicles, in which individual instruments {{are replaced by}} various forms of digital readouts. Early uses of <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> often employed LEDs to display analog-type or numeric readings for pressure gauges, electrical gauges, and other displays. They have been increasingly integrated with various cab signalling systems and together with the installation of multi-function displays, have simplified the cab layout and improved user interaction with the engineer.|$|R
