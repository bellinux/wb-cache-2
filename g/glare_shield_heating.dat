40|$|Abstract. A <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} on the cement crash barrier to block strong light from the vehicles in contrary direction. It is useful to prevent car accidents and increase the safety of driving. This study uses the contradiction matrix in the TRIZ method, 39 engineering parameters, and 40 inventive and innovative principles to identify the areas of improvement to address the above problems. There are two features of our study. (1) We install a spring structure {{for the sake of}} reducing the damage rate of <b>glare</b> <b>shields.</b> When <b>glare</b> <b>shields</b> suffer from strong wind, a flexible structure located at base can let <b>glare</b> <b>shields</b> curve and spring back to original position, and therefore endures more powerful wind hit. In addition, the spring back function lets the guide post automatically return to original position to block strong light and protect drivers. This structure will have more durable service life, so, {{it can be used to}} reduce the maintenance times, and cost for the users. (2) We add solar LED light on the body of a <b>glare</b> <b>shield,</b> that can enhance the alert function when attacked by strong wind on the night time or insufficient light and then reduce the accident rate...|$|R

40|$|For {{roadside}} work-zones {{in areas}} that have opposing traffic flow, safety is enhanced if the temporary barriers incorporate a “glare-shield ” that blocks headlight glare from opposing traffic. Currently-available 32 -inch portable concrete barriers {{require the use of}} an add-on <b>glare</b> <b>shield</b> attached {{to the top of the}} barrier. The addon <b>glare</b> <b>shields</b> are an extra expense and complicate barrier set-up and handling. An alternative solution was to develop a 50 -inch high portable concrete barrier which is tall enough to serve as its own glare-shield. Finite element analysis was used to investigate various barrier shapes and connection schemes to identify a successful crashworthy design that would meet requirments of NCHRP Report 350 Test level 3. A 50 -inch portable concrete barrier design was developed based on the results of the finite element analyses and was crash tested at the Transportation Research Center in East Liberty, Ohio. The system successfully met all safety criteria of NCHRP Report 350 and has been approved by the Federal Highway Administration for use on the National Highway System as a test level 3 device...|$|R

40|$|Exploratory {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with several conceptual radiative <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> of composite construction. Measured transient temperature distributions were obtained for a graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation and with three types of insulating materials, and for a metal multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> at surface temperatures of approximately 2, 000 F and 1, 450 F, respectively, by use of a radiant-heat facility. The graphite configurations suffered loss of surface material under repeated irradiation. Temperature distribution calculated for the metal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> by a numerical procedure was in good agreement with measured data. Environmental survival tests of the graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation, an insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> and a stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were made at temperatures of 2, 000 F and dynamic pressures of approximately 6, 000 lb/sq ft, provided by an ethylene-heated jet operating at a Mach number of 2. 0 and sea-level conditions. The graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> survived the simulated aerodynamic heating and pressure loading. A problem area exists {{in the design and}} materials for heat-resistant fasteners between the graphite shield and the base structure. The insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> was found to be superior to the stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> in retarding <b>heat</b> flow. Over-lapped face-plate joints and surface smoothness of the insulated multi- post <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were not adversely affected by the test environment.

To protect the probe structure and the scientific instruments, a carbon phenolic <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> was placed on the front of the probes. Because the design of <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> for planetary entry is a developing technology, thermocouples were placed in the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> so that actual and predicted <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> performance could be compared. The function of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> is discussed, the probe environments during entry into the Venusian atmosphere are described, and some results from the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> experiment are presented.

40|$|The {{parameters}} of the efflux from a helium dewar in space were numerically calculated. The flow was modeled as a one dimensional compressible ideal gas with variable properties. The primary boundary conditions are flow with friction and flow with heat transfer and friction. Two PASCAL programs were developed to calculate the efflux parameters: EFFLUZD and EFFLUXM. EFFLUXD calculates the minimum mass flow for the given shield temperatures and <b>shield</b> <b>heat</b> inputs. It then calculates the pipe lengths, diameter, and fluid parameters which satisfy all boundary conditions. Since the diameter returned by EFFLUXD is only rarely of nominal size, EFFLUXM calculates the mass flow and <b>shield</b> <b>heat</b> exchange for given pipe lengths, diameter, and shield temperatures...|$|R

Cost and reusability evaluations of TD Ni- 20 Cr <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> systems are presented, and weight estimates of a TD Ni- 20 Cr <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> system for use on a shuttle orbiter vehicle are made. Safe-line expectancy of a TD Ni- 20 Cr <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> system is assessed. Non-destructive test techniques are evaluated to determine their effectiveness in quality assurance checks of TD Ni- 20 Cr components such as <b>heat</b> <b>shields,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> supports, close-out panels, formed cover strips, and edge seals.

50|$|Snow Tracs in {{use today}} are often {{modified}} and {{it is common to}} find overheating problems plague these machines because <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> have been removed {{to make it easier to}} work on engines.

In either case the function was ultimately the same, to keep the exhaust and muffler heat away from the engine. The vertical <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> seems to have been commonly utilized on the Royal Marines and N.A.T.O. versions of the Snow Trac, it may have also been used on civilian versions. The horizontal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> is the most commonly found on Snow Tracs.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests of}} a 3 % scale {{model of the}} aft portion of the SRB {{equipped}} with partially scaled <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> were conducted {{for the purpose of}} measuring fluctuating pressure levels in the aft skirt region. During these tests, the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> were observed to oscillate violently, the oscillations in some instances causing the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> to fail. High speed films taken during the tests reveal a regular pattern of waves in the fabric starting near the flow stagnation point and progressing around both sides of the annulus. The amplitude of the waves was too great, and their pattern too regular, for them to be attributed to the fluctuating pressure levels measured during the tests. The cause of the oscillations observed in the model <b>heat</b> <b>shields,</b> and whether or not similar oscillations will occur in the full scale SRB <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> during reentry were investigated. Suggestions for modifying the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> so as to avoid the oscillations are provided, and recommendations are made for a program of vibration and wind tunnel tests of reduced-scale aeroelastic models of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield...</b>|$|R

50|$|Thermal soak {{is a part}} {{of almost}} all TPS schemes.
