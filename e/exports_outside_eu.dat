40|$|This paper explores how {{different}} public administrations (regional, national, European and Framework Program) allocate public resources to promote innovation among innovative {{companies in the}} Spanish manufacturing industry. We incorporate variables {{that have never been}} treated in this line of research before, such as exportoriented and Pavitt’s taxonomy among others. In order to know the preferences of each public program aimed at promoting innovation we use two econometric estimation techniques: first, a binary logistic regression and, second, another binary logistic regression corrected for selection bias derived from the lack of consideration of certain relevant characteristics of manufacturing firms that do not innovate. We check if the importance and statistical significance of certain explanatory variables depend on the estimation method used. We found that the four public administrations preferably assign public resources to Spanish companies that cooperate with other domestic companies. We also found that European programs (EU and Framework Program) show their allocation preferences towards innovative firms that <b>export</b> <b>outside</b> <b>EU.</b> The public aid from the Spanish central administration seeks to promote the creation of large ‘national champions’. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article quantifies for {{the first}} time not only the {{domestic}} employment effects of foreign EU exports but also the correct number of jobs generated through intra-European trade (Single Market) in the production of such exported commodities. The literature has neglected very often the latter effects mainly {{due to the lack of}} an appropriate methodology and database. The empirical evidence shows that the EU has really progressed during the period 2000 - 2007 towards a more vertically integrated economy, reducing the labour intensity of the goods and services <b>exported</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>EU,</b> trading most prominently within the EU Single Market and subsequently, generating an increasing number of jobs. Despite the reduction in the labour intensity of the European exports, the associated employment grew from 22 to 25 million jobs, out of which 9 million jobs were created due to spillover and feedback effects associated to the Single Market.

40|$|The Italian orange fruit <b>export</b> {{development}} <b>outside</b> <b>EU</b> {{countries has}} required commercial agreements regarding the restriction of parasites spread especially Mediterranean fruit fly. The correct use of cold treatment during the shipment {{is used to}} satisfy this requirement. This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head space was less than 0. 5 °C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off cycle of the automatic defrosting system. Though temperature probes placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0. 8 °C, near the cold air outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal resistance of fruit boxes, and so making fruits mostly affected by the cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet...|$|R
40|$|The W 2 Plastics project aims at a {{fundamental}} change of the present status of plastics recycling by creating a breakthrough technology for the recycling of polyolefins from complex wastes, i. e., wastes such as Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW), household waste and Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR). Polyolefin’s are a very important family of polymers, constituting 45 % of the total plastics consumption in Europe (EU) and complex wastes provide the vastest, presently unused potential resource of secondary polyolefin’s. In spite of that, only one million ton out of 14 million tons yearly sold in EU is being recycled into high-end applications. Nowadays, Polyolefin recyclers focus mainly on the relatively pure post-industrial or single-product wastes, since these wastes can be made into high-purity product materials by existing and cost-effective process technology. Post-industrial wastes are increasingly <b>exported</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>EU,</b> however, and so the Polyolefin recycling industry and their end-users are forced to look for alternative resources. The European FP 7 Project: W 2 Plastics is developing a number of novel concepts, in particular Magnetic Density Separation (MDS) and Ultrasound process and quality control by HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI), into a new technology to recover highpurity polyolefin’s from complex wastes at low cost. The unique promise of this new concept derives from its ability to accurately separate many different materials in a single process step, resulting in an environmentally friendly and cheap process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{efficient}} large-scale {{recycling of}} plastic waste is of increasing interest from an ecological and economic {{point of view}} but it represents a goal {{that has yet to}} be achieved by the recycling industry. The W 2 Plastics project aims at a fundamental change of the present status of plastics recycling by creating a breakthrough technology for the recycling of polyolefin’s from complex wastes, i. e., wastes such as Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW), household waste and Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR). Polyolefin’s are a very important family of polymers, constituting more than a third of the total plastics consumption in Europe (EU) and complex wastes provide the vastest, presently unused potential resource of secondary polyolefin’s. In spite of that, Polyolefin’s (PP, LDPE, HDPE) are the least recycled plastics materials. Only one million ton out of 14 million tons yearly sold in EU is being recycled. Nowadays, Polyolefin recyclers focus mainly on the relatively pure post-industrial or single-product wastes, since these wastes can be made into high-purity product materials by existing and cost-effective process technology. Post-industrial wastes are increasingly <b>exported</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>EU,</b> however, and so the Polyolefin recycling industry and their end-users are forced to look for alternative resources. In principle, post-consumer wastes, such as WEEE, CDW, household waste and ASR provide such a resource. They are a five to ten times larger reservoir of polyolefin’s than do post-industrial wastes, but these wastes are also much more complex mixtures of materials and hence much more difficult to recycle.
