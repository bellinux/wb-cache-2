2500|$|Polycarbonate is {{a durable}} material. [...] Although it has high impact-resistance, it has low scratch-resistance. Therefore, a <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> {{is applied to}} {{polycarbonate}} eyewear lenses and polycarbonate exterior automotive components. The characteristics of polycarbonate compare to those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, acrylic), but polycarbonate is stronger and will hold up longer to extreme temperature. Polycarbonate is highly transparent to visible light, with better light transmission than many kinds of glass.|$|E
2500|$|The Hague Conventions also {{prohibited}} {{the employment of}} [...] "arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering". The Japanese government cited this prohibition on 10 August 1945 after submitting a letter of protest to the United States denouncing the use of atomic bombs. However, the prohibition only applied to weapons as lances with a barbed head, irregularly shaped bullets, projectiles filled with glass, {{the use of any}} substance on bullets that would tend unnecessarily to inflame a wounded inflicted by them, along with grooving bullet tips or the creation of soft point bullets by filing off the ends of the <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> on full metal jacketed bullets.|$|E
60|$|After {{a second}} night {{spent in the}} stage-coach on that lonely and desolate {{mountain}} road where we were now snow-bound, I arose early in the morning, {{and went into the}} forest to collect some fuel; and while thus engaged I made the discovery that the snow was covered with a hard crust which would bear my weight. After the storm had ceased the day before, the sun had shone brightly and the temperature had moderated very much, so that the surface of the snow had slightly thawed. During the night it became cold again, and this surface froze into a <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> of ice. When I found I could walk where I pleased, my spirits rose, and I immediately set out to view the situation. The aspect of the road gave me no encouragement. The snowfall had been a heavy one, but {{had it not been for}} the high wind which accompanied it, it would have thrown but moderate difficulties in the way of our rescue. Reaching a point which commanded a considerable view along the side of the mountain, I could see that in many places the road was completely lost to sight on account of the great snow-drifts piled up on it. I then walked to the point where the two roads met, and crossing over, I climbed a slight rise in the ground which had cut off my view in this direction, and found myself in a position from which I could look directly down the side of the mountain below the road.|$|E

40|$|Friction and wear-induced {{mechanical}} failures may {{be controlled}} {{to extend the}} life of tribological components through the interposition of selected solid materials between contacting surfaces. Thin solid films of soft and hard materials are appropriate to lower friction and enhance the wear resistance of precision tribo-elements. Tribological characteristics of thin <b>hard</b> <b>coats</b> deposited on a variety of ferrous and non-ferrous substrates were tested. The thin <b>hard</b> <b>coats</b> used were titanium nitride films deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering of metallic titanium. High contact stress, low speed tests showed wear rate reductions of one or more magnitude, even with films a few micrometers in thickness. Low contact stress, high speed tests carried out under rather severe test conditions showed that thin films of TiN afforded significant friction reduction and wear protection. Thin <b>hard</b> <b>coats</b> were shown to improve the friction and wear performance of rolling contacts. Satisfactory film-to-substrate adhesion strengths can be obtained with reactive magnetron sputtering. X-ray diffraction and microhardness tests were employed to assess the effectiveness of the sputtering technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The graphite-like carbon (GLC) coating was {{deposited}} onto {{high-speed steel}} (HSS) twist drills by magnetron sputter ion plating technique. The drilling tests {{were performed on}} the ferrous metal under dry cutting conditions. By the analysis and comparison of the flank wear and the drilling forces on drills, the cutting performance of GLC coated HSS tools was researched. The results show that GLC coating with high hardness and low friction coefficient, due to its good adhesion and match with HSS substrate, can significantly improve the cutting performance of HSS twist drills, prolong the tool life, decrease the drilling forces in drilling the ferrous metal. And its cutting performance {{is better than the}} <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> drills in the lower speed, but its thermal stability is inferior to the <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> drills in the higher speed...|$|R

5000|$|Schnauzers have {{a double}} coat. The top or guard coat is wiry, while the {{undercoat}} is soft. Stripping removes the undercoat and stimulates the <b>hard</b> top <b>coat</b> to come in fuller. The undercoat coat should be [...] "stripped" [...] (loose, dead hair is plucked) {{at least twice a}} year. A stripped schnauzer will have a <b>hard</b> wiry <b>coat</b> as described in the breed standard. A shaved pet will lose the <b>hard</b> top <b>coat</b> and only exhibit the soft undercoat.

[...] It {{is meant to}} be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies {{straight}} and close, covering body and legs. The outer <b>coat</b> is <b>hard,</b> wiry and stiff, the undercoat softer. The <b>hardest</b> <b>coats</b> are crinkly or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable.|$|R

50|$|A major {{difference}} with optical cameras {{is that the}} focusing lenses cannot be made of glass, as glass blocks long-wave infrared light. Special materials such as Germanium or Sapphire crystals must be used. Germanium lenses are also quite fragile, so often have a <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> to protect against accidental contact. The higher cost of these special lenses {{is one reason why}} thermographic cameras are more costly.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} hybrids and cultivars with {{different}} colored flowers, usually blue or pink with white additions.

40|$|Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) {{was used}} to grow 200, 300 and 400 nm thick silicon nitride layers (SiN x) on a high {{temperature}} aromatic polyester substrate spin coated with a silica-acrylate hybrid <b>coating</b> (<b>hard</b> <b>coat).</b> Layers deposited without oxygen plasma treatment remained attached to the substrate, while spontaneous buckle delamination of the layer deposited with oxygen plasma treatment was observed directly after layer deposition. This effect was investigated using Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). SIMS analyses showed a considerable increase of silicon oxide by exposing the substrate to oxygen plasma treatment, while AFM showed an increased roughness. Bright-field transmission electron micrographs show {{the presence of a}} particulate SiO 2 layer. The oxygen plasma treatment thus removes the acrylate from the <b>hard</b> <b>coat</b> layer leaving behind the SiO 2 particles leading to lower adhesion and thus to spontaneous buckle delamination. © 2009 Elsevier B.
