50|$|The {{decline in}} the number of debt-for-nature swaps in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of {{commercial}} debt in secondary markets. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.Additionally, other agreements for <b>debt</b> restructuring and <b>cancellation,</b> such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution debt-for-nature swaps make.Also, debt-for-nature swaps have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.|$|R
50|$|If {{the same}} {{property}} had been burdened by recourse debt, and, as above, that property were foreclosed upon in full {{satisfaction of the}} debt, you would get a different result. The gain or loss would be determined {{with reference to the}} fair market value of the property, and the difference between the fair market value and the debt would be COD. (This intuitively makes sense because with recourse <b>debt,</b> any <b>cancellation</b> of the outstanding balance of the debt, after it has been satisfied to the extent of the FMV of the property given up, really is a termination of personal liability to pay that amount, unlike in a situation where the debt is nonrecourse). If the property has a value lower than its basis, then in the case of recourse debt you could get a capital loss and COD ordinary income on the same transaction, netting to the same dollar figure as with nonrecourse debt but potentially much worse for the taxpayer: The taxpayer would not only be burdened with ordinary rather than potentially capital gains, but may have more total income to report, offset only by a capital loss that would be unusable (except to a nominal extent in the case of individuals) if the taxpayer had no other capital transactions for the year. Only {{in the case of a}} taxpayer able to utilize one of the COD exclusions, such as insolvency, could this result be better.|$|R

The Hoover Moratorium seemed reasonable for British Government to hope that this was a step to lead to the end of reparations and war <b>debts.</b> Securing the <b>cancellation</b> or great reduction of those payments was the cardinal point of British policy embodied in Balfour Note of 1922. In the opinion of the British Government the Young Plan of 1929 recognized the inevitable connection between reparations and the war debts contrary to American point of view. After the Laval visit in Washington in October 1931 the debtor Powers were even more strengthened in the assumption that they could hope to obtain parallel concessions from the United States in regard to war debts in exchange for concession to Germany. Therefore it was the objective of the European Conference in Lausanne of 1932. A radical reduction of German reparations was achieved. Under the pressure of France so called gentleman’s agreement was attached which made ratification of the Lausanne Protocol dependent on a satisfactory debt settlement with the United States. The key remained in the American hands. Still Hoover and the U. S. Congress have ruled out the change of the American position toward the outstanding debt. Although the president-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt had suggested a desire to consider the war debt question with the European debtors, nothing has changed. In view of the impossibility of carrying through discussions with America before next maturity, after the cautious considerations, in London have been decided to pay installment debt to the United States with exclusion of the payments resumption under the Funding Agreement. Nevertheless in subsequent years the debt problem remained unresolved and Lausanne Protocol was never ratified. The causes of this were mainly different points of view, lack of mutual understanding between debtors and the creditor and a contradiction between the financial and political approach...|$|R
