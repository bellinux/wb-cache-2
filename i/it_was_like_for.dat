In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E

Finally, she recalled the impact that the women had on the national pastime and the nation as a whole during those perilous times. The same year, the town of Everett dedicated her the Madeline English School, a pre-kindergarten to eighth grade school.|$|E

40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to see rain is phenomenally different from what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot {{be traced back to}} variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R

40|$|When I have a {{conscious}} {{experience of the}} sky, there is a bluish way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to have that experience. We may distinguish two aspects of this “bluish way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me”: (i) the bluish aspect and (ii) the for-me aspect. Let us call the bluish aspect of the experience its qualitative character and the for-me aspect its subjective character. What is this elusive for-me-ness, or subjective character, of conscious experience? In this paper, I examine six different attempts to account for subjective character {{in terms of the}} functional and representational properties of conscious experiences. After arguing against the first five, I defend the sixth. There is something at least prima facie mysterious about conscious experience. The problem of consciousness is the problem of demystifying whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that accounts for the prima facie mysteriousness of conscious experience. This would involve showing that the prima facie mysterious aspects of conscious experience are not super-natural phenomena. That <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> would require “naturalizing ” the relevant aspects of conscious experience, presumably by showing how they could exist in a purely physical world. 1 <b>It</b> <b>is</b> useful to refer to the prima facie mysterious element in conscious experience in terms of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> the subject to have or undergo {{a conscious}} experience. 2 When I have a conscious experience of the sky, there is a bluish way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to have or undergo my experience. 3 I suggest that we distinguish two aspects in this “bluish way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me”: (i) the bluish aspect, which we may call the experience’s qualitative character, and (ii) the for-me aspect, which we may call its subjective character.

5000|$|The most {{important}} aspect of this idea is that human understanding is [...] "state-dependent". For example, when one <b>is</b> angry, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult to understand what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> one to <b>be</b> calm, and vice versa; when one is blindly in love with someone, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult to understand what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> one not to be, (or to imagine the possibility of not being blindly in love in the future). Importantly, an inability to minimize one's gap in empathy can lead to negative outcomes in medical settings (e.g., when a doctor needs to accurately diagnose the physical pain of a patient), in workplace settings (e.g., when an employer needs to assess the need for an employee's bereavement leave) and in juridical settings (e.g., when a judge decides what is an appropriate penalty for a given crime).|$|R
40|$|Metamerism, the {{capacity}} of some colours to present the same colour appearance in some scenes and conditions of illumination, can raise an epistemological problem. In an environment known to be populated by metameric pairs, a perceiver does not know which colour he is perceiving. Metamerism may pose the problem, but colour constancy provides the solution. In varying the conditions of illumination, the col-our will present a different colour appearance, allowing the perceiver to distinguish it from its metameric pair thus allowing him to know which colour he is perceiving. The central question {{of this paper is}} what experience must <b>be</b> <b>like</b> in order <b>for</b> this to be so. I argue that colour experience must have a presentational phenomenology if it can have this epistemic significance. Nature loves to hide. Heraclitus 1. Two conceptions of experience When Norm perceives a red tomato in his garden, Norm perceives the tomato and its sensible qualities—Norm perceives something red, round, and bulgy. Sensible qualities are qualities that objects in the material environment are perceived to have. They are properties, not of experience, but of the objects of experience. Not only does Norm per-ceive the tomato to be red but Norm also perceives the qualitative char-acter of that colour. Norm perceives what red is like—Norm can see that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> reddish and not at all bluish. Moreover, there is a way in which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> Norm to perceive the tomato. What <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> Norm to perceive the red tomato is different from what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> Norm to per-ceive a green tomato. Not only are these experiences numerically dis-tinct they are qualitatively distinct as well. Let us say that this qualitative distinction is a difference in the phe-nomenal character of these experiences. Phenomenal characters, so understood, are properties of experience at least in the minimal sense corresponding {{to the fact that we}} can intelligibly classify experiences on the basis of their phenomenology.

40|$|Abstract: Phenomenal holism is {{the thesis}} that some phenomenal {{characters}} can only be instantiated by experiences that are parts of certain wholes. The first aim {{of this paper is}} to defend phenomenal holism. I argue, moreover, that there are complex intellectual experiences (intellectual gestalts) —such as experiences of grasping a proof—whose parts instantiate holistic phenomenal characters. Proponents of cognitive phenomenology believe that some phenomenal characters can only be instantiated by experiences that are not purely sensory. The second aim {{of this paper is to}} defend cognitive phenomenology. I argue that reflection on intellectual gestalts provides a basis for developing a case for cognitive phenomenology that is immune to many of the worries that beset more familiar arguments for cognitive phenomenology. By a phenomenal character I mean a property that types experiences by what they <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> their subjects. Two experiences have the same phenomenal character just in case what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> a subject to have one is the same as what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> a subject to have the other. There are three different theses about phenomenal characters that will figure in this paper. Here are first pass articulations of them: Phenomenal Intentionality: (PI) Some phenomenal characters can only be instantiated b...|$|R
