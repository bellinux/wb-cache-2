5|$|Starting with Final FantasyVIII, {{the series}} adopted a more photo-realistic look. Like Final FantasyVII, full motion video (FMV) {{sequences}} would have video {{playing in the}} background, with the polygonal characters composited on top. Final FantasyIX returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, {{and in many cases}} slightly upgraded, most of the <b>graphical</b> <b>techniques</b> used in the previous two games. Final FantasyX was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, rather than have 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first Final Fantasy game to introduce voice acting, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, such as the ability to grind on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games {{to make use of the}} cable. It also makes use of <b>graphical</b> <b>techniques</b> such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{presentation}} was well-received, with Electronic Gaming Monthly calling Sonic Advance the best-looking 2D Sonic game. GameSpot praised its detailed scenery and animation, describing them as solid and {{faithful to the}} original Genesis games. Nintendo World Report described its use of <b>graphical</b> <b>techniques</b> as elegant, praising its anime-inspired character animations, and favorably compared them to Super Mario World (1990). The game's music and audio was also praised; GameSpot called it comfortable and catchy. Critics also praised the gameplay, with many favorably comparing it to the original games. IGN admired the clever new ideas, {{such as the ability}} to grind on rails, and determined that Sonic felt better on the GBA, rather than the Genesis. AllGame felt the game relied too much on nostalgia, but felt this was still a [...] "winning formula" [...] and called the game enjoyable. The game's use of the GameCube link cable was widely praised; IGN noted the replay value and variety it offered, and GameSpot called it interesting and felt it made good use of the GBA's connectivity to the GameCube.|$|E

40|$|The Schrodinger {{equation}} for {{an electron}} and a multimode photon field with interactions is solved in the large-phonon-number limit {{by using an}} 2 ̆ 7 integration 2 ̆ 7 method. A <b>graphical</b> <b>technique</b> different from Feynman 2 ̆ 7 s is developed to represent the terms in the solution. By this <b>graphical</b> <b>technique,</b> all interactions between the electron and the multimode photon field are evaluated to any arbitrary order according {{to the number of}} transferred photons. The <b>graphical</b> <b>technique</b> allows one easily to write down the wavefunctions for an electron interacting with a strong photon field which contains an arbitrary number of photon modes. The two-mode case is discussed in detail as an example. Some interesting physical questions arising from the solutions are briefly discussed.
