50|$|In {{practical}} scenarios, a T.38 fax call has {{at least}} part of the call being carried over PSTN, although this is not required by the T.38 definition, and two T.38 devices can send faxes to each other. This particular type of device is called Internet-Aware <b>Fax</b> <b>device,</b> or IAF, and it is capable of initiating or completing a fax call towards the IP network.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{scenario}} where T.38 is used is - T.38 Fax relay - where a T.30 <b>fax</b> <b>device</b> sends a fax over PSTN to a T.38 Fax gateway which converts or encapsulates the T.30 protocol into T.38 data stream. This is {{then sent}} either to a T.38 enabled end point such as fax machine or fax server or another T.38 Gateway that converts {{it back to}} PSTN PCM or analog signal and terminates the fax on a T.30 device.|$|E

40|$|This {{white paper}} briefly {{describes}} the T. 30 and T. 38 protocols, which enable fax {{to be sent}} over an IP network. The T. 30 fax protocol {{was designed to be}} implemented over a network that provides relatively smooth and uninterrupted data flows, and the T. 38 was created to describe the process for sending and receiving faxes in real-time over a VoIP network — an environment that can cause the T. 30 to fail. This background paves the way for a discussion of how the protocols work in a Fax over IP (FoIP) implementation by comparing traditional fax technology — that is, plain old fax, which is a <b>fax</b> <b>device</b> that is not connected to an all-IP enabled fax server — with the more advanced fax option of sending faxes over an IP infrastructure, which also has more security features. This white paper also provides examples of the Dialogic ® Brooktrout ® T. 30 and T. 38 Stacks used in Dialogic ® Brooktrout ® fax products, followed by notable benefits of these enhanced protocols in Brooktrout fax products.

40|$|The Internet's {{use as a}} faxing medium {{allows users}} across continents to {{communicate}} without incurring {{the high costs of}} long-distance phone rates. Geographically dispersed servers connected to local Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN) circumvent the use of international lines by using the Internet instead. This paper proposes an integrated Internet faxing environment, known as FaxPortal, to support different modes of Internet faxing including the use of email, the World Wide Web, and conventional <b>fax</b> <b>devices.</b> FaxPortal's architecture comprises two servers, namely, the Faxing and Fax Receiving Servers. The Faxing Server accepts and converts fax messages into fax-image files for transmission over the Internet. The Fax Receiving Server receives these files and sends them to <b>fax</b> <b>devices</b> over the PSTN. Additionally, FaxPortal has adopted a scheme with three different transportation classes to simplify the support for global fax coverage. 1. INTRODUCTION Fax messages are usually capt [...] ...|$|R

40|$|As fax {{technology}} {{continues to}} evolve, enterprises {{are faced with}} the decision of whether to upgrade their fax solution to V. 34, which represents the latest in fax standards. Nicknamed “V. Fast”, the V. 34 fax standard is heralded as an important development in fax technology. Not only can it send fax data at more than twice the speed of V. 17 (14. 4 kbps), but it also supports fast handshaking, which can cut call setup and session-management time by one-third. <b>Fax</b> <b>devices</b> supporting the V. 34 protocol also can deliver more reliable fax transmissions, requiring fewer resends, under a wider range of line conditions than those supporting older fax standards such as V. 17 and 9. 6 kbps.

50|$|To {{prevent the}} DSL signal from {{entering}} the phone lines into telephones, answering machines, <b>faxes</b> and other <b>devices</b> where it could cause interference, DSL modems come with low pass filters which must be plugged into the phone lines going to all voiceband devices on the same line.

40|$|Objective: {{to perform}} a complex study of typical plasma sex hormone changes and their {{functional}} significance in males with severe concomitant injury (SCI). Subjects and methods. Fifty-nine males aged 18 — 49 years who had SCI {{were enrolled in the}} study. The admission severity was an APACHE II score of 18. 6 ± 2. 4. According to the outcome of the disease, all the patients were divided into 2 groups: A) survivors; B) deceased persons. A control comprised 12 healthy male donors aged 19 - 36 years, in whom the levels of 8 sex steroids were measured. The standard procedures were used to comparatively analyze the concentrations of pituitary reproductive hormones and aldosterone. Hormonal concentrations were studied over time on posttraumatic days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15. The plasma hormone profile was examined by test kits (BSL, USA) on a Stat <b>Fax</b> 2100 <b>device</b> (Awareness Technology Inc., USA) for enzyme immunoassay. Prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P), 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OH-P), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstendione (A), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estrone (E 1), estradiol (E 2), and aldosterone were determined. Results. The complex study of phasic changes in the profile of 11 plasma sex hormones was first conducted in males in the posttraumatic period. Moreover, the typical plasma hormonal changes were elevated prolactin levels and their phasic variations, normal LH and FSH levels with a tendency for further phasic LH changes and FSH reduction. After the injury, the plasma concentration of P was increased and that of 17 -OH-P was decreased. The levels of A and DHEA-S varied in the normal range with a tendency for DHEA-S to be lower during the process. In the posttraumatic period, the plasma content of T and DHT was substantially reduced and that of E 1 and E 2 was increased. The deceased patients generally showed higher levels of A, DHEA-S, and estrogens as a reflection of dysregulatory pathology and complications. The changes revealed in hormonal levels are of significance in understanding the pathogenesis of SCT and its sequels. This may serve as a basis for the development of new therapy methods using sex hormones as adaptogens in the postresuscitative period.
