5000|$|Investigation {{committees}} : The Plenum may establish investigation committees {{consisting of}} MPs. The committees {{are called to}} investigate issues of public interest. Decisions on the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> are taken by the absolute majority of members present. The majority cannot nonetheless be less than 2/5 {{of the total number}} of MPs. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee assesses the collected evidence and drafts a reasoned report on its findings, while also elaborating on any minority views expressed. With the proposal of 1/5 {{of the total number of}} MPs the findings of the committee are registered to the order of the day.|$|E

50|$|Sir Kenneth Clark, then Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery, was {{the driving}} force behind <b>the</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee.</b> <b>The</b> advent <b>of</b> World War II saw many artists cease working and lose their incomes as {{commercial}} galleries closed, private commissions ceased and the art schools reduced their teaching or closed altogether. This led Clarke to fear that there would not be a contemporary artistic, visual record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. His lobbying for Government support for artists during the conflict directly led to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> WAAC. Whilst <b>the</b> primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> was propaganda and organising art exhibitions in Britain and America to raise morale and promote Britain's image abroad, Clarke later admitted that he also hoped that the scheme might also prevent artists from being killed on front line service.|$|R
