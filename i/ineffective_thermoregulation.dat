50|$|On average B. insularis {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 70 cm and is known to reach 118 cm. The color pattern {{consists}} of a pale yellowish-brown ground color, overlaid {{with a series of}} dorsal blotches that may be triangular or quadrangular, broad or narrow, and alternating or opposite along the dorsal median. In captivity, this yellowish color often becomes darker, which {{may be the result of}} poor circulation caused by <b>ineffective</b> <b>thermoregulation.</b> A banded pattern results when the pattern is opposite. The head lacks a well-defined post-orbital stripe. The belly is a uniform pale yellow or cream.|$|E
