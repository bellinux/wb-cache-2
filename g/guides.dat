5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon {{publishes a}} variety of study {{materials}} for the objective events, the profits from which support the program. The Resource <b>Guides</b> and the Basic <b>Guides</b> constitute {{the majority of the}} USAD corpus. An art reproduction booklet and music CD contain a particular year's relevant pieces and are issued separately from the Resource <b>Guides.</b> Study <b>guides</b> are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject. These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the Resource <b>Guides.</b> USAD also offered Research <b>Guides</b> until 2010, which outlined the basics of what students ought to research. However, in the 2010–2011 competition season, USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research-based questions from the competitions.|$|E

5|$|Basic <b>Guides</b> were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource <b>Guides,</b> {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the Basic <b>Guides</b> were incorporated into the year's Resource <b>Guides.</b>|$|E
