40|$|Abstract—Existing {{applications}} {{solving problems}} of full-strokes {{are based on}} using non-synchronized telescopic guides working with mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic motion drives [1]-[4]. In these cases the <b>full-stroke</b> in general {{is not possible to}} position and control reliably. One of the disadvantage of non-synchronized full-strokes using especially double-sided <b>full-stroke</b> is uncontrollable movement of extending parts, which can stagnate in various positions during the working cycle. Creating of a synchronized <b>full-stroke</b> using mechanical kinematic structure between particular components of the telescopic unit can solve these problems mentioned above.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the adaptations in leg muscle metabolism of swimmers following a six-week, leg-kicking swimming training program Fifteen male competitive swimmers {{were randomly assigned to}} an experimental group (E; n= 8) and a control group (C; n= 7). E swimmers performed normal leg-kicking training three times per week, whereas C swimmers performed reduced leg-kicking training (20 % and 4 % of weekly training distance, respectively). Before and after the training program, all swimmers performed a 200 m leg-kicking and a 400 m <b>full-stroke</b> freestyle time trial and a dry-land exercise test during which peak oxygen uptake, oxygen uptake at 60 W and exercise intensity at ventilatory threshold were measured. After training, there were improvements in leg-kicking time in 200 m (s; − 6. 0 ± 2. 0 %, p = 0. 044), oxygen uptake at 60 Watts (L·min− 1; − 20. 4 ± 3. 0 %, p = 0. 035) and exercise intensity at ventilatory threshold (Watts; + 28. 0 ± 5. 0 %, p = 0. 023) in E swimmers, whereas time in 400 m and peak oxygen uptake remained unchanged (p > 0. 05). There were no changes in any of the measures for C swimmers (P > 0. 05). These results suggest that normal leg-kicking swimming training positively affects the conditioning of the legs, but does not improve aerobic power during the dry-land, leg-kicking exercise test or middle-distance, <b>full-stroke,</b> swimming performance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method for}} characterizing smart {{materials}} actuators in <b>full-stroke</b> static and low frequency dynamic regimes is presented. At first, static and dynamic linear {{models of the}} piezoelectric actuator response under electro-mechanical excitation are discussed. Then, a thorough static and dynamic experimental characterization on a typical large-stroke piezoelectric actuator is performed. The measurements indicated a strong dependence of the actuator stiffness and piezoelectric properties on the electromechanical loading. The comparison of the model with the measured behavior is performed and the material coefficients are tuned to locally match the observed nonlinear behavior. The comparison also allows the identification of key parameters of the induced-strain actuator model. These parameters are necessary for design optimization towards maximum mechanical energy output and minimum electrical power input. The paper provides useful basic data {{for the design of}} actuation systems incorporating active materials actuators...|$|E
40|$|Context: Forward {{propulsion}} in freestyle swimming {{is predominantly}} achieved through arm action. Few studies have assessed {{the effects of}} arm training on arm power and swimming performance, yet there have not been any investigations {{on the effects of}} arms-only swimming training on swimming performance and physiological responses to arm exercise. Purpose: To investigate the changes in arms-only and <b>full-stroke</b> swimming performance, movement economy and aerobic power after an arms-only swimming training program. Methods: Fifteen male county level swimmers were assigned either to an experimental (ES, n = 8) or control group (CS, n = 7). For six weeks ES performed arms-only freestyle swimming exercises for 20 % of their weekly training distance three times per week, whereas CS performed their usual swimming training. Before and after the training program, both groups performed a) two time trials, 186 m using arms-only (186 ARMS) and 372 m using <b>full-stroke</b> (372 FULL) freestyle swimming, and b) an incremental arm-pulling exercise test. The time to complete the trials was recorded. Peak oxygen uptake (V O 2 peak), peak exercise intensity (EI peak) submaximal oxygen uptake at 60 W (V O 2 - 60) and exercise intensity at ventilatory threshold (VT W) were determined, from the exercise test. Results: After training, ES had improved in 186 ARMS (- 14. 2 Â± 3. 6 %, P =. 03). V O 2 - 60 (- 22. 5 Â± 2. 3 %, P =. 04), EI peak (+ 17. 8 Â± 4. 2 %, P =. 03), and VT W (+ 18. 9 Â± 2. 3 %, P =. 02), but not in V O 2 peak (P = ' 09) or in 372 FULL (P =. 07). None of the measures changed in CS (P >. 05). Conclusion: Arms-only swimming training at 20 % of the weekly training distance is an effective method to improve arm conditioning during the preparatory phase of the annual training cycle.

40|$|Mechanical Technology Incorporated (MTI) {{performed}} {{acceptance testing}} on the Space Power Research Engine (SPRE), which demonstrated satisfactory operation and sufficient reliability for delivery to NASA Lewis Research Center. The unit produced 13. 5 kW PV power with an efficiency of 22 percent versus design goals of 28. 8 kW PV power {{and efficiency of}} 28 percent. Maximum electric power was only 8 kWe due to lower alternator efficiency. One of the major shortcomings of the SPRE was linear alternator efficiency, which was only 70 percent compared to a design value of 90 percent. It was determined from static tests that the major cause for the efficiency shortfall was {{the location of the}} magnetic structure surrounding the linear alternator. Testing of an alternator configuration without a surrounding magnetic structure on a linear dynamometer confirmed earlier static test results. Linear alternator efficiency improved from 70 percent to over 90 percent. Testing of the MTI SPRE was also performed with hydrodynamic bearings and achieved <b>full-stroke,</b> stable operation. This testing indicated that hydrodynamic bearings may be useful in free piston Stirling engines. An important factor in achieving stable operation at design stroke was isolating a portion of the bearing length from the engine pressure variations. In addition, the heat pipe heater head design indicates that integration of a Stirling engine with a heat source can be performed via heat pipes. This design provides a baseline against which alternative designs can be measured...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationship}} between oxygen uptake and heart rate in response to whole-body simulated swimming. Nine club swimmers (mean ± SD; age: 20 ± 4 years, stature: 1. 68 ± 11 m, mass: 63 ± 12 kg) signed an informed consent and participated in the study. All subjects performed a simulated front crawl combined arm-pulling and leg-kicking incremental exercise test to exhaustion using a swim bench and a leg-kicking ergometer. Oxygen uptake (VO 2) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at 15 s intervals and at exhaustion (VO 2 peak; HRpeak). The HR at ventilatory threshold (VT) was determined (VTHR) and the VO 2 /HR relationship explored. The mean ± SD for VO 2 peak and HRpeak values were 3. 3 ± 0. 4 L·min- 1 and 174 ± 8 b·min- 1 respectively, whereas VTHR occurred at 162 ± 5 b·min- 1 at a predicted VO 2 of 2. 4 ± 0. 4 L·min- 1. The relationship between VO 2 and HR was shown to be linear in all subjects (r= 0. 94; P< 0. 05). Previously published data have demonstrated linear relationships between HR/EI and VO 2 /EI (r= 0. 99 and r= 0. 98 respectively; P< 0. 05) for simulated arm-pulling exercise. The peak values for simulated front-crawl arm-pulling and leg-kicking exercise were: 2. 85 ± 0. 26 L·min- 1, 171 ± 3 b·min- 1 and 3. 1 L·min- 1, 170 ± 3 b·min- 1, respectively. Our results suggest that the VO 2 and HR responses to <b>full-stroke</b> simulated swimming are higher than the respective responses to arm-pulling or leg-kicking separately. This type of whole-body ergometry might be useful for assessing maximal and submaximal cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in swimmers...|$|E
40|$|The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) are {{currently}} developing a high efficient, long life, free piston Stirling convertor {{for use as}} an advanced spacecraft power system for future NASA missions. As part of this development, a Stirling Technology Demonstrator Convertor (TDC), developed by Stirling Technology Company (STC) for DOE, was vibration tested at GRC s Structural Dynamics Laboratory (SDU 7735) in November- December 1999. This testing demonstrated that the Stirling TDC is able to withstand the harsh random vibration (20 to 2000 Hertz) seen during a typical spacecraft launch and survive with no structural damage or functional power performance degradation, thereby enabling its usage in future spacecraft power systems. The Stirling Vibration Test Team at NASA GRC and STC personnel conducted tests on a single 55 electric watt TDC. The purpose was to characterize the TDC s structural response to vibration and determine if the TDC could survive the vibration criteria established by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for launch environments. The TDC was operated at <b>full-stroke</b> and full power conditions during the vibration testing. The TDC was tested in two orientations, with the direction of vibration parallel and perpendicular to the TDC s moving components (displacer and piston). The TDC successfully passed a series of sine and random vibration tests. The most severe test was a 12. 3 Grms random vibration test (peak vibration level of 0. 2 g 2 /Hz from 50 to 250 Hertz) with test durations of 3 minutes per axis. The random vibration test levels were chosen to simulate, with margin, the maximum anticipated launch vibration conditions. As {{a result of this}} very successful vibration testing and successful evaluations in other key technical readiness areas, the Stirling power system is now considered a viable technology for future application for NASA spacecraft missions. Possible usage of the Stirling power system would be to supply on- board electric spacecraft power for future NASA Deep-Space Missions, performing as an attractive alternative to Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG). Usage of the Stirling technology is also being considered as the electric power source for future Mars rovers, whose mission profiles may exclude the use of photovoltaic power systems (such as exploring at high Martian latitudes or for missions of lengthy durations). GRC s Thermo-Mechanical Systems Branch (5490) provides Stirling technology expertise under a Space Act Agreement with the DOE. Additional vibration testing, by GRC s Structural Systems Dynamics Branch (7733, is planned to continue to demonstrate the Stirling power system s vibration capability as its technology and flight system designs progress...|$|E
