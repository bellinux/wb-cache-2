5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> all the stuff people are saying about him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{wrote of}} the episode, [...] "This far into the show’s run, {{shifting}} to a much more dramatic bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late." [...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson. I <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down {{the path of least resistance}} and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E

500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Welcome Back, Carter", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club's Rowan Kaiser noted the apparent lack of guest stars in the episode, adding, [...] "I can't help but feel [...] {{is a good thing}} in for Family Guy." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised the [...] "shock humor" [...] in the limousine jousting scene, but compared Carter's catchphrases to [...] "the kind of groan-inducing meta-humor that [...] The Cleveland Show aims for." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C rating, the second best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Cleveland Got His Groove Back" [...] and tying with the American Dad! episode [...] "Son of Stan". In a slightly more neutral review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's cutaways, stating that they [...] "came back with a vengeance this week." [...] Hughes went on to comment negatively on the scene involving Carter being woken up and hinting at incest with his daughter, noting, [...] "It's weird that while the pedophile character of Herbert doesn't bother me at all, this potential admission really does. Maybe because it adds an element of incest, or seemed more genuine than Herbert's over-the-top antics. But really, it's just another throwaway gag in the world of Seth MacFarlane." [...] Actor Jonathan Lipnicki, who was parodied in the episode, responded to his portrayal by stating, [...] "I don't <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> what they said on Family Guy. It was all in good fun, I've worked on that show [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E

We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding.

2500|$|Self-esteem is {{attractive}} {{as a social}} psychological construct because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of certain outcomes, such as academic achievement, happiness, satisfaction in marriage and relationships, and criminal behaviour. Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension (for example, [...] "I believe I am a good writer and feel happy about that") or a global extent (for example, [...] "I believe I am a bad person, and <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> myself in general"). Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic ("trait" [...] self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations ("state" [...] self-esteem) also exist.

2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing".
