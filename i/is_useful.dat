5|$|Biostratigraphy, {{the use of}} fossils to {{work out}} the chronological order in which rocks were formed, <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> to both paleontologists and geologists. Biogeography studies the spatial {{distribution}} of organisms, and is also linked to geology, which explains how Earth's geography has changed over time.|$|E

50|$|Analgesics and nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> to {{a limited}} extent. Corticosteroid injections may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> when the shoulder is acutely inflamed but otherwise <b>are</b> not generally <b>useful</b> except for the temporary relief of pain.|$|R

5|$|Bird {{collections}} are curated repositories of scientific specimens consisting {{of birds and}} their parts. They are a research resource for ornithology, the science of birds, and for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds <b>is</b> <b>useful.</b> These {{collections are}} archives of avian diversity and serve the diverse needs of scientific researchers, artists, and educators.|$|E
5|$|Cases of {{epilepsy}} may {{be organized}} into epilepsy syndromes by the specific {{features that are}} present. These features include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> as it helps determine the underlying causes {{as well as what}} anti-seizure medication should be tried.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> as a {{gamma ray}} source {{because it can}} be {{produced}} in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33MeV.|$|E
40|$|Purpose and methods: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} reformation of pre-graduate medical education on the students of years 2005 - 2007, we analyzed a questionnaire targeting those students after graduation. Results: General education has a low degree of usefulness for the students. Basic medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> as a preparation for clinical medicine. Clinical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> in terms of knowledge and skill, but {{not in terms of}} attitude. Both general education and clinical education <b>were</b> somewhat <b>useful</b> for the older graduates. Among the new educational methods, only OSCE <b>was</b> <b>useful.</b> Conclusion: Reformation of pre-graduate medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> especially in regard to clinical skill education...|$|R

25|$|Trigonometric {{functions}} also {{prove to}} <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> {{in the study}} of general periodic functions. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light waves.|$|R
5|$|Convolution {{is used to}} add two {{independent}} random variables defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> {{as a kind of}} domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition is a kind of range-side addition.|$|E
5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer test <b>is</b> <b>useful.</b> In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
50|$|Projections include maximum {{intensity}} projection (MIP), which enhance areas of high radiodensity, and so <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for angiographic studies. MIP reconstructions tend to enhance air spaces so <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for assessing lung structure.|$|R

50|$|A common {{example for}} when partial {{reconfiguration}} would <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>is</b> {{the case of}} a communication device. If the device is controlling multiple connections, some of which require encryption, it would <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to <b>be</b> able to load different encryption cores without bringing the whole controller down.|$|R
5|$|Helium, {{mixed with}} a heavier gas such as xenon, <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in {{the diagnosis}} and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
40|$|The {{proposition}} that electrical noise could <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>is</b> anathema to the designers of electronics and communication systems, who {{usually have a}} mission to eradicate as much noise as possible. One needs to look outside the parameters of conventional assumptions and perspectives for situations where electrical noise can <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> Two topics <b>are</b> sufficient to illustrate affirmative answers to the posed question are stochastic resonance and dithering. Electrical noise is usually modeled by random variables. A second perspective that {{is quite different from}} the first is that randomness can <b>be</b> <b>useful,</b> and that electrical noise may <b>be</b> a <b>useful</b> source of randomness. ...|$|R

Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> in carbon monoxide detectors.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} vision, {{digital images}} are partitioned into small square pixels, {{each of which}} has its own color. The dual graph of this subdivision into squares has a vertex per pixel and an edge between pairs of pixels that share an edge; it <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for applications including clustering of pixels into connected regions of similar colors.|$|E
