50|$|Homogenization {{of tissue}} in {{solution}} is often performed simultaneously with cell lysis.

30|$|With {{the advent}} of bipolar {{electrosurgical}} systems using <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions,</b> fluid deficits > 1000  mL will be tolerated by healthy women but a safe, upper limit is not still well defined and will depend upon an individual’s size, age and medical fitness.|$|R
30|$|Some {{specific}} maintenance {{solutions are}} commercially available, {{but they are}} far from ideal. There {{is a lot of}} debate whether isotonic or hypotonic maintenance solutions should be used. Data in children showed that hypotonic solutions carry the risk of hyponatremia and neurologic complications [32, 33]. However, studies in adults are scarce and indicate that administration of <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> will result in a more positive fluid balance as compared to hypotonic solutions [34]. This was confirmed in a recent pilot study in healthy volunteers showing that <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> caused lower urine output, characterized by decreased aldosterone concentrations indicating (unintentional) volume expansion, than hypotonic solutions. Despite their lower sodium and potassium content, hypotonic fluids were not associated with hyponatremia or hypokalemia [24].|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which {{is close to the}} concentration in the blood (isotonic). Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> often used for large-volume fluid replacement. The choice of fluids may also depend on the chemical properties of the medications being given.|$|E
50|$|Osmosis is the {{movement}} of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. The net movement of water molecules through a partially permeable membrane from a solution of high water potential to an area of low water potential. A cell with a less negative water potential will draw in water but this depends on other factors as well such as solute potential (pressure in the cell e.g. solute molecules) and pressure potential (external pressure e.g. cell wall). There are three types of Osmosis solutions: the <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution,</b> hypotonic solution, and hypertonic solution. <b>Isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> is when the extracellular solute concentration is balanced with the concentration inside the cell. In the <b>Isotonic</b> <b>solution,</b> the water molecules still moves between the solutions, but the rates are the same from both directions, thus the water movement is balanced between {{the inside of the}} cell as well as the outside of the cell. A hypotonic solution is when the solute concentration outside the cell is lower than the concentration inside the cell. In hypotonic solutions, the water moves into the cell, down its concentration gradient (from higher to lower water concentrations). That can cause the cell to swell. Cells that don't have a cell wall, such as animal cells, could burst in this solution. A hypertonic solution is when the solute concentration is higher (think of hyper - as high) than the concentration inside the cell. In hypertonic solution, the water will move out, causing the cell to shrink.|$|E
50|$|Cell {{walls are}} made {{of a variety of}} polysaccharides. Protoplasts can be made by {{degrading}} cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading enzymes:During and subsequent to digestion of the cell wall, the protoplast becomes very sensitive to osmotic stress. This means cell wall digestion and protoplast storage must be done in an <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> to prevent rupture of the plasma membrane.|$|E
30|$|These {{thresholds}} {{apply to}} otherwise healthy fit women. However, {{in the elderly}} or those women with co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and renal impairment, lower thresholds should apply and {{it is suggested that}} upper fluid deficit levels of 750  ml for hypotonic solutions and 1500  ml for <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> [4].|$|R
40|$|In this work, vacuum {{impregnated}} apple discs {{with different}} <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> (sucrose and trehalose) were equilibrated during osmotic dehydration (55 °Brix glucose at 40 °C). Changes in sample composition (water and soluble solid contents), weight and volume are analysed. A mathematical model is proposed {{to describe and}} quantify the outflow {{of water from the}} protoplast as well as the visco-elastic behaviour of the cell. Good correspondence between simulated and measured data of non impregnated samples and samples impregnated with <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> of sucrose or trehalose during long term osmotic dehydration is obtained. Fitted values of the cell permeability correspond well with tabulated values. Furthermore, also the obtained values of the parameters describing the mechanical properties of the cell wall and Hectian strands seem to reflect the observed structural development of these structures for the different treated samples well...|$|R

50|$|Ringer's {{solution}} {{is a solution}} of several salts dissolved in water {{for the purpose of}} creating an <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> relative to the body fluids of an animal. Ringer's solution typically contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate, with the last used to balance the pH. Other additions can include chemical fuel sources for cells, including ATP and dextrose, as well as antibiotics and antifungals.|$|E
50|$|The second {{methodology}} {{is the use}} of an anaesthetic. The preferred {{solution for}} meiobenthologists is isotonic magnesium chloride (7.5g MgCl2 · 6H2O in 100 ml of distilled water). The sample is immersed in the <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> and left for a period of 15 min, after which the meiofauna are shaken free of the substrate and again filtered out through a 45 μm mesh and immediately returned to fresh filtered seawater.|$|E
50|$|Parathyroid auto {{transplantation}} {{is part of}} {{the treatment}} when a patient has hyperparathyroidism and three or four parathyroid glands were already removed, but during the surgery one of the glands (in the case of the removal of three) is relocated at another part of the body to make, the procedure less risky another procedure. In the case of complete parathyroidectomy, a half gland is cryopreserved. In case the patient suffers hypoparathyroidism. If this happens the extracted parathyroid is relocated to another place of the body for example the forearm. Parathyroid auto transplantation begins with parathyroid tissue extraction, which must be preserved into a cold <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> until the patient needs it. Research has shown that parathyroid tissue can function at subcutaneous level until the transplantation. If this is not possible, the most common procedure is to create a small pocket of muscle, tissue at least 2 cm deep by separating the muscular fibers. Then the parathyroid tissue is placed into and closed by suturing the area. After the extraction the tissue might be processed at the laboratory, as soon as possible. Once at the laboratory the tissue sample is placed at a frozen petri dish where it is cut into small pieces (approximately 1-2 mm). The small pieces are placed into test tubes and filled with a solution in three parts one at 20% of autologous serum (about 0.6 ml) and the other part of <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> at 20% (about 0.6 ml) then a solution of 2 ml of polypropylene and mixed gently. Then is placed into a container at -70 °C for a night then finally the container passes through the phase of liquid or vapor nitrogen immersion and is kept there until needed. When it is needed the sample is taken out of the nitrogen and placed into a bath of water at 37 °C until the ice is melted almost completely except for the samples core. Then 0.5 ml of the melted solution is removed and replaced for fresh <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E

50|$|Osmosis is {{the process}} in which water flows from an area with a low solute concentration, to an {{adjacent}} area with a higher solute concentration until equilibrium between the two areas is reached. All cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane which permits {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} cell while also limiting the flow of solutes. In hypertonic solutions, water flows out of the cell which decreases the cell's volume. When in a hypotonic solution, water flows into the membrane and increases the cell's volume. When in an <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution,</b> water flows in and out of the cell at an equal rate.|$|E
50|$|L-forms can be {{generated}} in the laboratory from many bacterial species that usually have cell walls, such as Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. This is done by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis with antibiotics or treating the cells with lysozyme, an enzyme that digests cell walls. The L-forms are generated in a culture medium {{that is the same}} osmolarity as the bacterial cytosol (an <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution),</b> which prevents cell lysis by osmotic shock. L-form strains can be unstable, tending to revert to the normal form of the bacteria by regrowing a cell wall, but this can be prevented by long-term culture of the cells under the same conditions that were used to produce them.|$|E
5000|$|Intercalation as a {{mechanism}} of interaction between cationic, planar, polycyclic aromatic systems of the correct size (on {{the order of a}} base pair) was first proposed by Leonard Lerman in 1961. One proposed mechanism of intercalation is as follows: In aqueous <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution,</b> the cationic intercalator is attracted electrostatically {{to the surface of the}} polyanionic DNA. The ligand displaces a sodium and/or magnesium cation present in the [...] "condensation cloud" [...] of such cations that surrounds DNA (to partially balance the sum of the negative charges carried by each phosphate oxygen), thus forming a weak electrostatic association with the outer surface of DNA. From this position, the ligand diffuses along the surface of the DNA and may slide into the hydrophobic environment found between two base pairs that may transiently [...] "open" [...] to form an intercalation site, allowing the ethidium to move away from the hydrophilic (aqueous) environment surrounding the DNA and into the intercalation site. The base pairs transiently form such openings due to energy absorbed during collisions with solvent molecules.|$|E
40|$|The effects {{produced}} by prefixation treatments on cells in metaphase from 10 day mouse fctuscs and from several embryonic {{stages of the}} frog were investigated. The technical value {{of some of these}} prctrcatmcnts is noted. Pretreatment with <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> (both ionic and non-ionic {{in the case of the}} mouse, ionic only in the frog) generally produced a similar effect, viz., chromosomal swelling with little effect on the spindlc. A notable exception is provided by frog embryos preceding the ncurula stage; spindle disorganization without chromosomal swelling was {{produced by}} pretrcatmcnt in <b>isotonic</b> modified Niu-Twitty <b>solution,</b> containing no divalcnt cations. Pretreatment with hypotonic solutions (both ionic and non-ionic in the case of the mouse, ionic only in the frog) generally produced several major effects, viz., dcspiralization of chromosomes, chromatid separation, and spindle disorganization. The conclusion is drawn from the mouse data that, in order to produce thcse effects, pretreating solutions must bc of low osmotic pressure. Low ionic strength alone (e. g., <b>isotonic</b> sucrose <b>solutions)</b> is not sufficient. As diffcrcntiation of frog embryos progressed, pretreatments either of longer duration or with solutions of increasing degrees of hypotonicity were required to produce comparable intensities of the same effects. Many of the effects on mctaphases produced by hypotonic pretreatment of frog embryos wcrc reversible by subsequent exposure to <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions.</b> The significance of results presented hcrc is discussed briefly with respect to some current considerations of the macromolccular structure of chromosomes. ...|$|R
40|$|When a {{quantity}} of <b>isotonic</b> dextrose <b>solution</b> equivalent to about one fourth the blood volume is injected intravenously into an unanesthetized dog, diuresis ensues and within from 1. 5 to 2. 5 hours the volume of urine secreted approximates that of the injected solution. On the other hand, if an <b>isotonic</b> sodium chloride <b>solution</b> is injected instead of the dextrose solution urine secretion is much less affected. A possible explanation for this difference may be stated as follows: When an <b>isotonic</b> dextrose <b>solution</b> is injectedthere is probably no esse'ltial disturbance in the equilibrium of those substances in the body which affect the water balance of the organism.

40|$|Cryomicroscopy of protoplasts {{isolated}} from nonacclimated (NA) rye leaves (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) {{revealed that the}} predominant form of injury following cooling to the minimum temperature for 50 % survival (LT 50) (− 5 °C) was expansion-induced lysis of the plasma membrane during warming and thawing of the suspending medium when the decreasing osmolality resulted in osmotic expansion of the protoplasts. When cooled to temperatures below the LT 50, the predominant form of injury was loss of osmotic responsiveness following cooling so that the protoplasts were osmotically inactive during warming. Only a low incidence (< 10 %) of expansion-induced lysis was observed in protoplasts {{isolated from}} acclimated (ACC) leaves, and the predominant form of injury following cooling to the LT 50 (− 25 °C) was loss of osmotic responsiveness. The tolerable surface area increment (TSAI) which resulted in lysis of 50 % of a population (TSAI 50) of NA protoplasts osmotically expanded from <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> was 1122 ± 172 square micrometers. Similar values were obtained when the protoplasts were osmotically expanded from hypertonic solutions. The TSAI determined from cryomicroscopic measurements of individual NA protoplasts {{was similar to the}} TSAI 50 values obtained from osmotic manipulation. The TSAI 50 of ACC protoplasts expanded from <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> (2145 ± 235 square micrometers) was approximately double that of NA protoplasts and increased following osmotic contraction. Osmotic contractions were readily reversible upon return to <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions.</b> During freeze-induced dehydration, endocytotic vesicles formed in NA protoplasts whereas exocytotic extrusions formed on the surface of ACC protoplasts. During osmotic expansion following thawing of the suspending medium, the endocytotic vesicles remained in the cytoplasm of NA protoplasts and the protoplasts lysed before their original volume and surface area were regained. In contrast, the exocytotic extrusions were drawn back into the surface of ACC protoplasts as the protoplasts regained their original volume and surface area...|$|R
5000|$|Primary hepatocytes are {{commonly}} used in cell biological and biopharmaceutical research. In vitro model systems based on hepatocytes have been of great help {{to better understand the}} role of hepatocytes in (patho)physiological processes of the liver. In addition, pharmaceutical industry has heavily relied on the use of hepatocytes in suspension or culture to explore mechanisms of drug metabolism and even predict in vivo drug metabolism. For these purposes, hepatocytes are usually isolated from animal or human [...] whole liver or liver tissue by collagenase digestion, which is a two-step process. In the first step, the liver is placed in an <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution,</b> in which calcium is removed to disrupt cell-cell tight junctions by the use of a calcium chelating agent. Next, a solution containing collagenase is added to separate the hepatocytes from the liver stroma. This process creates a suspension of hepatocytes, which can be seeded in multi-well plates and cultured for many days or even weeks. For optimal results, culture plates should first be coated with an extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen, Matrigel) to promote hepatocyte attachment (typically within 1-3 hr after seeding) and maintenance of the hepatic phenotype. In addition, and overlay with an additional layer of extracellular matrix is often performed to establish a sandwich culture of hepatocytes. The application of a sandwich configuration supports prolonged maintenance of hepatocytes in culture. Freshly-isolated hepatocytes that are not used immediately can be cryopreserved and stored. They do not proliferate in culture. Hepatocytes are intensely sensitive to damage during the cycles of cryopreservation including freezing and thawing. Even after the addition of classical cryoprotectants there is still damage done while being cryopreserved. Nevertheless, recent cryopreservation and resuscitation protocols support application of cryopreserved hepatocytes for most biopharmaceutical applications.|$|E

Women with a normal AF index and gestational age between 33 and 36 weeks without maternal complications were randomized into three groups &# 91;isotonic solution (Gatorade®), water, control&# 93;. The <b>isotonic</b> <b>solution</b> and water groups were instructed to drink 1. 5 L of the respective solution and the control group was instructed to drink 200 mL water over a period of 2 to 4 h. AF index was measured before and after hydration by Doppler ultrasonography. The investigator performing the AF index measurement was blind to the subject&# 8217;s group.

Segments of the ileum of anesthetized rats have been perfused i ~ v/vo with unbuffered NaC 1 <b>solutions</b> or <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> of NaC 1 and mannitol. Kinetic analysis of movements of Na ~ and CP s has permitted determination of the eCflux and influx of Na and C 1.

Net water flux from <b>isotonic</b> <b>solutions</b> with varying NaC 1 concentration was directly dependent on net solute flux. The amount of water absorbed was equivalent to the amount required to maintain the absorbed solute at isotonic concentration.

The standard sucrose hemolysis test employed a mixture of buffered sucrose solution and small amounts of compatible, normal sernm and of test cells. 13 A simpler screening procedure was provided by the “sugar water ” test in which one part of citrated, oxalated or defibrinated whole blood was added to nine parts of 10 % “sugar water. ” 1 The use of heparin or Na 2 EDTA as blood anti-coagulants was unsatisfactory since such frequently led to false negative results in PNH. Further experience presented in this report indicates the advisability of placing additional restrictions on the simple whole blood screening tests to improve discrimination between PNH and certain other hematologic dis-orders. At the same time the validity of the confirmatory sucrose hemolvsis test for the diagnosis of PNH has been further substantiated...|$|R
