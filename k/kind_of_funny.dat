500|$|Charles Bramesco of The A.V. Club {{recommended}} the film, writing that [...] "The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity. It’s {{hard not to}} respect", and noted the film's [...] "enduring appeal". Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances [...] "a little rough", and wrote [...] "If Killer Klowns isn't especially scary, it's only <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif". Dread Central gave the film three {{out of a possible}} five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film [...] "is the KING of 80's B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads". John Gugie of HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of 3/5, calling it [...] "a hit or miss for horror and sci-fi fans".|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{original}} first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player [...] "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." [...] Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: [...] "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." [...] He stated {{that he did not}} feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding [...] "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" [...] elements as a result. He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but he just has a bunch of tools on his belt, like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver. I thought that was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / is where I drew some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny,</b> they looked so pretty and clean, it looked like they didn't know what they were singing about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E

500|$|Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, {{authors of}} Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), noted {{the lyrics of}} the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing {{for the return of}} an ex-boyfriend." [...] Spears said [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is a song [...] "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." [...] The lyrics, however, caused {{controversy}} in the United States, because the line [...] "Hit me baby one more time" [...] supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line [...] "doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> that people would actually think that's what it meant." [...] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro deemed the song's lyrics as suggestive, mostly [...] "Oh baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you / Boy, you got me blinded / Oh pretty baby / There's nothing that I wouldn't do" [...] and [...] "When I'm not with you I lose my mind / Give me a sign / Hit me baby one more time".|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, or should I say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the look she gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing. I thought it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?"

500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny,</b> and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny.</b> Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

Colin Egglesfield, Josh's portrayer, when queried by Soap Opera Digest on the matter of possibly holding the record in daytime for the oddest way to be brought into the world, replied, [...] "Yeah, and it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> because when people ask me who I am on the show, I like to say, 'I'm the abortion of Erica Kane.'

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny,</b> because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and we go to a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E
