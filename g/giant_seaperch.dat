40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} properties of two bones of {{two species of}} fish, hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) and <b>giant</b> <b>seaperch</b> (Lates calcarifer Bloch.), were compared with chicken bone to evaluate their composition for use as natural calcium supplement. The information could be useful for waste utilization in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Physical testing {{and chemical}} analyses were performed according to the USP 24 and BP 1998 standards under calcium carbonate monograph. Loss on drying found in hoki, <b>giant</b> <b>seaperch</b> and chicken bones was 12. 4, 11. 3 and 5. 9 % w/w, calculated on dried basis, respectively. Total calcium determined by complexometric titration was 31. 8, 28. 1 and 32. 2 % w/w in hoki, <b>giant</b> <b>seaperch</b> and chicken bones, respectively. All samples contained carbonate and phosphate anion residues but gluconate, acetate and citrate were absent. The presence of calcium carbonate was confirmed by thermogravimetry. Results from all bones showed that limit tests for heavy metals, arsenic and iron complied with the USP standard, whereas barium, chloride and sulfate conformed to the BP standard. The magnesium and alkali metals in <b>giant</b> <b>seaperch</b> bone were within the BP limit (1. 5 %), but those of hoki and chicken bone exceeded the limit...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of 20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca. Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C 18 : 3 n 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3). Longtail shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher (P< 0. 05) amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), respectively. Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red snapper, black pomfret, Japanese threadfin bream, <b>giant</b> <b>seaperch,</b> and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content (537. 2 – 944. 1 [*]mg/ 100 g wet sample) of desirable omega- 3 fatty acids. The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids (P/S) ratios for most samples were higher than that of Menhaden oil (P/S= 0. 58), a recommended PUFA supplement which may help to lower blood pressure. Yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 6. 4, P/S= 1. 7), moonfish (highest ALA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 1. 9, P/S= 1. 0), and longtail shad (highest EPA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 0. 8, P/S= 0. 4) were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition of fatty acids. Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes in the future...|$|E
