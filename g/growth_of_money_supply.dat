However, annual inflation was 8%, 9% and 10% during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s(1990-1995) respectively. The committee did not share the same view on Monetary Targeting as was practiced in countries around the world. It did not believe in setting rigid targets.

This, however, has been excessively criticized as people believed that too much short period fine tuning of the monetary system should be avoided and the emphasis should be on ensuring long term monetary stability.

50|$|Second, both {{stagnation}} {{and inflation}} {{can result from}} inappropriate macroeconomic policies. For example, central banks can cause inflation by allowing excessive <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> and the government can cause stagnation by excessive regulation of goods markets and labour markets. Excessive <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> taken to such an extreme {{that it must be}} reversed abruptly, can be a cause. Both types of explanations are offered in analyses of the global stagflation of the 1970s: it began with a huge rise in oil prices, but then continued as central banks used excessively stimulative monetary policy to counteract the resulting recession, causing a runaway price/wage spiral.|$|R
50|$|This {{period of}} Scottish history also marked the {{profound}} <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> within Scotland. The initial cause <b>of</b> the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> was domestic factors. A silver mining boom in northern England enabled David I to develop Scotland’s first minted coins. The increase in available capital helped fuel commercial development, especially in Scotland and England, which gained {{directly from the}} mines in the Pennines. However, even when the mines were exhausted of silver, the current account surplus enabled the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> to continue growing. “During the thirteenth century, a positive and reciprocal relationship therefore existed between the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> overseas trade, expansion <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supplies,</b> and advance <b>of</b> commercialization,” describes economic historian Bruce Campbell.|$|R

5000|$|The Quantitative Easing by {{the central}} banks with the effect of an {{increased}} money supply in an economy often helps to increase or moderate inflationary targets. There is a puzzle formation between low-rate of inflation and a high <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> When {{the current rate of}} inflation is low, a high worth of money supply warrants the tightening of liquidity and an increased interest rate for a moderate aggregate demand and the avoidance of any potential problems. Further, in case of a low output a tightened monetary policy would affect the production in a much more severe manner.The supply shocks have known to play a dominant role in the regard of monetary policy. The bumper harvest in 1998-99 with a buffer yield in wheat, sugarcane, and pulses had led to an early supply condition further driving their prices from what were they in the last year. The increased import competition since 1991 with the trade liberalization in place have widely contributed to the reduced manufacturing competition with a cheaper agricultural raw materials and the fabric industry. These cost-saving driven technologies have often helped to drive a low-inflation rate. The normal growth cycles accompanied with the international price pressures has several times being characterized by domestic uncertainties.|$|E

The comparison outlines, how deeply individual schools differ. While Keynesians considered the dear money and high interest rates as the main cause of the crisis and similarly to Monetarists, they both suggested keeping them on low level, Austrians promptly refused the policy of low interest rates.
