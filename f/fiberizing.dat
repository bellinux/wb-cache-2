40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{demonstrate}} the energy efficiency and reduced emissions that can be obtained with a dual torch DC plasma transferred arc-melting system. Plasmelt Glass Technologies, LLC was formed to solicit and execute the project, which utilize a full-scale test melter system. The system {{is similar to the}} one that was originally constructed by Johns Manville, but Plasmelt has added significant improvements to the torch design and melter system that has extended the original JM short torch lives. The original JM design has been shown to achieve melt rates 5 to 10 times faster than conventional gas or electric melting, with improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions. This project began on 7 / 28 / 2003 and ended 7 / 27 / 06. A laboratory scale melter was designed, constructed, and operated to conduct multiple experimental melting trials on various glass compositions. Glass quality was assessed. Although the melter design is generic and equally applicable to all sectors within the glass industry, the development of this melter has focused primarily on fiberglass with additional exploratory melting trials of frits, specialty, and minerals-melting applications. Throughput, energy efficiency, and glass quality {{have been shown to be}} heavily dependent on the selected glass composition. During this project, Plasmelt completed the proof-of-concept work in our Boulder, CO Lab to show the technical feasibility of this transferred-arc plasma melter. Late in the project, the work was focused on developing the processes and evaluating the economic viability of plasma melting aimed at the specific glasses of interest to specific client companies. Post project work is on going with client companies to address broader non-glass materials such as refractories and industrial minerals. Exploratory melting trials have been conducted on several glasses of commercial interest including: C-glass, E-glass, S-Glass, AR-Glass, B-glass, Lighting Glass, NE-Glass, and various frits. Exploratory melts of non-glassy materials, such as wollastonite, zirconium silicate, and alumino-silicate melts were successfully done indicating that plasma melting has potential application beyond glass. Experimental results were generated that show the high quality of plasma-melted fiberglass compositions, such as E-glass, can result in good <b>fiberizing</b> performance. <b>Fiberizing</b> performance and tensile strength data were achieved during the project to support this conclusion. High seed counts are a feature of the current lab scale melter and must be dealt with via other means, since fining work was outside the scope of this project...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} culture conditions {{have been evaluated}} concerning the extracellular enzyme activities of the white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora growing on Eucalyptus grandis wood. The consequence of the varied fungal pretreatment on a subsequent chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP) was addressed. In all cultures, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and xylanase were the predominant extracellular enzymes. The biopulping efficiency was evaluated based {{on the amount of}} fiber bundles obtained after the first <b>fiberizing</b> step and the fibrillation levels of refined pulps. It was found that the MnP levels in the cultures correlated positively with the biopulping benefits. On the other hand, xylanase and total oxalate levels did not vary significantly. Accordingly, {{it was not possible to}} determine whether MnP accomplishes the effect alone or depends on synergic action of other extracellular agents. Pulp strength and fiber size distribution were also evaluated. The average fiber length of CTMP pulps prepared from untreated wood chips was 623 mu m. Analogous values were observed for most of the biopulps; however, significant amounts of shorter fibers were found in the biopulp prepared from wood chips biotreated in cultures supplemented with glucose plus corn-steep liquor. Despite evidence of reduced average fiber length, biopulps prepared from these wood chips presented the highest improvement in tensile indexes (+ 28 % at 23 degrees Schopper-Riegler) ...|$|E

40|$|Issue: Fiberglass {{insulation}} manufacturing {{has grown}} {{to be one of}} the largest uses for recycled glass. Because fiberglass does not have glass’s clarity, there is an assumption among some that fiberglass raw materials can tolerate higher levels of contaminants than container manufacturing. In fact, metal, organic, and ceramic contaminants can be costly to fiberglass quality and production equipment. Best Practice: During fiberglass production, raw batch materials and glass cullet are continuously added to the furnace. After melting and “fining, ” the molten glass is spun into fibers by a process called <b>fiberizing.</b> To ensure production of consistent fibers, cullet must meet specifications for major and minor oxide chemical composition, color consistency, and contaminant levels. Major and Minor Oxide Chemical Composition. The chemical composition of cullet as raw batch material for fiberglass should fall within the ranges listed in the table. Variations in major oxide concentration can affect both the viscosity and emissivity of the glass melt. Viscosity is a measure of flow resistance, while emissivity is the ability of a material to emit heat through radiation. Both of these properties affect the attenuation ability of the molten glass during fiber formation. In addition, a shift in a major oxide concentration can cause fluctuations in the electrical resistivity of the melt. This requires an adjustment of transformer settings controlling the power input to the furnace, as well as creating changes in heat flow patterns, current paths, and temperature distribution, all of which are undesirable during stable furnace operations. Minor and trace oxide composition of the batch cullet is also very important. Oxides such as CoO, Cr 2 O, and FeO can influence infrared heat transmission, heat transfer during melting, and rate of fiber cooling. These factors will affect fiber attenuation, leading to variability in the fiber diameters and lengths...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying the in situ fiberization process to the fabrication of strain isolation pads (SIP) for the Space Shuttle {{and to the}} fabrication of graphite-epoxy composites was evaluated. The ISF process involves the formation of interconnected polymer fiber networks by agitation of dilute polymer solutions under controlled conditions. High temperature polymers suitable for SIP use were <b>fiberized</b> and a successful fiberization of polychloro trifluoroethylene, a relatively high melting polymer, was achieved. Attempts to <b>fiberize</b> polymers with greater thermal stability were unsuccessful, apparently due to characteristics caused {{by the presence of}} aromaticity in the backbone of such materials. Graphite-epoxy composites were fabricated by interconnecting two dimensional arrays of graphite fiber with polypropylene IS fibers with subsequent epoxy resin impregnation.

40|$|Recently, {{coherent}} {{control of}} the optical response of thin films in standing waves has attracted considerable attention, ranging from applications in excitation-selective spectroscopy and nonlinear optics to all-optical image processing. Here we show that integration of metamaterial and optical fibre technologies allows the use of coherently controlled absorption in a fully <b>fiberized</b> and packaged switching metadevice. With this metadevice, which controls light with light in a nanoscale plasmonic metamaterial film on an optical fibre tip, we provide proof-of-principle demonstrations of logical functions XOR, NOT and AND that are performed within a coherent fully <b>fiberized</b> network at wavelengths between 1530 and 1565 nm. The metadevice has been tested at up to 40 gigabits per second and sub-milliwatt power levels. Since coherent absorption can operate at the single photon level and with 100 THz bandwidth, we argue that the demonstrated all-optical switch concept has potential applications in coherent and quantum information networks...|$|R

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out reliable laboratory methods to predict the effect of enzymes on specific energy consumption and fiber properties of TMP pulp. The second one was to find with interactive software called “Knowledge discovery in databases” enzymes or other additives that can be used in finding a solution to reduce energy consumption of TMP pulp. The chemical composition of wood and enzymes, which have activity on main wood components were presented in the literature part of the work. The results of previous research in energy reduction of TMP process with enzymes were also highlighted. The main principles of knowledge discovery have been included in literature part too. The experimental part of the work contains the methods description in which the standard size chip, crushed chip and <b>fiberized</b> spruce chip (<b>fiberized</b> pulp) were used. Different types of enzymatic treatment with different dosages and time were tested during the experiments and showed. Pectinase, endoglucanase and mixture of enzymes were used for evaluation of method reliability. The fines content and fiber length of pulp was measured and used as evidence of enzymes' effect. The refining method with “Bauer” laboratory disc refiner was evaluated as not highly reliable. It was not able to provide high repeatability of results, because of uncontrolled feeding capacity and refining consistency. The refining method with Valley refiner did not have a lot of variables and showed stable and repeatable results in energy saving. The results of experiments showed that efficient enzymes impregnation is probably the main target with enzymes application for energy saving. During the work the <b>fiberized</b> pulp showed high accessibility to enzymatic treatment and liquid penetration without special impregnating equipment. The reason was that <b>fiberized</b> pulp has larger wood surface area and thereby the contact area between the enzymatic solution and wood is also larger. Standard size chip and crushed chip treatment without special impregnator of enzymatic solution was evaluated as not efficient and did not show visible, repeatable results in energy consumption decrease. Thereby it was concluded that using of <b>fiberized</b> pulp and Valley refiner for measurements of enzymes' effectiveness in SEC decrease is more suitable than normal size chip and crushed chip with “Bauer” refiner. Endoglucanase with 5 kg/t dosage showed about 20 % energy consumption decrease. Mixture of enzymes with 1. 5 kg/t dosage showed about 15 % decrease of energy consumption during the refining. Pectinase at different dosages and treatment times did not show significant effect on energy consumption. Results of knowledge discovery in databases showed the xylanase, cellulase and pectinase blend as most promising for energy reduction in TMP process.

40|$|Laser {{generation}} of ultrasound {{and the subsequent}} detection of the ultrasonic waves using laser interferometry are areas of active research [1 – 6]. In earlier papers, the present authors have discussed an LBU system which employs a diffraction grating for illumination of a line-array to generate narrow-band surface waves and Lamb waves [4], and a <b>fiberized</b> heterodyne dual-probe laser interferometer to measure signals [3]. This paper reports progress towards {{the development of a}} robust low cost <b>fiberized</b> Sagnac laser interferometer suitable for field applications. Bowers first reported [7] the use of a Sagnac-type interferometer for surface acoustic wave detection, and the present authors have previously reported [8 QNDE 95] a variant of that scheme. In this paper, we present an alternative lower noise system that uses low cost, long coherence He-Ne lasers that have better intensity noise characteristics than typically used laser diodes. A scheme for elimination of a parasitic interference utilizing a frequency shifting technique has been developed. The primary advantage of the Sagnac interferometer is that it is exactly path matched and as such requires no heterodyning or static path compensation for sensor stabilization. The Sagnac interferometer described below is suitable for the measurement of ultrasonic surface waves arising from laser- or PZT-generated sources or from acoustic emissions.
