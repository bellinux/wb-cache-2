5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of <b>functional</b> <b>analysis</b> began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E

5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of <b>functional</b> <b>analysis</b> have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of <b>functional</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used instead.|$|E
5|$|John von Neumann's work on <b>functional</b> <b>analysis</b> and {{topology}} in broke {{new ground}} {{in mathematics and}} economic theory. It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus. In particular, general equilibrium theorists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than differential calculus, because the approach of differential calculus had failed to establish {{the existence of an}} equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|<b>Functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> {{provides}} an inherently nonparametric approach {{for the analysis}} of data which consist of samples of time courses or random trajectories. It is a relatively young field aiming at modeling and data exploration under very flexible model assumptions with no or few parametric components. Basic tools of <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> are smoothing, <b>functional</b> principal components, functional linear models and time-warping. Warping or curve registration aims at adjusting for random time distortions. While in the usual <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> paradigm the sample functions were considered as continuously observed, in longitudinal data analysis one mostly deals with sparsely and irregularly observed data that also are corrupted with noise. Adjustments of <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> techniques which take these particular features into account are needed to use them to advantage for longitudinal data. We review some techniques that have been recently proposed to connect <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> methodology with longitudinal data. The extension of <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> towards longitudinal data is a fairly recent undertaking that presents a promising avenue for future research.

Brachychirotherium has been found from Rio Grande do Sul in Paleorrota, Brazil as well as Italy, Germany, and the eastern United States. They are also common in the southwestern United States, having been found from Canyonlands National Park and Dinosaur National Monument. Many of these tracks have a narrow gauge (meaning left and right prints are placed closely together) and nearly overstep each other.

5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for <b>functional</b> <b>analysis.</b> Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial <b>functional</b> <b>analysis</b> of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E

40|$|In most situations, modern {{technological}} developments {{give rise to}} the cases where samples are drawn from a population of real random functions. <b>Functional</b> Data <b>Analysis</b> (FDA) is an appropriate multivariate statistical approximation since the classical multivariate methods {{can not be used}} when a random sample consists of such n-real functions. Generally the functions are sampled discretely in time and a certain smoothing technique is used to obtain underlying functions. In this study we first give a detailed theory of B-Splines and then obtain cubic splines as linear combinations based on the coefficients resulted from an implementation of the Roughness Penalty Method. We then present a comprehensive theoretical background of the <b>functional</b> data <b>analysis</b> with a special attention given to the functional and regularized functional principal components concepts that are very useful to explore and interpret the variability of the functions and also their derivatives especially when one has a large number of functions. Finally, an application of the regularized functional principal components on the weekly closing share prices data of the thirteen companies belonging to the ISE- 100 index is presented.
