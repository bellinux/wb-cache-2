Generally, at lower temperatures, the impact energy of a material is decreased. The size of the specimen may also affect the value of the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> because it may allow a different number of imperfections in the material, which can act as stress risers and lower the impact energy.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test,</b> and the instrumented drop weight plate <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> (IDWPIT).
