40|$|A {{variable}} air-volume, parallel-plate, extrapolation chamber {{forming an}} integral part of a Solid-WaterTM phantom was built to determine the absorbed dose in Solid-WaterTM directly. The sensitive air-volume of the extrapolation chamber is controlled through the movement of the chamber piston by means of a micrometer mounted to the phantom body. The relative displacement of the piston is monitored by a mechanical <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> <b>indicator</b> with a precision on the order of 0. 002 mm. Irradiations were carried out with cobalt- 60 gamma. rays, x-ray beams ranging from 4 to 18 MV, and electron beams between 6 and 22 MeV. The absorbed dose at a given depth in Solid-WaterTM is proportional to the ionization gradient measured in the Bragg-Gray cavity region with a Solid-WaterTM embedded extrapolation chamber. Measured charge is corrected for ion recombination and ion diffusion in the chamber air volume according to a comprehensive model for charge loss in an ionization chamber. The discrepancies between doses determined with our uncalibrated phantom-embedded extrapolation chamber and doses obtained with calibrated Farmer-type cylindrical ionization chambers following the AAPM-TG 21 and AAPM-TG 25 dosimetry protocols are less than 1 % for photon and electron beams at all clinical megavoltage energies. Uncalibrated extrapolation chambers thus offer a simple and practical alternative to other techniques used in output measurements of megavoltage photon and electron beams...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that time series {{analyses}} of road safety and risk can be improved by using demographic data. We demonstrate that the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by drivers or riders of a certain age reflects the fluctuations over the years of the number of people of that age within the population. We further demonstrate that the change over time of per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> i. e. <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> per person, is often less subject to stochastic fluctuations, and therefore more smooth than the total <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for drivers of that age. This smoothness is used to obtain forecasts of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> or to average out year-to-year fluctuations of data of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b> Analysis of such data stratified by age group, gender or both reveals that, for most travel modes, per capita <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> is to a large extent constant or slowly changing over time. The consequences for the evaluation of risk, i. e. casualties per <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> with and without the use of population data, are explored. Dutch data are used to illustrate the model concept. It is shown that the analyses and forecasts of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> could gain substantially by incorporating demographic data, as compared to an analysis with data of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> alone. The paper further shows that, for an analysis of risk and therefore for traffic safety forecasts in the absence of any data of <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> stratified analysis of mortality, i. e. casualties per inhabitant, may be a reasonable alternative.

40|$|Abstract Background {{currently}} road {{accidents are}} mostly monitored through mortality and injury rates. This paper reports the methodology {{and the results}} of a project set forth by the European Union (EU) and coordinated by the WHO aimed at identifying and evaluating a core set of indicators to monitor the causal chain of road accident health effects. The project is part of the ECOEHIS (Development of Environment and Health Indicators for European Union Countries). Methods a group of experts (WG), identified 14 indicators after a review of the information collected at the EU level, each of them representing a specific aspect of the DPSEEA (Driving, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect, Action) model applied and adapted to the road accidents. Each indicator was scored according to a list of 16 criteria chosen by the WG. Those found to have a high score were analysed to determine if they were compatible with EU legislation and then tested in the feasibility study. Results 11 of the 14 indicators found to be relevant and compatible with the criteria of selection were proposed for the feasibility study. Mortality, injury, road accident rate, age of vehicle fleet, and <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> are the <b>indicators</b> recommended for immediate implementation. Conclusion after overcoming the limitations that emerged (absence of a common definition of death by road accident and injury severity, underestimation of injuries, differences in information quality) this core set of indicators will allow Member States to carry out effective internal/external comparisons over time. </p...|$|R

All light-duty vehicles were included in the analysis. The results indicate that during the 40 -year period examined, vehicle <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> increased by 155 %. However, because vehicle load decreased by 27 %, occupant <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> increased by only 84 %. Vehicle fuel economy (of the entire fleet of light-duty vehicles) improved by 40 %. However, because of the decrease in vehicle load, occupant fuel economy improved by only 17 %. As a consequence of the changes in vehicle fuel economy, vehicle <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> and vehicle load, the total amount of fuel used increased by 53 %. Also included in the report is a brief discussion of the effects of potential future changes in vehicle fuel economy, vehicle <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> and vehicle load on the amount of fuel used.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> is a {{critical}} component of American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million long distance domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban <b>travel,</b> long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> at interregional level given existing data resources? This research elaborates the methodologies for the framework design and addresses the technical and theoretical challenges particularly in issues of travel impedance estimation and long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> network loading. Findings from this research lay a solid foundation for building the fundamental theoretical framework urgently needed for long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> studies and contribute significantly to the understanding of the supply side of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> from available infrastructure capacity and networks loading conditions to the induced environment challenges, infrastructure congestion, and investment costs, as well as facilitating policy making and evaluation pertain to long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> at national level...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to characterize propulsion and control surface (caudal fin) of Anabas testudineus (puyu) based on <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> resultant speed and acceleration. Fish was trained to swim along a 2 x 1 feet long aquarium. Two fish (adult and juvenile) were kept in the aquarium at a time to stimulate a competitive situation and induce burst swimming sequences. Spontaneous swimming along the aquarium was filmed and analysed. A CCV-A 11 b (Progressive Scan Monochrome Camera) was positioned 180 cm above the base of the aquarium to provide dorsal views of swimming sequences. Images from video recordings (20 frames sÂ¯Â¹) were analysed frame by frame using global coordinates system, with time interval 0. 05 s. When sub-carangiform alone was used it was found that in both juvenile and adult, the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by the tail tip was always greater than the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by the body. In contrast, when sub-carangiform was used in combination with labriform locomotion, the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by tail tip was less than the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by the body, which is comparable to the double propulsion system found in marine vehicles. Apart from that, other findings revealed that juvenile fish had higher acceleration rate compared to an adult for a given time. Overall, A. testudineus were more efficient swimmers in their juvenile forms than in adulthood based on their <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> speed, acceleration and <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> ratio...|$|R

40|$|The Ohio Statewide Travel Demand Model is a {{state-of-the-art}} economic, {{land use and}} transport model. The person transport component of this model is a tour-based, micro-simulation model of {{the entire population of}} the State of Ohio. A special feature of the person transport models is the inclusion of a long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model designed to capture the unique behavior associated with individual’s trips longer than 50 miles. This paper will focus on the calibration and application of the long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model. The Ohio long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model includes six primary components: binary choice of travel, pattern choice, scheduling, internal-external choice, destination choice, and mode choice. In application, each of these choices is simulated for the same synthetic population used by the short <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model. Both short and long distance trips are assigned to the same networks, competing for transportation capacity. Previous work (1) described the design and estimation of the long distance model in further detail. This paper will describe the calibration of each of the long distance model. It compares the model’s performance to observed data, primarily from the 2002 - 2003 Ohio Long <b>Distance</b> <b>Travel</b> Survey. It includes discussion of changes to model parameters and model structure made as part of the calibration process. This paper seeks to provide several benefits to future practitioners. First, by reporting the model calibration targets it illustrates the magnitude and characteristics of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> This information is not as readily available as information about short <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> and provides context to those considering which model components to prioritize when investing limited resources. Second, the paper compares the performance of an innovative new approach to modeling long <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> allowing future model developers to build upon the work with full knowledge of their starting point...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} the <b>distances</b> <b>travelled</b> for inpatient treatment in England across different population groups {{prior to the}} introduction of policy to extend patient choice focusing particularly on differences by socio-economic status of patient. Methods: Using HES data for 2003 / 04 the distance from the admitted patient’s residence to the NHS site of treatment was calculated for each admission. Distances were summed to electoral ward level to give the distribution of <b>distances</b> <b>travelled</b> at ward level. These were analysed to show the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for different admission types, ages of patient, rural/urban location, and the socio-economic deprivation {{of the population of the}} ward. Results: There is considerable variation in the <b>distances</b> <b>travelled</b> for hospital treatment between electoral wards. Some of this is explained by geographical location. Individuals located in wards in more rural areas travel further for elective, emergency and maternity admissions. But individuals located in highly deprived wards travel less far and this shorter distance is not explained just by the closer location of facilities to these wards. Conclusions: Before the patient choice reforms were implemented, there were considerable differences between individuals in the <b>distances</b> they <b>travel</b> for hospital care. As patient choice is being actively rolled-out the factors that result in people in more deprived areas travelling less need to be better understood. hospital care, <b>distance</b> <b>travelled,</b> socio-economic inequality...|$|R
