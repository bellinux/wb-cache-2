5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes a position on the <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police.

One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

25|$|By {{the twelfth}} and early thirteenth centuries, {{there was a}} shift away from the accusatorial model toward the legal {{procedure}} used in the Roman Empire.

25|$|Judge Dee, naturally, is {{responsible}} for deciding sentences as well as assessing <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> innocence, although van Gulik notes in the stories that all capital punishments must be referred to and decided by officials in the capital.

50|$|In {{cultural}} anthropology, a <b>guilt</b> society, <b>or</b> <b>guilt</b> culture, is {{the concept}} of a society in which the primary method of social control is the inculcation of feelings of guilt for behaviors that the individual believes to be undesirable. It is possible to classify societies, specifically apollonian ones, according to the emotions they use to control individuals, swaying them into norm obedience and conformity. According to this classification, a guilt culture is an alternative to a shame culture. Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts of pride and honour, and appearances are what counts, as opposed to individual conscience in guilt cultures. The distinction was first coined by E. R. Dodds in The Greeks and the Irrational (1951).|$|R
