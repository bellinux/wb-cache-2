50|$|Holcroft was of {{the opinion}} that the {{original}} <b>inside</b> and outside <b>frames</b> were modified whereas Le Fleming {{was of the}} opinion that new <b>inside</b> <b>frames</b> would have been required. However, as the modification also increased the coupled wheelbase from 7 ft 4 in to 8 ft 6 in it is unlikely that much of the original framing was re-used.|$|R

5000|$|Joy and Fenton {{settled on}} a medium sized boiler, 800 sq ft heated surface area, with a {{pressure}} of [...] and concentrated on its steaming abilities. In this, James Fenton had particular expertise. The engine had 15 x 20 in inside cylinders and 6 ft driving wheels. Gray's so-called 'mixed' frame had an <b>inside</b> <b>frame</b> for the cylinders and driving wheels, with inside bearings, and an outside frame for the 4 ft leading and trailing wheels, using outside bearings. The <b>inside</b> <b>frame</b> stopped at the firebox, so that the latter was {{as wide as the}} wheels would allow. By this means he minimized the overhang at each end.|$|E

But eyewitness accounts indicate they were not completely successful.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had an <b>inside</b> <b>frame</b> and {{the boiler}} had three shells, the rear one being crowned by the steam dome. The outer firebox had a Belpaire cover, a deep firebox that extended below the axles {{and a large}} smokebox.|$|E

50|$|The GWR 633 Class were 0-6-0 tank {{locomotives}} {{designed by}} George Armstrong and {{built at the}} Wolverhampton railway works of the Great Western Railway in 1871-2. Unusually, they had side (not saddle) tanks, and <b>inside</b> <b>frames,</b> with wheels of 4 ft in diameter and a wheelbase of 15 ft. The weight was 34 tons 12 cwt. There were twelve locomotives, numbered 633-644.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} is externally {{very similar}} to the other Mallet engines, only the driver's cab is noticeably different, and all axles are mounted in <b>inside</b> <b>frames</b> (the older engines have an outside frame for the rear two axles). The loco is in working order and is generally used by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways on the Selke Valley Railway in charge of scheduled trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had an <b>inside</b> <b>frame</b> {{which was}} built as a water tank. The boiler comprised two shell rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward shell ring. The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel spark arrestor. Later a Prüsmann chimney was used.|$|E
50|$|The rear set {{of drivers}} with their {{high-pressure}} cylinders is fixed in the plate {{frame of the}} loco. The front set of drivers with their low-pressure cylinders {{are linked to the}} rear sets with king pins, the rivetted boiler lies on it with its slide plates (Gleitplatten) Leaf springs at the sides hold the driving gear in a central position. Both driving sets have an <b>inside</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To make {{a smooth}} {{transition}} from door (or window frame) to tin can wall with plaster, sheets of metal lath {{are attached to the}} rim of the frame and folded over the gap between the frame and the can wall. A double-layered wooden frame is therefore required, to give a surface for the metal lath to be nailed to while leaving the <b>inside</b> <b>frame</b> untouched. However, this is not necessarily a necessity.|$|E

50|$|Locomotives Nos. 34 and 35 were {{a pair of}} Great Western Railway 0-6-0 steam {{locomotives}} {{built at}} Wolverhampton railway works under George Armstrong in 1866 as reconstructions of old Shrewsbury and Chester Railway engines bearing the same numbers. The originals had been 0-4-0s with intermediate axles, and the reconstructions were unique among GWR 0-6-0 tender engines in having <b>inside</b> <b>frames</b> and being of the long boiler type. Both spent {{their lives in the}} Chester area.|$|R
50|$|These engines had <b>inside</b> <b>frames</b> and Allan {{valve gear}} and were {{delivered}} in three series, that differed {{from one another}} in their dimensions. The original classification D {{was adopted by the}} Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn) and amended to D IV. Initially all the engines were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. However, only six vehicles were given running numbers (88 7021-7026). By the late 1920s they were all either retired or sold.|$|R
