500|$|Disagreements between female rapper Remy Ma and Minaj {{originated}} in 2007, when Remy {{took note of}} Minaj's freestyle record, nicknamed [...] "Dirty Money", from her mixtape Playtime Is Over (2007). In the record, Minaj recites: [...] "Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown/she won three rounds, I'ma need a hundred thou/like 'Chinatown' — bitches better bow down/oh you ain't know, betcha bitches know now/fuck I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> — {{let her know that}} I'm the one". When the two encountered each other at an industry party, Remy asked Minaj who she was dissing in the song. Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day I still feel like [...] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added that she would be [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales." [...] Ma's opinion of Minaj not being a [...] "nice person" [...] and past incidents with Mariah Carey, Taylor Swift, and Lil' Kim were also factors in [...] "Shether"'s release.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank {{statements}} and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico. Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey. During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this {{did not include a}} gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico. Afterwards, Selena again met with Saldívar in her hotel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi. At the hotel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> from her purse and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing an artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a -long trail of blood. She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a [...] "bitch". Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was, however, spotted by a responding police cruiser. She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI. By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E

The camera panned away just before the camera panned back and three more gunshots were heard. The police officer sitting on Sterling's chest {{was not in the}} picture and the other officer who drew the gun, was about [...] away. His gun was pointed on Sterling, who had a gunshot wound in his chest. The officers retrieved a loaded [...]38 caliber revolver from Sterling's front pants pocket. The officers then radioed for Emergency Medical Services.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the train}} {{approached}} the Merillon Avenue station, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the ground, stood up, {{and opened fire}} at random. During the next three minutes, Ferguson killed six people and injured another 19. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun!</b> He's shooting people!" [...] Ferguson walked east on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to {{the eastern end of}} the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. The New York Times later wrote the motions were [...] "as methodical as if he were taking tickets". Ferguson said, [...] "I'm going to get you," [...] over and over as he walked down the aisle.|$|E

He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good <b>gun,</b> and all the {{cartridges}} he'll be likely to want; and the cartridges are all like this. They're a new kind I heard of last winter, and I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> case from Boston last week. I don't see how I ever managed to run my camps without them. Do you see that shot?" [...] said he, opening one end of a cartridge. [...] "Well, take one in your hand and pinch it." ...|$|R

Slater, McDaniel, Tommy Rich, and André the Giant were at a bar in Tampa when someone in the bar made a comment about Rich's wife, which angered Rich and McDaniel. The man who had commented about Rich's wife <b>got</b> <b>a</b> knife, and seeing that, McDaniel <b>got</b> out <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> André and Slater {{went out to the}} parking lot and watched the altercation; while they were watching McDaniel pistol-whip the man, the gun went off and Slater was hit by the bullet in the leg. Slater told the police that a sniper had shot him; he would return to the ring in just three weeks. Slater was also famous for an altercation in a bar in Tampa, Florida with John Matuszak, which Slater won.|$|R

He left Death Row in early 2004 to start his own label, Dynasty Entertainment. It was not long after that when Crooked I signed a distribution deal with Treacherous Records/Universal, but more legal trouble from Death Row surfaced, and Crooked I had to stop production for his then titled debut album, Mama's Boy, which was actually going to be the name of Crooked's second release under Death Row Records.

60|$|Overstrained {{etiquette}} at last gave way. It is {{not known}} who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio; but the consequences were immediate. Buck Malone, of the Mulberry Hills, with <b>a</b> Dewey-like swiftness, <b>got</b> <b>an</b> eight-inch <b>gun</b> swung round from his hurricane deck. But McManus's simile must be the torpedo. He glided in under the <b>guns</b> and slipped <b>a</b> scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the Mulberry Hill cruiser. Meanwhile Brick Cleary, a devotee to strategy, had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics, leaving the combat to be waged {{by the light of}} gunfire alone. Dutch Mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a Shakespeare to immortalize the Cimmerian shindy.|$|R

And Pome-Lee waited--waited till the sun was well overhead and they sat at meat, when he gave the cry and we fell upon them. Never was there such a fight, and never such fighters. Half did we kill in the quickness of surprise, but the half that was left became as devils, and they multiplied themselves, and everywhere they fought like devils. Three put their backs against the mast of the ship, and we ringed them with our dead before they died. And some got guns and shot with both eyes wide open, and very quick and sure. And one <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big <b>gun,</b> from which at one time he shot many small bullets. And so, behold!" ...|$|R
