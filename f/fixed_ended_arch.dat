Nonlinearities due to both the change of geometry and material yielding are included, incorporataing also the effects of strain-unloading. The geometry and the stiffness of the elements are modified and used to update the structure tangent stiffness matrix. An iterative procedure combining the arc-length and the work methods is employed for {{the solution of the}} incremental equation of equilibrium. The method has been applied successfully to predict the nonlinear load-deflection behavior of isolated cold-formed SHS columns, fabricated RHS parabolic <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> <b>arches,</b> and double chord SHS trusses having different joint configurations...|$|R

By taking the effect of shear {{on the behavior of}} beam elements into consideration, a set of modified homogeneous solution of the beam elastic curve equation was obtained and used to derive expressions for <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> moments and shears for beams with various end conditions and loading. The shear-modified <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> moment expressions were used to analyze redundant frames.

40|$|Abstract. The {{failure of}} the {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) column {{on the ground floor}} may result in progressive collapse of the whole building. In the paper, the finite element program LS-DYNA is used to simulate the dynamic response of RC column with different constraints subjected to blast pressure. A three dimensional solid model is established for the RC column. A brittle damage model is applied to simulate the concrete. The lateral displacement and failure mode of RC column with different scaled distances are investigated and discussed. It can be found that the pressure nephogram and x-direction displacement of <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> column under different scaled distance have the obvious symmetry. Moreover, both the maximum pressure and x-direction displacement of one <b>end</b> <b>fixed</b> and one <b>end</b> simply supported column are bigger than <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> column with the same scaled distance...|$|R

The functional principle {{is based on an}} elastically bendable cantilever with one <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> and the target mounted at the free end. The deflection of the cantilever is measured with an interferometric displacement sensor. Between the free and the <b>fixed</b> <b>ends,</b> two mirrors are attached that reflect the laser light from the sensor optics. By means of this arrangement, the displacement can be recorded in two dimensions, i.e. in the plane perpendicular to the cantilever beam.|$|R
