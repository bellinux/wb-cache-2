Asked what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> tobacco industry lawyers being involved in selecting scientists for research projects, he said that research should be judged on quality, not on who paid for it, adding that he had not personally profited from the funds. According to the UK newspaper The Independent, Eysenck received more than £800k in this way. Eysenck conducted many empirical investigations elucidating the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease.|$|E
25|$|While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a {{long and}} {{critical}} letter titled De Profundis, describing exactly what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but {{which may or may}} not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until it was referenced in a biography of Wilde's that Ross consulted on. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at Rouen, but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.|$|E

500|$|Steinbock's {{relevance}} also lies in {{his background}} and profession, illustrating Balzac's {{conception of the}} Polish people, as well as himself. Having {{spent more than a}} decade befriending Mme. Hanska and visiting her family in Poland, Balzac believed he had insight into the national character (as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> most groups he observed). Thus, descriptions of Steinbock are often laced with commentary about the Polish people: [...] "Soyez mon amie, dit-il avec une de ces démonstrations caressantes si familières aux Polonais, et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilité." [...] ("'Be my sweetheart,' he added, with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of servility.") ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{crossover}} with The Simpsons {{was first}} suggested while the thirteenth season of Family Guy was being planned out. Executive producer Richard Appel received Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from Simpsons executive producers Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on The Simpsons for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria guest star as their Simpsons characters, but Harry Shearer, the final main cast member of The Simpsons, was unavailable. Asked how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the crossover, Shearer replied, [...] "Matter and anti-matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{scholarly}} {{achievements and}} the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: [...] "My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, you know, this man has been knocked out.

She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could never have left him." [...] She claimed to not know how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> her and that they [...] "just passed twenty-seven years [...] together in what was to me absolute bliss." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes {{it seem as if}} they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings not just for the ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed.|$|E

[...] "SOS" [...] contains a sample of [...] "Tainted Love", written by Ed Cobb in 1964, and popularized by English synthpop duo Soft Cell in 1981. In an interview with HitQuarters, Rotem explained the song's conception, saying [...] "I heard 'Tainted Love' and {{wanted to take the}} bass line and update it with a new swing. When I gave the track to Evan , the 80s feeling was already in the track." [...] Rotem was asked how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> working with singers who became successful international recording artists after he had worked with them in an interview with William E.

500|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios {{to record}} a demo tape and {{subsequently}} secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, What is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to concentrate on What is This? Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would suffer musically without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons' and Slovak's places, respectively. [...] During the recording of the second What is This? album, Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as the group was dissatisfied with Slovak's replacement, Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Sherman's guitar work [...] "didn't have the same spirit" [...] that Slovak contributed to the band's sound. [...] When Flea asked Kiedis how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> Slovak rejoining the band, Kiedis responded by saying [...] "I'd give my firstborn son {{to get him back}} in the band." [...] After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.|$|E

The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes, but would later be cut down to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of Hawaiian Nights and Beau Geste was playing, and after the first feature {{it was announced that}} the theater would be screening a preview; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title appeared on the screen the audience cheered, and after it had finished it received a standing ovation. In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started [...] "was the greatest moment of [...] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings", with Selznick describing the preview cards as [...] "probably the most amazing any picture has ever had." [...] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the film, he said: [...] "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative.
