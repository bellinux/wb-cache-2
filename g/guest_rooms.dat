5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed, and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of <b>guest</b> <b>rooms,</b> rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E
5|$|The Beverly Hills Hotel, {{also called}} The Beverly Hills Hotel and Bungalows, {{is located on}} Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California. One of the world's best-known hotels, it is closely {{associated}} with Hollywood film stars, rock stars and celebrities. The hotel has 208 <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> and suites, and 23 bungalows, each designed in the peachy pink and green colors which are a trademark of the hotel.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hotel was finished in redwood with flagstone flooring. The public space included a registration area, a casino, two bars, a coffee shop, a restaurant, various commercial shops and services, and a broadcasting station for K-RAM radio. <b>Guest</b> <b>rooms</b> were located in wings situated behind the main building, surrounding the figure-eight swimming pool. The hotel originally had 300 rooms, each outfitted with air conditioning with individual thermostats.|$|E

50|$|MICROS {{also offers}} {{several types of}} {{interfaces}} which allow the communication between other software. These interfaces include IFC8 interfaces that communicate using Serial or TCP connections that allow the OPERA PMS (property management system) to communicate with their own MICROS POS and other 3rd party vendor systems. The 3rd party vendor systems include <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> phones, <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> voicemail, <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> mini bars, and more. All systems are connected {{to each other in}} order to communicate data and keep a property functioning efficiently. For example, the IFC8 interface that connects the MICROS POS to the OPERA PMS allows for all items sold at the POS to also be recorded on revenue reports of the OPERA PMS. This interface is also what allows a guest to charge their restaurant bill to their <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> bill.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, {{the hotel}} was bought by Westroc Hotels & Resorts and {{underwent}} a renovation, which was completed in 2005. Conceived anew by the architectural firm Allen+Philp, a seven-story tower with <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> and condominiums was built above the lobby, {{in the spirit of}} Varney's proposal. New restaurants were incorporated, including a retro-chic seasonal-American restaurant (ZuZu), and a Trader Vic's franchise at the northeast end of the property (closed in 2011). The hotel's original jet-age design was restored as much as possible, augmented with 2000s-era fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The 200 <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> of the {{original}} hotel were divided into four two-story motel wings, each with fifty rooms, and named after famous race tracks. They were set out in a hacienda style, and surrounded by a half-moon shaped pool. The suites were luxuriously designed. Plush blue carpets and ivory colored chairs with white ceilings were the norm in the early days. An electric tram service, often attended by pretty showgirls, took the guests to their rooms. A 14-story tower commenced construction in late 1965, and was opened in 1967. It existed until November 1996 when it was demolished.|$|E
5|$|Watson's {{hotel was}} {{designed}} by the civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who was also associated witah the St Pancras Station in London. The building was fabricated in England from cast iron components and was assembled and constructed on site. The external cast-iron frame closely resembles other high-profile 19th century buildings such as London's Crystal Palace. The main façade of the hotel is distinguished by building wide open balconies on each floor that connected the <b>guest</b> <b>rooms,</b> which were built around the atrium in a courtyard arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and <b>guest</b> <b>rooms.</b> The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|The Valley Ho competed {{favorably with}} the Safari Hotel, erected {{about the same}} time east of Scottsdale Fashion Square. Both hotels offered premium hospitality, and helped Scottsdale expand its public image. With the Valley Ho an {{immediate}} financial success, in 1958 Varney designed and built two more wings of <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> to the northwest of the original complex. The same materials and style were employed on the expansion buildings, but instead of single exterior corridors with rooms to one side, the added wings loaded central corridors with rooms on both sides. Another Scottsdale landmark hotel, the Mountain Shadows Resort, opened the following year, in 1959. These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic feel on Scottsdale.|$|E
5|$|The {{prison was}} closed in 1996 {{and the site}} reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison {{buildings}} have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying {{a large part of}} the former prison blocks, with cells converted as <b>guest</b> <b>rooms.</b> However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests. The mixed-use heritage project, officially opened on 5 May 2006, won the RICS Project of the Year Award 2007.|$|E

5|$|Woodlea's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house {{is said to}} have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is a full-blown expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture– the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and of a size larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the rest of the house, this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring a steady flow of visitors and a source of profit to the church. Though never the tallest building in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest hotel on the Pacific Coast for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten <b>guest</b> <b>rooms,</b> a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
