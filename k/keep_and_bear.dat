The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E

Andrews v. State (1870) and Glasscock v. Chattanooga (1928) defined the meaning of regulating arms. [...] "Going armed", carrying any sort of weapon for offense or defense in public, is a crime, except carrying a handgun for defense is allowed with a state-issued permit.|$|R
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms. The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|We study a drop-shipping {{supply chain}} {{in which the}} {{retailer}} receives a customer's order and the supplier fills it. In such a chain, the supplier <b>keeps</b> inventory <b>and</b> <b>bears</b> inventory risks; the retailer focuses on marketing and customer acquisition, and forwards the orders to the supplier. The retailer usually has better customer demand information, and may send an over-estimated demand forecast to maximize her own interest, which may result in overstock for the supplier. On the other hand, since the retailer does not own inventory, the main concern of the retailer is that the acquired orders may not be fulfilled because of the supplier's shortage of stock. To cope with these challenges, we propose a menu of commitment-penalty contracts that can provide greater certainty of demand as well as greater certainty of supply. We focus our study in the asymmetric demand information case and we show that the supplier can obtain the retailer's demand information by offering a menu of commitment-penalty contracts. Under this mechanism, we find the solution that maximizes the supplier's expected profit. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms.

In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v.

The film starts from the premise {{that there are more}} tigers in private hands in the United States than there are roaming wild in the world. And, that it is legal in half of the United States to keep a tiger or other big cat. The Tiger Next Door follows {{the story of a man}} named Dennis Hill who has been keeping and breeding tigers from his backyard in Flat Rock, Indiana for over 15 years. When the film begins, Hill has recently lost his federal USDA license to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> breed tigers, <b>bears</b> <b>and</b> cougars and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is threatening to shut him down citing dangerous and inhumane conditions. Hill has five days remaining to upgrade his facilities and place all but three of his 24 tigers, three <b>bears,</b> six leopards <b>and</b> one cougar in alternate homes—before the Indiana DNR will consider issuing licenses for the remaining three animals.|$|R

Additionally, we test the return di erences between the rst (last) six months and the remaining months of bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> market states. These tests reveal evidence that returns are greater (smaller) in the rst (last) six months than the remaining for all bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets, except Norwegian bear markets.
