25|$|LR(k) grammars (also {{known as}} <b>deterministic</b> {{context-free}} grammars) allow parsing (string recognition) with <b>deterministic</b> pushdown automata (PDA), {{but they can}} only describe <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages.|$|E
25|$|In automata theory, a <b>deterministic</b> pushdown {{automaton}} (DPDA or DPA) is {{a variation}} of the pushdown automaton. The class of <b>deterministic</b> pushdown automata accepts the <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages, a proper subset of context-free languages.|$|E
25|$|Closure {{properties}} of <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages (accepted by <b>deterministic</b> PDA by final state) are drastically {{different from the}} context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under complementation, but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a <b>deterministic</b> PDA is also accepted by a <b>deterministic</b> PDA is tricky. In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterministic</b> {{context-free}} languages can {{be recognized}} by a <b>deterministic</b> Turing machine in polynomial time and O(log2 n) space; as a corollary, DCFL is {{a subset of the}} complexity class SC. The set of <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages is not closed under union but is closed under complement.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mathematical}} {{models of}} physical systems are <b>deterministic.</b> This {{is true of}} most models involving differential equations (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not <b>deterministic</b> because they involve randomness are called stochastic. Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some <b>deterministic</b> models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a <b>deterministic</b> interpretation of the model may not be useful due to numerical instability and a finite amount of precision in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by <b>deterministic</b> equations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterministic</b> pushdown automata can {{recognize}} all <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages while nondeterministic ones {{can recognize}} all context-free languages, {{with the former}} often used in parser design.|$|E
25|$|Various social {{behavioural}} traits {{have been}} {{correlated with the}} belief in <b>deterministic</b> models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and <b>deterministic</b> perspectives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterministic</b> {{algorithms}} do not erroneously report composite {{numbers as}} prime. In practice, the fastest such method {{is known as}} elliptic curve primality proving. Analyzing its run time is based on heuristic arguments, {{as opposed to the}} rigorously proven complexity of the more recent AKS primality test. <b>Deterministic</b> methods are typically slower than probabilistic ones, so the latter ones are typically applied first before a more time-consuming <b>deterministic</b> routine is employed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterministic</b> models always {{evolve in}} the same way from a given {{starting}} point. They represent the average, expected behavior of a system, but lack random variation. Many system dynamics models are <b>deterministic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A further {{distinction}} is between <b>deterministic</b> (DFA) and non-deterministic (NFA, GNFA) automata. In a <b>deterministic</b> automaton, every state has exactly one transition for each possible input. In a non-deterministic automaton, an input {{can lead to}} one, more than one, or no transition for a given state. The powerset construction algorithm can transform any nondeterministic automaton into a (usually more complex) <b>deterministic</b> automaton with identical functionality.|$|E
25|$|Early {{scientific}} thought often {{portrayed the}} universe as <b>deterministic</b> – for example in the thought of Democritus or the Cārvākans – and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient information {{would allow them to}} predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of <b>deterministic</b> and stochastic theories. Quantum mechanics predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is <b>deterministic</b> at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely <b>deterministic.</b> Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential Theory of Everything, and open to many different interpretations.|$|E
25|$|Before the Monte Carlo {{method was}} developed, {{simulations}} tested a previously understood <b>deterministic</b> problem and statistical sampling {{was used to}} estimate uncertainties in the simulations. Monte Carlo simulations invert this approach, solving <b>deterministic</b> problems using a probabilistic analog (see Simulated annealing).|$|E
25|$|Geraud Senizergues (1997) {{proved that}} the {{equivalence}} problem for <b>deterministic</b> PDA (i.e. given two <b>deterministic</b> PDA A and B, is L(A)=L(B)?) is decidable, a proof that earned him the 2002 Gödel Prize. For nondeterministic PDA, equivalence is undecidable.|$|E
25|$|MWI is a realist, <b>deterministic,</b> arguably local theory, akin to {{classical}} physics (including {{the theory of}} relativity), {{at the expense of}} losing counterfactual definiteness. MWI achieves this by removing wavefunction collapse, which is indeterministic and non-local, from the <b>deterministic</b> and local equations of quantum theory.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{models can}} be <b>deterministic</b> or stochastic.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} exactly one {{production}} for each symbol, then the L-system {{is said to}} be <b>deterministic</b> (a <b>deterministic</b> context-free L-system is popularly called a D0L system). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a stochastic L-system.|$|E
25|$|Immaterial souls exist, but {{are part}} of <b>deterministic</b> framework.|$|E
25|$|Prolog systems {{typically}} {{implement a}} well-known optimization method called tail call optimization (TCO) for <b>deterministic</b> predicates exhibiting tail recursion or, more generally, tail calls: A clause's stack frame is discarded before performing {{a call in}} a tail position. Therefore, <b>deterministic</b> tail-recursive predicates are executed with constant stack space, like loops in other languages.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>deterministic</b> and probabalistic {{models have}} been used, and are still in use.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} shown, keys {{are listed in}} the nodes and values below them. Each {{complete}} English word has an arbitrary integer value associated with it. A trie {{can be seen as a}} tree-shaped <b>deterministic</b> finite automaton. Each finite language is generated by a trie automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a <b>deterministic</b> acyclic finite state automaton.|$|E
25|$|Fundamental debate {{continues}} {{over whether}} the physical universe {{is likely to be}} <b>deterministic.</b> Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out indeterminism with respect to violations of causal closure, {{it can be used to}} identify indeterminism in natural law. Interpretations of quantum mechanics at present are both <b>deterministic</b> and indeterministic, and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.|$|E
25|$|This {{notion of}} Maupertuis, {{although}} somewhat <b>deterministic</b> today, does capture {{much of the}} essence of mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of context-free grammar parsing {{is determined by}} the automaton that accepts it. <b>Deterministic</b> context-free grammars are accepted by <b>deterministic</b> pushdown automata and can be parsed in linear time, for example by the LR parser. This is a subset of the context-free grammars which are accepted by the pushdown automaton and can be parsed in polynomial time, for example by the CYK algorithm. Unambiguous context-free grammars can be nondeterministic.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} the entire {{universe}} is a <b>deterministic</b> system has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
25|$|Both the <b>deterministic</b> {{and random}} {{components}} of signal propagation are usually considered {{detrimental to the}} overall performance of a wireless network.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{acceptance}} criterion is final state, {{and it is}} this {{acceptance criterion}} which is used to define the <b>deterministic</b> context-free languages.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{most often}} {{spoke of a}} <b>deterministic</b> universe, Poincaré said that the {{subconscious}} generation of new possibilities involves chance.|$|E
25|$|Determinism is a {{property}} characterizing state changes {{due to the}} passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant {{is a function of the}} state in the present (see time evolution). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is <b>deterministic</b> or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is <b>deterministic</b> and the other not.|$|E
25|$|Simulations can {{be based}} on either {{integration}} of differential equations without use of random numbers (<b>deterministic</b> simulations) or {{be based on}} random events (stochastic simulations).|$|E
25|$|SAT is in NP {{because any}} {{assignment}} of Boolean values to Boolean variables that is claimed {{to satisfy the}} given expression can be verified in polynomial time by a <b>deterministic</b> Turing machine. (The statements verifiable in polynomial time by a <b>deterministic</b> Turing machine and solvable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine are totally equivalent, and {{the proof can be}} found in many textbooks, for example Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation, section 7.3.).|$|E
25|$|A few {{advocates of}} <b>deterministic</b> models {{have not given}} up on local hidden variables. For example, Gerard 't Hooft {{has argued that the}} superdeterminism {{loophole}} cannot be dismissed.|$|E
25|$|These {{questions}} are not independent. For example, {{the number of}} scenarios constructed will affect both the tractability of the <b>deterministic</b> equivalent {{and the quality of}} the obtained solutions.|$|E
