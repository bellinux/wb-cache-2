There, they withstood {{three days of}} attacks from LSSAH until 6 March, when their positions began to be encircled by LSSAH and the SS-Totenkopf Division. During {{the next few days}} the brigade retreated north of the Mzha River to Rakitnoye, which was <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 9 March.

5|$|Aflaq's {{downfall}} {{caused a}} split within the Ba'ath Party; {{the party was}} de facto dissolved and two Ba'ath Parties were established, one Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party and one Syrian-led Ba'ath Party. The Syrian-led party was led by Jadid and his supporters and hailed Zaki al-Arsuzi, {{the founder of the}} Arab Ba'ath in 1940, as the father of Ba'athist thought, while the Iraqi-led party led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein, still proclaimed Aflaq to be the founder of Ba'athist thought. In February 1966 at the Ninth National Congress, held after the coup which ousted the pro-Aflaq faction, the Iraqi delegation split with the Syrian Ba'athists. The Iraqi's held the true Ninth National Congress in February 1968 in Beirut, and elected Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Aflaq's election to the Secretary Generalship also proved to be his final break with al-Bitar; before the congress convened al-Bitar announced that he had left the Ba'ath Party and <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Ba'athist movement as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E

5000|$|... "Not <b>Giving</b> <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> Love" [...] is {{a trance}} song. [...] It also {{features}} euphoric synths and pulsating beats. According to Idolator's Robbie Daw, the opening lyrics to 'Not <b>Giving</b> <b>Up</b> <b>On</b> Love' could almost be describing Sophie’s feelings about her chart fortunes {{over the past}} year: [...] "I know you’re feeling restless, like life’s not on your side/It’s weighing heavy on your mind."In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Hold me now, nothing else matters, it’s {{just the two of}} us / And if it all falls down, nothing else matters, you know we’re strong enough / I’m not <b>giving</b> <b>up,</b> I’m not <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> us / I said I’m not <b>giving</b> <b>up,</b> I’m not <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> love." ...|$|R

5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out until she had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E

25|$|According to Palestinian {{historian}} Nur Masalha, Eretz Israel was {{a religious}} concept which was turned by Zionists {{into a political}} doctrine in order to emphasize an exclusive Jewish right of possession regardless of the Arab presence.
