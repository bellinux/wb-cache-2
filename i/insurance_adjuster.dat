40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if severity of osteoarthritis-related knee pain {{is associated with}} a willingness to undergo total knee replacement (TKR) and whether this association is confounded or modified by components of socioeconomic status and health care coverage. MethodsCross-sectional analysis was conducted among 3, 530 Osteoarthritis Initiative study participants. Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of knee pain severity (where 0 =none, 1 - 3 =mild, 4 - 7 =moderate, and 8 - 10 =severe) on willingness to undergo TKR. Stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate whether socioeconomic status and health care coverage modify the effect of knee pain severity on willingness. Results: Participants with severe knee pain, compared to participants without pain, were less willing to undergo TKR (odds ratio [OR] 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0. 57 - 0. 93). This association was attenuated when adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, depression, health insurance coverage, prescription medicine coverage, health care source, education, income, employment, race, and marital status (adjusted OR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 24). The odds of willingness to undergo TKR were significantly lower in those with the highest level of pain, compared to those without pain, among participants without health <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR 0. 08, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 56), but not among those with health <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 38), when adjusted for demographic, clinical, health care access, and socioeconomic factors (P= 0. 015). However, < 5 % of participants were without health insurance. Conclusion: Among participants without health insurance, severe knee pain was paradoxically associated with less willingness to undergo TKR. Policies that improve access to quality health care may affect patient preferences and increase utilization of TKR surgery among vulnerable populations...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} examine whether rates of {{inappropriate}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) differ by demographic characteristics and insurance status. BackgroundPrior {{studies have found that}} blacks, women, and those who have public or no health insurance are less likely to undergo PCI. Whether this reflects potential overuse in whites, men, and privately insured patients, in addition to underuse in disadvantaged populations, is unknown. MethodsWithin the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, we identified 221, 254 nonacute PCIs performed between July 2009 and March 2011. The appropriateness of PCI was determined using the Appropriate Use Criteria for coronary revascularization. Multivariable hierarchical regression was used to evaluate the association between patient demographics and insurance status and inappropriate PCI, as defined by the Appropriate Use Criteria. ResultsOf 211, 254 nonacute PCIs, 25, 749 (12. 2 %) were classified as inappropriate. After multivariable adjustment, men (adjusted odd ratio [OR]: 1. 08 [95 % CI: 1. 05 to 1. 11]; p < 0. 001) and whites (adjusted OR: 1. 09 [95 % CI: 1. 05 to 1. 14]; p < 0. 001) were more likely to undergo an inappropriate PCI in comparison with women and nonwhites. Compared with privately insured patients, those who had Medicare (adjusted OR: 0. 85 [95 % CI: 0. 83 to 0. 88]), other public <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR: 0. 78 [95 % CI: 0. 73 to 0. 83]), and no <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR: 0. 56 [95 % CI: 0. 50 to 0. 61]) were less likely to undergo an inappropriate PCI (p < 0. 001). In addition, compared with urban hospitals, those admitted at rural hospitals were less likely to undergo inappropriate PCI, whereas those at suburban hospitals were more likely. ConclusionsFor nonacute indications, PCIs categorized as inappropriate were more commonly performed in men, whites, and those who had private insurance. Higher rates of PCI in these patient populations may, in part, be due to procedural overuse...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveStreptococcal {{bacteremia}} {{occurs during}} hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), {{and treatment of}} active oral disease may reduce this risk. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the type, number, and costs of pre-transplantation dental procedures in this population. Study DesignData were collected retrospectively from the records of patients who were to undergo HCT. The type, number, and costs of dental procedures were determined based on median charges of MassHealth (the Medicaid program in Massachusetts) and also on the median “usual and customary” fees charged by dentists in Massachusetts. ResultsA total of 405 patients were evaluated. There were 243 men (60 %) and 162 women, with a median age of 53 years. The median and average costs (in US dollars) of dental treatment before HCT were $ 275 and $ 384, respectively, for patients covered by MassHealth and $ 368 and $ 522, respectively, for those with private <b>insurance,</b> <b>adjusted</b> to 2012 levels. ConclusionsDental evaluation before HCT is an economical way for patients to minimize the risk of localized infection and possibly reduce the risk of bacteremia that may prolong the length of hospitalization...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the health-seeking {{behavior of the}} families of children presenting with congenital and developmental cataract attending "Instituto Brasileiro de Oftalmologia" (IBOL), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: Caregivers of consecutive eligible children were interviewed using a pretested questionnaire and medical records were reviewed to collect information about their health-seeking behavior and socioeconomic status in June and July of 2008. RESULTS: Data from 70 children were gathered, from which 42 (60. 0 %) had bilateral disease. Fifty-eight (82. 9 %) cases were considered congenital and 12 (17. 1 %) developmental. Presentation delay was observed in 33 (47. 1 %) children. Having <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> OR 0. 17; 95 % CI 0. 04 - 0. 82) and being the only child (adjusted OR 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 04 - 0. 69) decreased likelihood of late presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed detection and presentation for treatment of non-traumatic pediatric cataract are still significant problems {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} parental employment {{and health insurance}} coverage among children with and without special health care needs.

METHODS: Data from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed for 21, 415 children aged 5 to 17 years, including 1604 children with special needs. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of special needs on the odds of full-time parental employment and on {{the odds of a}} child's being uninsured, having Medicaid, or having employer-sponsored insurance. RESULTS: Parents of children with special needs had less full-time employment. Their children had lower odds of having employer-sponsored <b>insurance</b> (<b>adjusted</b> odds ratio [OR] = 0. 7) than other children. Children with special needs had greater odds of Medicaid coverage (adjusted OR = 2. 3 - 5. 1, depending on family income). Children with and without special needs were equally likely to be uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Lower full-time employment among parents of children with special needs contributes to the children's being less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance. Medicaid covers many children with special needs, but many others remain uninsured...|$|R
