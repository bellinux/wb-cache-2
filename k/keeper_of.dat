5|$|Peter Melbourne {{was made}} <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> the Melbourne estate in 1377 {{with an annual}} income of £10. He was granted another 66s8d in 1386, and 10marks (£613s4d) in 1395.

The younger Peter Melbourne {{was involved in the}} upbringing of the future Henry IV during the reign of Richard II. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year.
