Apple <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, {{was used to}} speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among dealers, who blamed Apple's poor business planning.|$|E

5|$|The {{financing}} of war expenditures by {{the means of}} currency issues (printing money) {{was by far the}} major avenue resorted to by the Confederate government. Between 1862 and 1865, more than 60% of total revenue was created in this way. While the North <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> money supply during the war, the money supply in the South increased twenty times over.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991 Croatia had no regular army, and {{in an effort to}} bolster its defence the country <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> police force to about 20,000. The force's most effective component was its 3,000-strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure. There were also a 9,000–10,000-strong regionally-organized reserve police, grouped into 16 battalions and 10 companies. The reserve police carried only small arms, and a portion of the force was unarmed. Although the Croatian government responded in May by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG), its development was hampered by a United Nations arms embargo introduced in September. On 12 September the ZNG was ordered to blockade all JNA facilities it could reach, beginning the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|By the 2006 general election, the FPÖ {{returned}} to promoting anti-immigration, anti-Islam and Eurosceptic issues.

The subsequent coalition between the SPÖ and the ÖVP left both parties in opposition. In the 2008 general election both the FPÖ and the BZÖ rose significantly {{at the expense of}} the SPÖ and the ÖVP. Both parties increased their percentage of the vote by about 6.5%, with the FPÖ at 17.4% and the BZÖ at 10.7%together gaining 28.2%, and thus both breaking the record vote for the FPÖ in the 1999 election. In the 2009 European Parliament election the FPÖ <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> 2004 results, winning 12.8% of the vote and 2 seats.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17mi (27km) wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast. Early on October 24 Kenna {{became a major}} hurricane, and in a 24‑hour period the hurricane more than <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> windspeed from 70mph (115km/h) winds to 145mph (235km/h). After turning {{to the north and}} northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) early on October 25 while located about 255mi (410km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913mbar (hPa), the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s {{brought the}} {{addition}} of the Wild Mouse, the only Wild Mouse roller coaster designed by Dutch company Vekoma. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at Wiener Prater in Austria and Alton Towers in England, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, lumberjack and acrobatics shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In {{the early years of the}} 21stcentury, additions to the waterpark <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> size and led to a new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone.|$|E
5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the demand on city services, it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E

5|$|The route had <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> {{patronage}} {{since its}} introduction by 1953—the {{last year it}} was operated by DNL. From 1954 the route was taken over by Widerøe, who introduced smaller Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter aircraft. The Widerøe seaplane service was flown on behalf of DNL and later Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and remained until 1963. Varangfly—based in Kirkenes—was established in 1959 by general aviation enthusiasts from Kirkenes Flyklubb. The airline originally had two seaplanes, a two-seat Piper J-3 Cub and a five-seat Norsk Flyindustri C-5 Polar. Operations started on 17 June 1960. The company gradually developed services within scheduled, charter and air ambulance services. Varangfly later also bought an eight-seat land aircraft which was operated to Lakselv and Bardufoss, and to Ivalo Airport in Finland, where i corresponded with Finnair's service to Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved {{to gain control}} of the Albertan, the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> circulation.|$|E
5|$|With closer {{proximity}} to schools, more parking, and double {{the availability of}} shelf space, the village purchased the former station for $12,500 ($ today) and leased the building and its acre of land to the library. The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was dedicated and the village board named the street {{that led to the}} library Library Road. With its own space, the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and <b>doubled</b> <b>its</b> operating hours. Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed its name from the Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E
