40|$|Experiments on {{the effect}} of {{homeopathy}} in plants are being conducted by growers. Benefic effects are several, especially the production of residue-free plants, very important to medicinal plants. The objective of the present trial was to establish the reaction of Porophyllum ruderale to five different <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations,</b> concerning the tannin yield of leaves and roots. <b>Homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> elicited significant effects, either increasing, or decreasing tannin yield. Single applications of Sulphur, Natrium muriaticum, Kalium phosphoricum and Calcarea carbonica at the 4 CH dynamization increased tannin yield 240 - 288 hours after application; Silicea terra and Magnesium carbonicum 4 CH between 288 - 336 hours after application. Kalium phosphoricum and Calcarea carbonica were the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> that elicited maximal increase in tannin yield of leaves. The use of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> in P. ruderale employed in human nutrition may reduce tannin yield, reduce astringency and improve palatability. On the other hand, <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> that increase pharmacologically active compounds is of interest to phytotherapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> {{are used}} in {{homeopathy}} and anthroposophic medicine. Although {{there is evidence of}} effectiveness in several clinical studies, including double-blinded randomized controlled trials, their nature and mode of action could not be explained with current scientific approaches yet. Several physical methods have already been applied to investigate <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> but it is yet unclear which methods are best suited to identify characteristic physicochemical properties of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> with UV-spectroscopy. In a blinded, randomized, controlled experiment <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of copper sulfate (CuSO 4; 11 c– 30 c), quartz (SiO 2; 10 c– 30 c, i. e., centesimal dilution steps) and sulfur (S; 11 ×– 30 ×, i. e., decimal dilution steps) and controls (one-time succussed diluent) were investigated using UV-spectroscopy and tested for contamination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The UV transmission for <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of CuSO 4 preparations was significantly lower than in controls. The transmission seemed to be also lower for both SiO 2 and S, but not significant. The mean effect size (95 % confidence interval) was similar for the homeopathic preparations: CuSO 4 (pooled data) 0. 0544 % (0. 0260 – 0. 0827 %), SiO 2 0. 0323 % (– 0. 0064 % to 0. 0710 %) and S 0. 0281 % (– 0. 0520 % to 0. 1082 %). UV transmission values of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> had a significantly higher variability compared to controls. In none of the samples the concentration of any element analyzed by ICP-MS exceeded 100 [*]ppb. Lower transmission of UV light may indicate that <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> are less structured or more dynamic than their succussed pure solvent...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> on the {{activities}} of the leaf-cutting ants Acromyrmex spp. was studied. A field experiment involving ant nests in six experimental areas was performed using a randomised complete block design. Within each block, every ant nest was considered to represent one repetition. The treatments consisted of the following: Belladonna <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of macerated or triturated Acromyrmex spp. adults, <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of macerated or triturated ant nest fungus (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus) collected from Acromyrmex laticeps and Acromyrmex heyeri nests, a homeopathy Belladonna, and dynamised water. All of the homeopathic treatments were tested at the 30 CH (thirtieth centesimal Hahnemannian) dynamisation. An untreated nest served as the control. The total number of ants from each trail was counted, including both those carrying or not-carrying green plant fragments, immediately before the daily homeopathic applications. All of the tested <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations,</b> except for the water, significantly reduced the activity level of Acromyrmex spp. The <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of Belladonna and the macerated nosodes of Acromyrmex spp. reduced the activity level of the ants beginning with the sixth day after the first treatment application; the activity level reduction effect lasted more than 20 days after the last application. ...|$|R

In previous investigations, <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> had significantly lower UV light transmissions than controls. The aim of this study was to explore the possible effects of external factors (UV light and temperature) on the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations.</b> <b>Homeopathic</b> centesimal (c) dilutions, 1 c to 30 c, of copper sulfate (CuSO 4), decimal dilutions of sulfur (S 8), 1 x to 30 x, and controls (succussed potentization medium) were prepared, randomized, and blinded. UV transmission was measured at six different time points after preparation (from 4 to 256 days). In addition, one series of samples was exposed to UV light of a sterilization lamp for 12 h, one was incubated at 37 °C for 24 [*]h, and one was heated to 90 °C for 15 [*]min. UV light transmission values from 190 or 220 [*]nm to 340 [*]nm were measured several times and averaged. After each exposure, UV transmission of the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> of CuSO 4 was significantly reduced compared to the controls, particularly after heating to 37 °C. Overall, the nonexposed CuSO 4 preparations did not show significantly lower UV transmission compared to controls; however, the pooled subgroup of measurements at days 26, 33, and 110 yielded significant differences. UV light transmission for S 8 preparations did not show any differences compared to controls. Our conclusion is that exposure to external factors, incubation at 37 °C in particular, increases the difference in light transmission of <b>homeopathic</b> CuSO 4 <b>preparations</b> compared to controls...|$|R

40|$|Background: {{aluminum}} toxicity is {{the most}} important factor limiting the growth of plants in acid soils, whereas current treatments are unfeasible. For this reason, alternatives are sought for, among which homeopathic treatment. Aims: this study aimed at evaluating the influence of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> Alumina 6 cH, Alumina 12 cH, Calcarea carbonica 6 cH and Calcarea carbonica 12 cH on the germination and vigor of lettuce seeds subjected to toxic levels of aluminum in paper-solution. At the same time, it was sought to develop a new procedure to apply <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> in plants (pelleting). Methods: the statistical design was entirely randomized (CRD) with 6 treatments and 4 repetitions. Treatments included: 1) pelleted seeds/talc + Alum 6 cH; 2) pelleted seeds/talc + Alum 12 cH; 3) pelleted seed/talc + Calc 6 cH; 4) pelleted seeds/talc + Calc 12 cH; 5) pelleted seeds/talc + distilled water; 6) non pelleted seeds (control).

40|$|Background:&# 13; &# 13; Experimental {{research}} {{on the effects of}} treatments with <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> on plants was last reviewed in 1990. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; Aims:&# 13; &# 13; The objective was to compile a systematic literature review on plant bioassays in homeopathic basic research using predefined criteria. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; Methods:&# 13; &# 13; Literature search was carried out on publications that reported experiments with <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> on whole plants, seeds, plant parts or cells from 1920 to 2010, in healthy, abiotically or biotically stressed conditions. Outcomes had to be measured by established state-of-the-art procedures and statistically evaluated. Using a Manuscript Information Score (MIS) those publications were identified that provided sufficient information for proper interpretation (MIS > 5). Further evaluation focused on the use of adequate controls to investigate specific effects of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations</b> and on the use of systematic negative control experiments to ensure proper system performance. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; Results:&# 13; &# 13; A total of 157 publications with plants were identified [1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3]. The 157 publications described a total of 167 experimental studies. 84 studies included statistics and 48 had a MIS > 5 allowing proper interpretation. 29 studies were identified with adequate controls to identify specific effects of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>preparations,</b> reporting significant effects of decimal and centesimal homeopathic potencies, including dilution levels beyond AvogadroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s number. Studies that tested series of consecutive potency levels reported a non-linear and discontinuous relation between effect and potency level.
