5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. <b>For</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

We tried to do this with almost all the characters in this episode: , Laura, Kara, Lee. We ripped everything out from under them then sat back to see what they would do. What were their individual breaking points? And if they did break, would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was {{a certain amount of}} guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E

500|$|On 23 October, the {{day after}} the broadcast, Griffin {{announced}} he would be lodging a formal complaint over the programme, over its focus on BNP issues rather than topical subjects. Griffin stated, [...] "There is not much support <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> , because the place is dominated by ethnic minorities. There is an ethnic minority that supports me: the English. But there's not many of them left." [...] A spokesman for the BNP said that London was too [...] "multicultural" [...] to be fair to it and that a location like the northwest of England would have been more favourable. The BNP were also going to file a Freedom of Information Request to the BBC to determine the decision-making process behind hosting the programme in London, and in allowing the debate to focus on the BNP, arguing that criticism of the BNP had dominated the whole programme.|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{appointment}} as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral {{required him to}} spend three months annually as the canon in residence, with administrative and preaching duties. [...] Following his {{appointment as}} canon, he was also appointed Treasurer of the Cathedral. His preaching on Sunday afternoons {{caught the attention of}} William Temple, Lang's future successor at both York and Canterbury, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford. Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London's sermons, listening to Lang brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: [...] "I can remember all his points, just because their connexion is inevitable.... And <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> is no doubt that this is the more edifying by far." [...] Lang {{was a member of the}} cathedral's governing body, the Dean and Chapter, and was responsible for the organisation of special occasions, such as the service of thanksgiving for King Edward VII's recovery from appendicitis in July 1902.|$|E

He is assigned {{to negotiate with the}} ringleader of a Manhattan bank heist. Inside Man marks Washington's fourth collaboration with director Spike Lee. After being approached by Lee to star in the film, he was given the opportunity to play Frazier or Dalton Russell, but turned down the latter, citing concerns over the character's disguise. TotalFilm.com|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=April 13, 2013|work=Total Film}} Washington cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration: [...] "I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier—Russell ’s script is heavy with great dialogue. My character does a lot of talking! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers, and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who’s going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps as a {{means of}} {{avoiding}} or clarifying some ambiguities created by the fact that [...] "este" [...] ( [...] > [...] ) and [...] "esse" [...] have merged into the same word, informal BP often uses the demonstrative pronoun with some adverb that indicates its placement in relation to the addressee: if there are two skirts in a room and one says, Pega essa saia para mim (Take this skirt <b>for</b> <b>me),</b> <b>there</b> may be some doubt about which of them must be taken so one may say Pega essa aí (Take this one there near you") in the original sense of the use of [...] "essa", or Pega essa saia aqui (Take this one here).|$|E

2500|$|In early 2009 he was, {{by his own}} admission, {{personally}} involved in the re-activation of notorious Riyadus-Salikhin suicide formation, first set-up and led by Basayev between 1999 and 2004; in the next months a string of suicide attacks killed dozens of people (mostly police officers) and critically injured the Ingush president Yunus-bek Yevkurov, raising fears of a new campaign of attacks directed against Russian civilians. In a July 2009 interview with Prague Watchdog, when asked if people should expect a repetition of events like the Moscow hostage crisis, Umarov responded: [...] "If that is the will of Allah. Shamil [...] {{did not have the}} opportunities I have right now. [...] As far as possible we will try to avoid civilian targets, but <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> are no civilians in Russia. Why? Because a genocide of our people is being carried out with their tacit consent."

2500|$|After being {{discharged}} from his duties in the Navy, as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where he [...] "plunged into the heady {{excitement of the}} new music and the blossoming bebop scene." [...] After touring with King Kolax, he joined a Philly-based band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane's playing by his former Navy buddy, the trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters. In Philadelphia after the war, he studied jazz theory with guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole and continued under Sandole's tutelage through the early 1950s. Originally an altoist, in 1947 Coltrane also began playing tenor saxophone with the Eddie Vinson Band. Coltrane later referred to {{this point in his}} life as a time when [...] "a wider area of listening opened up <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> were many things that people like Hawk , and Ben [...] and Tab Smith were doing in the '40s that I didn't understand, but that I felt emotionally." [...] A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. [...] "Hasaan was the clue to ... the system that Trane uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane’s melodic concept." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E
