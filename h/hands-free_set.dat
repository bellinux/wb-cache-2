40|$|Many {{experiments}} using driving simulators or real roads {{have shown}} that using a cellular phone while driving may cause an accident because it delays visual information processing by the driver. In this research, we examined the influence on driving performance of cellular phone use on a course that simulated streets. Driving conditions were driving only, listening to the car radio, hands-free cellular phone use and using a cellular phone with the left hand. Driving performance measurements included braking response time to the brake lights of a preceding car, eye movement, distance from the vehicle in front and lane observance. The subjects were 50 drivers, including ten driving instructors. The mean glance duration when manipulating a cellular phone was longer than when manipulating a <b>hands-free</b> <b>set</b> or car stereo. Braking reaction delay time increased in the following order: driving only, car radio, hands-free and, longest of all, cellular phone. When the cellular phone was used, car speed was slowest, and {{the distance from the}} vehicle in front became the longest. Glance duration other than to the front, indicating divided attention, was shortest during the cellular phone use and there were also fewer instances of eye movement. In the case of cellular phone use, stable driving appeared to be more difficult, as there was substantial steering wheel deflection. In this experiment, it was confirmed that use of a <b>hands-free</b> <b>set</b> is effective to some extent, but driving performance was poorer than with driving only. Even though different forms of in-vehicle information apparatus were used, a delay in information processing was consistently found...|$|E
40|$|Mentor: Manoj Monga MD (Urologic Surgery) Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{comparative}} evaluation of ultrasonic, pneumatic, and dual ultrasonic lithotripsy {{to predict the}} safety of probes on urinary tract tissue. Methods: Lithotriptors (medical device used to breakup kidney stones) tested were the Swiss Lithoclast Ultra (ultrasonic only - US, and ultrasonic-pneumatic combination US+P), and the Gyrus ACMI Cyberwand (dual ultrasonic). Fresh porcine ureters, bladders, and renal pelvis tissues were used for testing. A <b>hands-free</b> <b>set</b> up was used with each probe to vertically apply no pressure, 400 g, or 700 g of pressure for a duration of 3 seconds, 5 seconds or 180 seconds. Repetitive testing of each tissue/pressure/time combination was performed, {{for a total of}} 351 trials. Conclusion: All devices afforded a level of safety at tissue durations typical of inadvertent intraoperative contact (3 - 5 seconds), though the Lithoclast US-only was superior with regard to perforation for all tissue types. Overall, very similar results were observed between the Lithoclast US+P and Cyberwand. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|E

30|$|When <b>hands-free</b> {{telephone}} <b>sets</b> were introduced, acoustic echoes became {{another significant}} problem in many telecommunication scenarios. Unlike the echo paths of telephone hybrids, acoustic echo paths are described by significantly longer typically non-sparse impulse responses, {{as described by}} Hänsler in [24, 25]. This increased complexity fueled the search for efficient frequency-subband [26, 27] and discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-domain algorithms [28 – 30], where multiple shorter adaptive filters or individual DFT bins, respectively, are adapted independently and lead to faster convergence and increased computational efficiency. As the block processing of computationally efficient DFT-domain algorithms implies large algorithmic delays, the generalized multidelay adaptive filter was developed which reduces the block size by partitioning the impulse responses [31, 32]. Note that {{it is also possible}} to reduce this delay on cost of computational efficiency by choosing an appropriate block-overlap for single-partition processing [4].|$|R
40|$|VTI was {{commissioned}} by the Swedish Government to compile relevant research on mobile phone and other communication device usage whilst driving. Thus, a sub-set of those activities that can distract a driver in traffic are treated in the compilation. A review of several hundred publications reveals that the topic is very complex. Even though {{a large number of}} controlled studies show that using a mobile telephone while driving has a negative impact on driving performance, this was not reflected by a strong increase in crash rates in real traffic. Both the conversation itself and manipulating a telephone have negative effects on driving performance. When writing a SMS or using a telephone in a similar manner the driver takes the eyes off the road, often several times consecutively, and at times for longer periods of time. This results in decreased control of the vehicle and an increased risk that the driver misses crucial events in traffic. During a telephone conversation the driver does tend to look at the road, but nevertheless also conversation research has found prolonged reaction times and missed traffic events. Many drivers think that it is safer to use a <b>hands-free</b> <b>set</b> than a handheld telephone, but this has not been confirmed by the available research. Most EU countries have hands-free requirements, however, many drivers do not comply with the legislation. Bans on handheld mobile phones and on texting when driving do not appear {{to reduce the number of}} crashes...|$|E
40|$|Hands-free {{communication}} {{techniques are}} becoming increasingly important {{in the world of}} modern telephony. The convenience of hands-free links is invaluable in teleconferencing situations, automobiles and even in personal communications. The loud-speaker and microphone on a <b>hands-free</b> <b>set</b> are inherently coupled acoustically, producing an echo which degrades the quality of conversation over such a link. The conventional acoustic echo cancellation method is gain control which provides a half-duplex communication link. Research into adaptive filters which can provide a full-duplex communication link is intense but transparent transmission of speech over a hands-free link remains an elusive goal. Conventional acoustic echo cancellers are concerned with minimizing an objective measure of the level of echo. This thesis presents a study of two adaptive filtering structures which are based on the goal of providing the best subjective echo cancellation possible. The adaptive filtering algorithms attempt to give the echo the same spectral shape as the absolute hearing threshold curve, in order to minimize the echo's audibility. The filtered-E LMS algorithm, considered first, was found not to perform the kind of frequency weighting desired. A proposed subband adaptive filter with perceptually-based adaptive tap assignment, when trained with natural speech, is capable of providing a noticeable improvement in audible echo cancellation; however, when trained with bandlimited speech, the algorithm's performance was found to be only slightly better or comparable to the fixed tap assignment algorithm in terms of audible echo cancellation. The subband adaptive filtering algorithm is evaluated by means of simple listening tests performed by the author...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic echo {{cancellation}} {{is an attractive}} way to enhance speech quality and provide a full-duplex communication channel for hands-free telephony. Among the many implementation challenges, the problem of "double talk" {{is considered one of}} the toughest. When near-end speech and the acoustic echo of the far-end speech are simultaneously present in the microphone signal, it is very difficult to separate these two components and provide satisfactory echo attenuation. After providing a thorough overview of the application and the major adaptive filtering algorithms used in {{echo cancellation}}, this thesis presents an in-depth study of the published techniques for dealing with double talk. We classify these existing approaches according to their underlying methodology, such as signal level comparison, signal correlation, weight progression monitoring, and dual filter architecture. The strengths and weaknesses of a number of representative algorithms are discussed in some detail. We argue that detection of echo path changes yields a more robust echo canceller than direct double talk detection. The major contribution of this thesis is the development of a novel variable step size approach that uses a measure of the correlation between successive gradient estimates to control the system's adaptation rate. Two main algorithms, denoted GC-VSS 3 and PC-VSS, are derived by applying this approach to the Least Mean Squares and Affine Projection algorithms, respectively. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in a double talk environment. This is done through a series of simulation experiments using white noise, coloured noise, and recorded speech as the input signals. We also show how an auxiliary double talk detector, based on the proposed variable step size technique, may be employed to control the peripheral echo suppression components that are usually required in a <b>hands-free</b> telephone <b>set.</b> Finally, computational complexity is analyzed and shown to be reasonable for practical implementation when certain beneficial properties of the adaptive filter structure are exploited...|$|R
