40|$|Based on the {{occupant}} injury severity in side pole impact, this paper conducted a computer simulation {{study on the}} side pole impact of a passenger car. The injury criterion and parameters of dummy, the side structure deformation and acceleration of the car body were thoroughly analyzed {{in terms of the}} crash characteristics of the car in side pole impact. The countermeasures for improving the strength of the door-sill-beam and the <b>floor</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> were presented. Simulation results have shown that the side pole impact increases occupant injury risk and makes more intrusion on the side structure of the body, compared with car to barrier side impact. The passenger car safety performance can be improved in side pole impact by strengthening the door-sill-beam and the <b>floor</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member...</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. South Africa {{entered a}} new {{political}} dispensation in 1994. Prior to 1994 South Africa had a parliamentary governing system, which was based upon the British Westminster system. The electoral system, which was {{in place at the}} time, was a majoritarian electoral system of winner-takes-all, also known as the constituency system. The whole of South Africa was divided into different constituencies and the candidate in a constituency who received the majority of votes in an election, became the representative in Parliament. As in other Western democracies, <b>floor</b> <b>crossing</b> of parliamentary <b>members</b> in the parliamentary governing system was a common feature. Since 1994, in the new political dispensation, South Africa has accepted a mixed governing system with a proportional electoral system. The objective of a proportional electoral system is that parliament, in its political party composition, has to be a true reflection of the proportion of votes which each party received in a national election. Voters therefore vote for political parties and not for individual candidates, {{as is the case in}} a constituency system. In the proportional electoral system, a candidate becomes a representative in Parliament if his/her political party has nominated him/her. Within this proportional electoral system a problem arises with <b>floor</b> <b>crossing.</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>crossing</b> creates a potentially un-democratic situation, which could lead to a disruption of the balance of power. The existence of a defection clause could therefore exchange the votes of the electorate. The implication is that, if the electorate's vote is exchangeable after it had been cast in favour of a particular party or candidate, political power may transfer from one party to another, certain parties may be strengthened or weakened and existing parties may disappear and new parties my come about without an election having taken place. The aim of this study is to address the problem of floor-crossing in South African party politics. The study entails a literature overview and an empirical investigation into the defection clause, in an effort to determine the nature and impact of floor-crossing within the South African political system. From the study it appears that the majority of South African political parties perceive <b>floor</b> <b>crossing</b> to be a legitimate political activity, but the parties are opposed to unconditional <b>floor</b> <b>crossing.</b> The perception exists that the voting choices of the electorate are being flouted. Floor-crossing furthermore only favour the ruling party many times, as the majority of floor crossers join the strongest party which has the most resources, funds and advantages. <b>Floor</b> <b>crossing</b> is therefore not always an accurate reflection of the choices of voters and could lead to voters becoming apathetic and negative with regards to politicians and politics as a whole. It could furthermore lead to voters not wanting to vote again or see the usefulness of voting and has the potential to create an un-democratic situation in a changing society, such as that of South Africa. It is clear that <b>floor</b> <b>crossing</b> could have a negative impact on South African party politics. Master...|$|R
5000|$|The United Democratic Movement (UDM) unsuccessfully {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} <b>floor</b> <b>crossing.</b> A bill to amend the constitution to again prevent politicians from keeping their seats when joining other parties, dubbed [...] "crosstitutes", was tabled in Parliament in 2008.

50|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>crossing</b> was {{originally}} enabled by {{amendments to the}} Constitution of South Africa and other legislation passed by Parliament.

50|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>crossing</b> was {{particularly}} controversial because South African MPs are elected by proportional representation, and are nominated by political parties on a closed party list before a general election. Voters thus {{vote for a}} political party rather than for an individual MP. However, <b>floor</b> <b>crossing</b> allowed MPs to change parties, with the possible result that {{the composition of the}} elected bodies no longer represented the original vote count.|$|R

The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process.
