40|$|In {{this article}} we develop and defend {{what we call the}} “Trust View” of {{promissory}} <b>obligation,</b> according <b>to</b> which making a promise involves inviting another individual to trust one to do something.

The distinctive wrong involved in breaking a promise is a matter of violating this obligation. We begin by explicating the core notion of “inviting someone to trust one to do something”, suggesting that it involves signaling to the other individual one's recognition of the importance the relevant action has for her, and one’s willingness to license her to have faith or optimism in one's character with regard to the performance of that action. We then turn to a defense of the Trust View, arguing that it has considerable appeal in its own right, that it is distinct from and superior to three similar accounts (T. M. Scanlon's Assurance View, Judith Jarvis Thomson's Reliance View and David Owens' Authority View), and that several objections to it can be answered...|$|R

40|$|Provide a brief {{description}} of the issue and reason for the proposed amendment. If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Overview The present Market Rules do not effectively address the financial risks to the IESO-administered markets from a) sales of registered facilities, and b) expiring letters of credit. A detailed description of these risks is provided below. Sales of Registered Facilities- Overview In a typical sale, a registered facility is sold to a new owner by an existing market participant (“MP”). In many cases, the new owner is unaware of its <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> become an authorized MP including obtaining an OEB license and posting prudential support. Since the new owner is, in most cases, immediately drawing power from the date of sale, they are <b>incurring</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> the IESOadministered markets without providing prudential support that is designed to protect the market in the event the new owner defaults. Currently, the Market Rules require MPs in section 2. 5 of Chapter 7 to advise the IESO of the transfer of registered facilities but many do not do so. The IESO usually becomes aware of such a sale long after the date of sale from either a request from the selling MP for the return of their prudential support, various news media distributions, IESO Market Entry notifications, and/or a change in electricity consumption by the new owner. During this “interim period”, from the date of sale until the new owner posts prudential support and becomes an authorized MP, the market is exposed to financial risks. Generally, it can take a new owner between 2 to 5 months to meet all the market entry requirements to become an authorized MP including obtaining an OEB licence. This is not a hypothetical situation. The IESO has recently had to deal with a new owner of a registered facility missing a margin call and then defaulting on payment of several invoices before it became a fully authorized MP. Fortunately, the new owner had posted prudential support which was sufficient <b>to</b> meet its <b>obligations.</b> But the IESO has had other situations where the new owner has not posted prudential support in a timely manner...|$|R

5000|$|Either the {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy when the period or term is nearing completion, by giving notice {{to the other}} party as required by statute or case law in the jurisdiction. Neither landlord nor tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy before the period has ended, without <b>incurring</b> an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> pay for the months remaining on the lease.

Durations of less than a year must typically receive notice equal to the period of the tenancy - for example, {{the landlord}} must give a month's notice to terminate a tenancy from month to month. However, many jurisdictions have increased these required notice periods, and some have reduced the capacity of a landlord to use them drastically.

40|$|In "Should Race Matter?," David Boonin proposes the {{compensation}} principle: When an agent wrongfully harms another person, she <b>incurs</b> a moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> compensate that {{person for the}} harms she has caused.

Here I argue that {{the compensation}} principle is false because it violates the control principle, the foundational principle of ethics that states that moral responsibility requires control; for an agent to be morally responsible for something, whether or not she does that thing must be within her control. If the compensation principle creates a moral obligation for an agent to compensate a harmed party, failure to do so will result in that agent's being morally blameworthy for failing in her obligation. Because some harms cannot be compensated for, agents who wrongfully harm others will be required to do something that is outside of their control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As a {{political}} doctrine nationalism has four distinctive features which make it unattractive from a liberal perspective. It promotes revisions of external state borders by secession and unification {{in order to}} create homogeneous nation-states; it militates against national and ethnic diversity within the given borders of a state; it regards national obligations as overriding other interests and identities of the nation's members; and it attributes a moral priority <b>to</b> compatriots whichoverrides <b>obligations</b> towards foreigners or foreign countries. The paper briefly examines each of these 'four ugly faces' of nationalism. Although liberal political theory may claim to have most consistently opposed these nationalist propositions, Iargue that traditional liberalism is ill-equipped to reply to questions which involve the legitimacy of boundaries of political communities. This claim is substantiated by a more thorough examination of the question how state border ought to be drawn. Consequentialist, deontological and liberal nationalist approaches are each divided against themselves on the question about whether and how to defend or reject a right to secession. The paper derives an alternative response from linking the legitimacy of secession to a theory of federation. In this view, secession may not only be justified in cases of persistent discrimination and inequality of individual citizenship, but also when fair terms of federation are violated. In multinational states, the claims of territorially concentrated groups to self-government can be generally satisfied by guaranteeing them collective rights to regional autonomy and special representation at the federal level. If, and as long as, the terms of federationare fair, minorities <b>incur</b> an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> maintain the unity of the federation in which they participate both as individual citizens and as distinct political communities within the larger polity. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{his theory}} of criticism, D. N. Walton presupposes that an {{opponent}} either critically questions an argument, without supplementing this questioning with any reasoning of her own, or that she puts forward a critical question and supplements it with a counterargument, that is, with reasoning in defense of an opposite position of her own. In this paper, I {{show that there is}} a kind of in-between critical option for the opponent that needs to be taken into account in any classification of types of criticism, and that should not be overlooked in a system of dialogue norms, nor in a procedure for developing a strategically expedient critique. In this third option, an opponent questions and overtly doubts a statement of the proponent and supplements her doubts with a counterconsideration that explains and motivates her position of critical doubt, yet without supporting any opposite thesis, thereby assisting, as it were, the proponent in his attempt to develop a responsive argumentation, tailor-made to convince this particular opponent. First, I elaborate on the notion of an explanatory counterconsideration. Second, I discuss Walton’s distinction between premises that can be challenged by mere questioning (“ordinary premises” and “assumptions”) and premises that must be challenged by <b>incurring</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> offer counter-argumentation (somewhat confusingly labeled “exceptions”). I contend that the latter type of premises, that I would label “normality premises,” can be attacked without incurring a genuine burden of proof. Instead, it can be attacked by means of incurring a burden of criticism (Van Laar and Krabbe, 2013) that amounts <b>to</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> offer an explanatory counterconsideration, rather than a convincing ex concessis argument. Of course, providing the opponent with the right to discharge her burden of criticism with explanatory counterconsiderations brings a clear strategic ad- vantage to her. It is much less demanding to motivate one’s doubts regarding proposition P, than to convince the proponent of not-P. If we want to encourage opponents to act critically, and proponents to develop responsive arguments, the importance of the notions of an explanatory counterconsideration and of a motivated doubt should be emphasized in the theory of criticism...|$|R
