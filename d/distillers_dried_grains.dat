50|$|In the United States, {{the main}} {{feedstock}} {{for the production}} of ethanol is currently corn. Approximately 2.8 gallons of ethanol are produced from one bushel of corn (0.42 liter per kilogram). While much of the corn turns into ethanol, some of the corn also yields by-products such as DDGS (<b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> with solubles) that can be used as feed for livestock. A bushel of corn produces about 18 pounds of DDGS (320 kilograms of DDGS per metric ton of maize). Although most of the fermentation plants have been built in corn-producing regions, sorghum is also an important feedstock for ethanol production in the Plains states. Pearl millet is showing promise as an ethanol feedstock for the southeastern U.S. and the potential of duckweed is being studied.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> with {{solubles}} (DDGS), {{which are}} rich in energy and protein, {{have been used in}} place of corn and soybean meal in some livestock and poultry feeds, and corn DDGS have become the most popular, economical, and widely available alternative feed ingredient for use in U.S. swine diets in all phases of production. The U.S. Grain Council reported that corn DDGS is used primarily as an energy source in swine diets because it contains approximately the same amount of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) as corn, although the ME content may be slightly reduced when feeding reduced-oil DDGS. A 2007 study highlighted the recent trends in the use of DDGS, as many producers are including 20% DDGS in diets of swine in all categories. Although 20% is the recommended level of inclusion, some producers are successfully using greater inclusion rates. Inclusion rate of up to 35% DDGS has been used in diets fed to nursery pigs and finishing pigs.|$|E

These results demonstrate that the previously suggested maximums of 5 % <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> in nursery diets and 10 % <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> in finishing diets are too conservative. Finally, because the 20 % (nursery) and 30 % (finishing) treatments were the greatest concentrations used in our experiments, additional growth assays are needed to determine the maximum limits for <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> in diets for pigs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{increase}} in production of ethanol from corn and other grains has resulted in growing quantities of byproducts, primarily <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> with solubles (DDGS).

40|$|Ethanol {{mandates}} {{have led}} {{to an increase in}} the production of <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> (DDGs), a co-product of ethanol production that is incorporated into livestock rations. As with most competitive industries, there is some level of price risk in handling DDGs, and there is no DDG futures contract available for managing price risk. Commonly, DDGs are hedged using only corn futures. Our results suggest that cross-hedge risk may be reduced by including soybean meal futures in an encompassing cross-hedge strategy.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of calving season and cow wintering systems on cow and calf performance and economics from conception to slaughter, the effect of supplementing steers <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> while grazing cool season dominated meadow, and a meta-analysis was conducted {{to determine the effect}} supplementing <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> to cattle in forage based growing systems. In the first experiment, cows were bred to calve in spring, summer or fall. Calves from each system were managed as calf-feds or yearlings and followed through finishing. Altering calving season impacted cow BW and BCS but did not affect re-breeding performance or the percent of cows to calve. However, fall calving cows produced fewer weaned calves compared to spring and summer calving cows. In addition, there was a significant effect of calving season on calf finishing performance and economics. Wintering system did not affect performance or profitability of cow systems. The second study evaluated <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grain</b> supplementation to steers grazing cool season meadow. Results from this study suggest that lower levels of DDGS supplementation (0. 6 % BW) do not effect summer ADG or ending BW. However, when supplementation was increased (1. 2 % BW) ADG and ending BW were increased. In addition, supplementing <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> to calves grazing cool season meadow did not affect subsequent feedlot performance but BW at harvest was greater for steers supplemented <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains.</b> The third study, evaluated <b>dried</b> <b>distillers</b> <b>grains</b> supplementation to cattle in forage based growing systems across multiple studies.

40|$|A major {{emphasis}} on ethanol {{production in the}} US {{has led to the}} construction of new ethanol plants and an increased production of <b>distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> plus solubles (DDGS). In the past DDGS came largely from the beverage industry and consisted of several grains used during fermentation. Recently, a majority of the DDGS produced is from corn fermentation for ethanol production. Little research has been conducted to test the use of this new generation DDGS from modern ethanol plants in laying hen diets. Hy-line W- 36 laying hens were used to test an elevated inclusion level of DDGS from modern ethanol plants that can be incorporated into layer diets. Hens were fed a commercial or low-density diet formulated to contain 0 or 15 % DDGS for 25 to 43 wk of age. No differences were observed in the majority of parameters evaluated between hens fed 0 % or 15 % DDGS. However, there was a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in hen-day egg production through 35 wk of age when hens were fed the low-density diet with 15 % DDGS. Hens fed the commercial diet with 15 % DDGS had numerically lower egg production to 32 wk of age, but this was not statistically significant. <b>Distillers</b> <b>dried</b> <b>grains</b> plus solubles proved to be an acceptable feed ingredient for laying hen diets.
