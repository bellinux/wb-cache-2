40|$|Background Homecare {{is facing}} {{one of its}} biggest challenges: the growing {{imbalance}} between the increasing demand for care at home and the decreasing supply of <b>home</b> <b>nurses.</b> The demographic and economic evolutions and trends increasingly confront <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> with caring for patients with frailty, functionalities, and multimorbidities, requiring more intensive and technically complex procedures {{to be done at}} home. Policymakers responding to these trends aim to shift the healthcare system towards a multidimensional, chronic disease-oriented system. Homecare has to engage in this process to help shaping and managing a model of homecare that focuses on the individual, chronic, healthcare needs of each patient, client, or informal caregiver; on patient empowerment; and on continuity of care. Furthermore, as the demand for homecare is continuously growing, questions arise concerning the supply of <b>home</b> <b>nurses,</b> which increases more slowly than the overall demand. Consequently, the role of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> as providers of healthcare has been changing and will continue to change. However, are <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> ready for this changing role and how does <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> respond to these trends and evolutions in primary care? The retention of healthcare workers (what are important factors to stay in the job/healthcare); task shifting (what about the possibility of function differentiation); and task purification (what is the contribution of each team discipline to patient care) are important cornerstones to answer these questions. The ultimate aim of this dissertation was to support <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> in this process by exploring the current and future role of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in the perspective of these three cornerstones. Retention of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> In chapter 2 we used the Belimage Homecare instrument to provide insight in the professional self-image of 758 <b>home</b> <b>nurses.</b> This study highlighted both the positive self-image of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and the existence of a delicate balance between the large degree of autonomy that <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> have and the need to feel supported in their professional role and responsibility. The practice environment, including time pressure, workload and insufficient support, needs to be addressed in order to keep it from having a negative impact on the professional self-image of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in the long-term. Task shifting In chapter 4 the technique of in-depth interviews was used to explore the experiences of twelve <b>home</b> <b>nurses,</b> twelve healthcare assistants and eight <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> managers with regard to the delegation of nursing activities to healthcare assistants; the supervision of healthcare assistants; and the impact of this integration on the work of <b>home</b> <b>nurses.</b> All the participants reacted positively to the employment of healthcare assistants in the organization: healthcare assistants take care of a less care dependent patient population, allowing the <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> to spend more time on more complex, technical nursing care. However, the analysis revealed some barriers, such as a knowledge gap and insecurity felt by healthcare assistants leading to unnecessary patient visits by home nurses; unfamiliarity of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> with the role of delegating activities and supervising healthcare assistants; and poor face-to-face communication between <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and healthcare assistants. These barriers often resulted in a loss of a holistic view on the patient situation. Task purification In chapter 3 the views and experiences of both primary care professionals and hospital healthcare workers were explored with regard to the shift of care from the hospital to the homecare setting. Therefore, in-depth interviews with fifteen <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and eight medical specialists, and two focus groups with eight and fifteen general practitioners, respectively, were performed. Three important statements were highlighted. First, it was difficult for the respondents to make a clear distinction between technical and complex interventions. Therefore, {{more research is needed to}} provide a clear definition of "technical" and "complex" interventions. Secondly, the earlier discharge of more palliative care patients and more chronically ill patients confronts primary care with more intensive and complex care at home and with a shift from pure technical interventions to more intellectual care. Thirdly, for <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> to be ready for these changes, some financial and organizational aspects need to be addressed, such as the investment in specialized home nurses; a financing system that covers the daily (24 -hour) practice of home nurses; the investment in a more and better integrated and properly financed multi- and interdisciplinary collaboration and communication. In chapter 5 we explored the international literature to evaluate the instruments used to measure the activity profile of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and to determine which activities <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> perform in their daily practice. We identified nine studies. They all used different measurement instruments of questionable validity. We found that the activity profile of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> was mainly characterized by a combination of pure technical and surveillance activities with psychosocial and administrative activities. However, the level of abstraction in the activities performed by <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> had a major impact on the interpretation of their activity profile. Consequently, in the scope of the absence of a gold standard to measure the daily activities of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in primary care, we developed and psychometrically tested the 24 -hour recall instrument for <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> in chapter 6. The validity and the interrater reliability of this instrument were high: the proportions observed agreement were very high; the strength of kappa agreement was substantial to almost perfect; the prevalence index showed great variety; and the bias index was low. The findings in this study supported the validity evidence based on test content and the interrater reliability of the 24 -hour recall instrument. This instrument can be used to investigate the current activity profile of both <b>home</b> <b>nurses,</b> and auxiliary nurses or healthcare assistants in <b>home</b> <b>nursing.</b> This would provide important information for managers and policymakers to profile the activities of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and healthcare assistants and to proactively anticipate to the fast evolving needs of <b>home</b> <b>nursing.</b> In chapter 7 the 24 -hour recall instrument for <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> was used by 2478 <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and 277 healthcare assistants. The activity profile of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and healthcare assistants was mainly characterized by self-care facilitation activities. In the combination of data, the activities from the category "self-care facilitation" were mainly performed in combination with other activities related to the categories "Other care", "Administration", and "Psychosocial care" for the home nurses; and "Other care", "Administration", and "Communication" for the healthcare assistants. This study is an important first step in the identification of what it is that <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and healthcare assistants do in homecare, using a validated and reliable measurement instrument for <b>home</b> <b>nursing.</b> Conclusion The ultimate aim of this dissertation was to help and to support <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> to cope with the unfolding evolutions and trends by exploring the current and future role of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in the perspective of the retention of <b>home</b> <b>nurses,</b> task shifting and task purification. We can conclude that <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> have a positive professional self-image. This is an important foundation to cope with the existing imbalance and to retain the nurses in homecare. Furthermore, healthcare assistants were integrated in <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> to maintain and improve the efficacy of <b>home</b> <b>nursing.</b> The fact that healthcare assistants take care of a group of patients that does not have a specific nursing indication or nursing need, is an important step in the support of this idea. However, further research is necessary to gain evidence for this statement. Finally, the use of a validated and reliable measurement instrument for <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> (the 24 -hour recall instrument for <b>home</b> <b>nursing)</b> highlighted that the activity profile of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> is mainly characterized by self-care facilitation activities in combination with more intellectual activities. However, further research is necessary to explore if the integration of healthcare assistants in <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> shifted more complex (holistic) care situations to the <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> and more simple hygiene care situations to the healthcare assistants. nrpages: 166 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aims. To explore {{attitudes and}} {{confidence}} in professional competence of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> concerning depression and to evaluate the capacity of a minimal intervention in helping <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> detect depression in patients and their family caregivers. Background. Chronically ill patients have an elevated risk to develop comorbid depression, as do their family caregivers. However, most primary care providers have little training to detect patients at risk. A minimal intervention to help <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> detect symptoms of depression was therefore evaluated. Design. Quasi-experimental field study with pre, post and follow-up measures. Methods. In this study conducted from the fall of 2012 until the spring of 2013, <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> (N= 92) in three regions in Antwerp (Belgium) were assigned to a one hour intervention (consisting of information, skill training and discussion; N= 63) or to a control condition (N= 29). The Depression Attitude Questionnaire and the Morris Confidence Scale were completed before the intervention and three and seven months afterwards. For three months the number of detections in each region was monitored. Findings. No significant changes were found in attitude or confidence in professional competences, except for {{a decline in the}} role attitude for <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in the intervention group. <b>Home</b> <b>nurses</b> who followed the intervention did detect significantly more depressed compared to controls.

(2) What are parent expectations of <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> care? In-depth, semi-structured interviews were used to elicit full and clear descriptions of ideal <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> care from parents of technology dependent children currently receiving <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> care. ^ Four interviews were conducted with three couples and one mother from four families. Within-case analysis of the interview transcripts focused on parent descriptions of ideal <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> care. Narrative descriptions of ideal <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> care were prepared and submitted to the participants for review. Cross-case analysis of interview data focused on parent expectations. Parent discussed their expectations of nurses and for the care provided for their child as well as their expectations of the case managers who facilitate that direct care. Examination of the data regarding direct nursing care interventions revealed 61 codes that described helpful or supportive nursing interventions and ways of intervening. These codes fell into four areas: (1) exhibiting competence in technical, assessment, clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills, (2) exhibiting a caring manner, (3) relinquishing control of the child 2 ̆ 7 s care to the parents, and (4) fitting in with the family and their routines. ^ The study findings have significance for the practice of <b>home</b> care <b>nursing.</b> <b>Home</b> care <b>nurses,</b> particularly case managers, can incorporate the study findings into their practice, facilitating a good fit between nurses and families and planning a practice is individualized to meet the unique needs of each child and family. ...|$|R
