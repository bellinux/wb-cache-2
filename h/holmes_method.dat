The conclusion he drew in his essay entitled [...] "Sherlock Holmes and the case of Dr Freud", where he compared the Sherlock <b>Holmes</b> <b>method</b> of drawing sweeping inferences from trivial clues with Freud's analytic method for examining the human mind, was that {{in both cases the}} method is viewed as essentially intuitive and devoid of logic. He coined the term neologism [...] "mythod" [...] to describe their method embedded in a myth, devoid of scientific value. Although he conceded reluctantly that psychoanalysis might still have some value as an arching metaphor, he demolished psychoanalysis as a scientific discipline.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I analyze detective Sherlock <b>Holmes</b> <b>method</b> {{based on the}} {{semiotics}} of Ch. S. Peirce. I would like to show that although Holmes detective about his method claim that it is deductive, in-depth analysis shows that this method is far more complex and involves induction and abduction, and {{that each of these}} methods has its own importance in the detective's reasoning. The work is divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the Sherlock Holmes detective in terms of logical methods. The second part is focused on methods of reasoning by Ch. S. Peirce emphasizing abduction, a hypothesis. The third part is practical and includes analysis of the process of detective Sherlock Holmes based on the thesis of Ch. S. Peirce, as outlined in the second part. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{reported in}} a lighting pole on an elevated bridge structure near Wellington {{raised the question of}} how to better design for and predict the fatigue life of lighting poles subject to wind induced fatigue. There have been concerns as to the reliability and currency of the methods commonly used in New Zealand. The paper therefore reviews current international design methods and describes the development of an improved fatigue design method for lighting poles in New Zealand. The new method uses fracture mechanics based crack growth formulations in conjunction with a modified J. D. <b>Holmes</b> <b>Method</b> for wind response analysis of the pole to varying wind speeds. Cumulative crack growth is calculated iteratively rather than using an S-N curve based Palmegran-Miner summation. Wind spectra used in the method are developed from long term meteorological records at representative locations. Software has been prepared to enable quick assessment of the expected fatigue life of lighting poles, and associated gear openings and holding down bolts The method and software has been calibrated with reference to full scale laboratory fatigue proof testing of representative base stubs and natural wind response testing of a 12 m high lighting pole...|$|E

5000|$|The {{two games}} in the series made {{extensive}} use of a location map, which allowed players quick, direct access to all game locations. While not the first computer detective game, The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes nonetheless advanced the genre through its use of the Sherlock <b>Holmes</b> investigative <b>methods,</b> from interviewing witnesses to lab analysis. The games introduced detailed environments and ambience sounds. The series features a relatively high degree of historic accuracy as it conjures up London of the late Victorian era.|$|R

30|$|The {{seawater}} {{samples were}} filtered through GF/F 0.7  μm glass filters, frozen, {{and stored in}} the freezer. The concentrations of nitrate (NO 3), nitrite (NO 2), phosphate (PO 4), and dissolved silicate (DSi) were measured with an auto-analyzer (QuAAtro, BL-Tech). The concentration of ammonium (NH 4) was measured with a fluorometer (Trilogy, Turner Design) with a CDOM/NH 4 module (Model 7200 - 041, Turner Design), using the ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) <b>method</b> (<b>Holmes</b> et al. 1999). In this study, we defined dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) as the sum of NO 3 and NO 2 because almost all the concentrations of NH 4 at the surface along the coastline were below the detection limit (0.1  μM). Dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIP) is defined as PO 4. The concentration of Chl-a on the GF/F filters was quantified with a calibrated fluorometer (Trilogy, Turner Design). The analytical errors were within 10 %, suggesting that the values analyzed were sufficiently accurate to draw conclusions from the data.|$|R

These claims raise a number of questions. Three questions, in particular, seem to recur among thoughtful readers: (1) Why does Holmes, leader of the revolt against formalism, place so much emphasis on the role of logical analysis in law? (2) If legal method is empirical, what is law 2 ̆ 2 empirical 2 ̆ 2 about? What are the facts or the data upon which an empirical science of law should be based? and (3) Under the predictive theory of law, what is it that a judge is supposed to do when (s) he decides a case?

30|$|We use a {{hierarchical}} Bayesian algorithm {{to fit the}} DDM to the participants’ data, providing {{an account of the}} choices made and the full distribution of response times at both the individual and population levels. For purposes of hierarchical DDM model fitting, we grouped all 19 pathologists (experienced and inexperienced) into a single medical population and all 37 novices into a single novice population. These two populations were fit independently. The (in)experienced medical participants were grouped together due to the practical limitations of hierarchical modeling; 9 and 10 participants in each subgroup, respectively, are insufficient to define {{a hierarchical}} population with the DDM. Given the high level of correlation between model parameters in this model, we utilize the differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo (DEMCMC) method (Turner & Sederberg, 2012) to carry out this Bayesian estimation. Since the DDM does not have an analytically tractable closed-form likelihood function, we utilize a recently developed approximation, the probability density approximation (PDA) <b>method</b> (<b>Holmes,</b> 2015; Holmes & Trueblood, 2017; Turner & Sederberg, 2014), to approximate the likelihood of each parameter set sampled.|$|R
