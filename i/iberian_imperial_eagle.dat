50|$|The Spanish {{imperial}} eagle (Aquila adalberti), {{also known as}} the <b>Iberian</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle,</b> Spanish eagle, or Adalbert's eagle, is a threatened species of eagle native to the Iberian Peninsula. The binomial commemorates Prince Adalbert of Bavaria.|$|E
50|$|In {{southern}} Europe, {{the scarcity}} of rabbits threatens the conservation of predator species higher up the food chain that are endangered and depend on small-game such as rabbits. These include the Iberian lynx and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle.</b> For that reason biological warfare in Australia is a serious concern for conservation experts working {{in other parts of}} the world where the preservation of a viable rabbit population is problematic.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, the Spanish <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> was {{considered}} to be a subspecies of the eastern <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle,</b> but is now widely recognised as a separate species due to differences in morphology, ecology, and molecular characteristics.|$|R
2500|$|After {{selling his}} furs in China, Barkley {{acquired}} a new cargo and sailed <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle</b> {{to the island}} of Mauritius, then a French colony. While at Macau the ship's Austrian disguise was changed to Portuguese, and <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle</b> sailed to Mauritius under the flag of Portugal. Barkley was planning to sail to Calcutta, India, and outfit the ship for the second of three projected fur-trading voyages to the Pacific Northwest. In Mauritius {{he learned that the}} East India Company was taking legal action against the owners of <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle</b> for operating without a license. The various owners of the ship, including John Meares, decided to avoid trouble by breaking their ten-year contract with Barkley and selling <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle.</b> The partners managed to avoid blame and liability by leaving Barkley to take all responsibility. Charles and Frances Barkley stayed in Mauritius for over a year, during which time Frances gave birth to their first child. Eventually, in 1788, they sailed to Calcutta, India, where <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle</b> was confiscated.|$|R

50|$|He has {{published}} a dozen books on wildlife and nature and environmental issues. His latest book, La llamada del Puma (2015) with texts by Meritxell Margarit shows a journey {{of more than a}} year across all continents in search of wild animals with his family. In 2014, is published Sleeping amongst Wolves about the Iberian wolf in the wild. Before, in 2013, he published Looking for Fochas, which shows a year of observation with his son in the lake of Banyoles where he lives with his family. Among his previous works, La Mirada Salvaje-Encounters with the Iberian fauna stands out. This book gathers more than a hundred animals photographed in freedom in their Iberian habitats and narrates in first person the encounters with the most representative species. Other books of the author are: The <b>Iberian</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle,</b> The Cantabrian Bear, Viaje Soñado, Aether and Planet Football. Many of his books have been translated into several languages.|$|E
50|$|The municipality’s oldest {{coat of arms}} bore an <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagle</b> on {{a golden}} field.

50|$|The eastern <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> (Aquila heliaca) {{is a large}} {{species of}} bird of prey that breeds from southeastern Europe to western and central Asia. Most populations are migratory and winter in northeastern Africa and {{southern}} and eastern Asia. The Spanish <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> found in Spain and Portugal, was formerly lumped with this species, the name <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> being used in both circumstances. However, the two are now regarded as separate species due to significant differences in morphology, ecology and molecular characteristics.|$|R
