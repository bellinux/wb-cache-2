5|$|In {{countries}} where FGM is common, the practice's many variants {{are reflected in}} dozens of terms, often alluding to purification. In the Bambara language, spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as bolokoli ("washing your hands") and in the Igbo language in eastern Nigeria as isa aru or iwu aru ("having your bath"). A common Arabic term for purification has the root t-h-r, used <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> circumcision (tahur and tahara). It is also known in Arabic as khafḍ or khifaḍ.|$|E

5|$|The {{prisoner}} reformer John Howard {{reported in}} 1777 that the gaol was very small, forming a main room with three separate cages running along one side; {{one of these}} cages was reserved for female prisoners. The upper room {{was used as a}} chapel, and food for the inmates was lowered through a hole by the prison gaoler. In 1779, after complaints were made by about the conditions, £500 was granted by Parliament and the gaol was enlarged to comprise a day room and a total of seven cells <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> prisoners, with accommodation for the prison governor on the first floor. In exchange, the county agreed to take over the maintenance of the gaol. By 1795, Hugh Percy, the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, had become an important local landowner in the region and acquired the rights to the post of constable from the Duke of Cornwall, the then Prince George.|$|E
5|$|West Gate {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the city gaol, resulting in it surviving the destruction of the other city gates. When the reformer John Howard visited the gaol in the mid-1770s, he noted that it contained a large day room <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> prisoners and two small night rooms, but no courtyard for exercise. Prison reform became an important issue during the early 19th century, and the West Gate gaol was considered unsatisfactory, being condemned as dirty, cramped and insecure, resulting in the extension of the gaol into Pound Lane and the consequent dismantling of the adjacent city wall. There was a legal attempt to demolish the West Gate altogether in 1859, in order to allow the Wombwell Circus to march a parade of elephants into the city; the gatehouse was only saved by the casting vote of Canterbury's mayor. In 1865 the prison was closed and the West Gate became used first for the storage of archives and then as a museum.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} the {{psychological}} propensities <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> entrepreneurs are more similar than different. Empirical studies suggest that female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities. Asa Hansson, who looked at empirical evidence from Sweden, found that the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but increases with age for men. She also found that marriage increased {{the probability of a}} person becoming an entrepreneur.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{roles and}} {{stereotypes}} in society {{are reflected in}} a different experience <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> models, and different responses when those not in the arts learn that someone is a nude model. However, {{both male and female}} models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons. Attitudes toward male nudity, issues of homosexuality when male artists work from male models, and some bias towards the female form in art may lead to less opportunity for male models, and works of art that include male nudity are much less marketable. However, historically this has not been the case (See below).|$|E

25|$|Writing {{systems are}} {{distinguished}} from other possible symbolic communication systems in that a writing system is always associated {{with at least}} one spoken language. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as contour lines, are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female,</b> are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as numerals and the ampersand, are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} season, the {{workshop}} stage {{consisted of three}} rounds each <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> contestants. There were 28 contestants that {{made it to the}} workshop stage on the third season. In the first week, eight contestants (four males and four females) were sent home. Six contestants (three males and three females) were sent home in the second week, and the final workshop eliminated four more contestants (two males and two females). Before the spectacular round, pre-gala and wild card show was held. Four of the eliminated contestants were chosen by the judges and two of them, one male and one female, were given a place in the Spectacular Show based on voting result.|$|E
25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E

It {{also serves as a}} grievance redressal cell for complaints of sexual harassment. First aid centres are also available in the college general office and the counselling centre. The college undertakes a number of welfare measures for students and staff including provision of insurance coverage. The college has also set up a Grievance Redressal Cell with a representative from a Non-governmental Organization (NGO).|$|E
25|$|A {{family name}} is {{typically}} {{a part of}} a person's personal name which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal. In many countries, it is common for ordinary people to have only one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. Also, in most Slavic countries, in Greece and Iceland, for example, there are different family name forms <b>for</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.|$|E
