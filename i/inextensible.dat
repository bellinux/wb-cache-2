50|$|Mochi's {{characteristic}} chewiness {{is due to}} the polysaccharides in it.

50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} carcass plies of cords laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the tread. Without a belt, the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being <b>inextensible,</b> prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through vulcanisation. The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its flatter profile even when the tyre was inflated.|$|E
5000|$|The GHOST design {{explored}} the performance a superpressure balloon with a spherical two-layer PET film envelope holding the gas inside {{at a higher}} pressure than the surrounding atmosphere, allowing it to maintain a nearly constant altitude. These gas balloons float at a constant density altitude, where the balloon displaces a mass of air equal to its own mass. Expansion of the lifting gas due to solar heating, as in a zero-pressure balloon, is avoided in a superpressure balloon. The <b>inextensible</b> PET film allows the pressure to rise as the gas is heated, rather than allow the volume to expand. This allows them to drift with, and track, horizontal atmospheric air currents at a constant air pressure level (a constant altitude) above the Earth's surface.|$|E
50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial cord plies are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The <b>inextensible</b> belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|E
