40|$|The {{so-called}} {{second generation}} P 2 P file-sharing applications have with {{no doubt a}} better performance than the first implementations. The most remarkable difference {{is due to the}} <b>file</b> <b>division</b> into smaller pieces, where a receiving peer of any piece automatically becomes a new source to other peers. But a new question arises on how we distribute all the pieces provided by a seed peer to minimize the global and presumably individual download times. In this paper we summarize part of the work we have developed up until now to answer this general question, in particular, we will analyze how close the present second generation P 2 P file-sharing applications remain from an ideal solution with the theoretical best performance, that is, where all peers are interconnected with each other and all peers have an altruistic behavior always uploading its contents at any chance. Successive modifications of the ideal solution will lead us to more realistic scenarios. We will estimate the performance on each case and finally present the current studies we are carrying out to improve the overall capacity...|$|E
40|$|Crown {{witness is}} {{often found in}} {{criminal}} offense cases where the cases are inclusions and within them, splitsing or a case <b>file</b> <b>division</b> mechanism happens. The position of a crown witness is not explained explicitly in the criminal code procedure (KUHAP) and considering {{that it is an}} important instrument in criminal justice system enforcement, this paper will review how law position before a crown witness in criminal justice system. This final project uses normative law study and the data source was obtained from primary law materials viz. related constitutions, secondary law materials namely theories and literature and also tertiary law materials or Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia. The standard used to measure the problems in this research project is whether the position of a crown witness is valid in criminal justice system or not. This paper was done by secondary data-based approach and was followed by reviewing the interview results as supporting data. The result from this paper shows that in a criminal justice system, the position of a crown witness is legal according to the law based on certain principles viz. inclusion characteristic and the lack of evidence in a case which is done by splitsing or a case division file mechanism. Based on this result, the author of this paper suggests that to support the implementation of ‘fair trial’ principles, the exertion of the crown witness needs to be reconsidered because it is against the essence as a suspect in regards to fulfill the basic rights of a suspect and the position of a crown witness should be clearly and explicitly defined in criminal code procedure bills...|$|E
