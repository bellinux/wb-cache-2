5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of <b>ergotism</b> (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E

The donors are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and <b>ergotism,</b> known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E
5|$|The Great Famine of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal <b>ergotism,</b> a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing famine, and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated. Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade. Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{alkaloids}} {{can pass}} through lactation from mother to child, causing <b>ergotism</b> in infants.|$|E
25|$|Spanos and Gottlieb also {{state that}} ergot {{poisoning}} has additional symptoms {{not associated with}} the events in Salem, and {{that the proportion of}} children afflicted was less than in a typical <b>ergotism</b> epidemic. Anthropologist H. Sidky noted that <b>ergotism</b> had been known for centuries before the Salem witch trials, and argued that its symptoms would have been recognizable {{during the time of the}} Salem witch trials.|$|E
25|$|Historically, eating grain products, {{particularly}} rye, {{contaminated with}} the fungus Claviceps purpurea {{was the cause}} of <b>ergotism.</b>|$|E

25|$|When milled, the ergot {{is reduced}} to a red powder, obvious in lighter grasses but easy to miss in dark rye flour. In less wealthy countries, <b>ergotism</b> still occurs; an {{outbreak}} in Ethiopia occurred in mid-2001 from contaminated barley.

25|$|Numerous {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear {{whether it was a}} real illness or a social phenomenon. One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from ergot poisoning, which was known as St. Anthony's fire in the Middle Ages. During floods and damp periods, ergots were able to grow and affect rye and other crops. <b>Ergotism</b> can cause hallucinations and convulsions, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{symptoms}} of those who claimed affliction {{continues to be a}} subject of interest. Various medical and psychological explanations for the observed symptoms have been explored by researchers, including psychological hysteria in response to Indian attacks, convulsive <b>ergotism</b> caused by eating rye bread made from grain infected by the fungus Claviceps purpurea (a natural substance from which LSD is derived), an epidemic of bird-borne encephalitis lethargica, and sleep paralysis to explain the nocturnal attacks alleged by some of the accusers. Some modern historians are less inclined to focus on biological explanations, preferring instead to explore motivations such as jealousy, spite, and a need for attention to explain the behavior.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of <b>ergotism</b> among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.|$|E
500|$|Having reigned {{for less}} than three years, Magnus became ill and died in Nidaros (Trondheim) on 28 April 1069. The sagas posit that Magnus died of ringworm, but modern {{scholars}} have proposed that he instead may have died of <b>ergotism</b> (poisoning by the Claviceps purpurea fungus). Snorri Sturluson writes briefly in the Saga of Harald Hardrade that Magnus was [...] "an amiable king and bewailed by the people." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the fly agaric and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose sclerotia appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by <b>ergotism,</b> with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with ergot, which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 it {{was pointed}} out that ergots {{produced}} by different strains of Claviceps purpurea, and those growing in different soils, may produce different ergot alkaloid compositions. [...] This may explain the different manifestations of <b>ergotism</b> in different outbreaks. For example, an alkaloid present in high concentrations in ergots from Europe east of the Rhine may have caused convulsive <b>ergotism,</b> while ergot from the west caused epidemics of gangrenous <b>ergotism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Epidemics of {{the disease}} were {{identified}} throughout history, though the references in classical writings are inconclusive. Rye, the main vector (route) for transmitting <b>ergotism,</b> was not grown much around the Mediterranean. When Fuchs in 1834 separated references to <b>ergotism</b> from erysipelas and other afflictions, he found the earliest reference to <b>ergotism</b> in the Annales Xantenses for the year 857: [...] "a great plague of swollen blisters consumed the people by a loathsome rot, so that their limbs were loosened and fell off before death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Specific pilgrimages {{were also}} held in {{response}} to outbreaks of disease. When <b>ergotism</b> (more popularly known in the Middle Ages as [...] "St. Anthony's fire") afflicted many victims, the crypt of the original church became a hospital {{to care for the}} sick.|$|E
2500|$|In the Middle Ages, the gangrenous {{poisoning}} {{was known}} as [...] "holy fire" [...] or [...] "Saint Anthony's fire", named after monks of the Order of St. Anthony who were particularly successful at treating this ailment. According to Snorri Sturluson, in his Heimskringla, King Magnus, son of King Harald Sigurtharson, who was the half-brother of Saint King Olaf Haraldsson, died from <b>ergotism</b> shortly after the Battle of Hastings. The 12th century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois recorded the mysterious outbreaks in the Limousin region of France, where the gangrenous form of <b>ergotism</b> {{was associated with the}} local Saint Martial. Likewise, an outbreak in Paris ca. 1129 was reported to be cured by the relics of Saint Genevieve, a miracle commemorated in the November 26 [...] "Feast of the Burning Ones".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ergotism</b> (pron. [...] ) is {{the effect}} of {{long-term}} ergot poisoning, traditionally due to the ingestion of the alkaloids produced by the Claviceps purpurea fungus that infects rye and other cereals, and more recently by the action of a number of ergoline-based drugs. It is also known as ergotoxicosis, ergot poisoning and Saint Anthony's Fire. Ergot poisoning is a proposed explanation of bewitchment.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{epidemics}} of <b>ergotism</b> occurred up {{into the}} 19th century. Fewer outbreaks have occurred since then due to rye being carefully monitored in developed countries. [...] A severe outbreak of something akin to ergot poisoning occurred, however, in the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951, resulting in five deaths. The outbreak, and the diagnostic confusion surrounding it, are vividly described in John Grant Fuller's book The Day of St Anthony's Fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that <b>ergotism</b> could explain cases of bewitchment has {{been subject to}} debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael's article, historians Spanos and Gottlieb argued against the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb's rebuttal to Caporael's article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation. For example, they argued that, if the food supply was contaminated, the symptoms would have occurred by household, not individual. However, historian Leon Harrier said that even if supplies were properly cooked, residents suffering from stomach ulcers had a risk of absorbing the toxin through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the bloodstream. Being similar to Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ergot would not survive in the acidic environment of a typical human's stomach, especially in properly cooked food. [...] But if some but not all residents were malnourished and suffering from bleeding stomach ulcers, only they could be affected by ingesting contaminated grains, leaving the majority unaffected, explaining why <b>ergotism</b> was not previously recognized. [...] Harrier argued that the numbers could have been larger, possibly including the entire town, but due to the trials on bewitchment and heresy, {{and the fear of}} being accused and subsequently executed, few could come forward while suffering from legitimate medical conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{had been}} {{secretly}} buried on the mountain-top {{where he had}} chosen to live. His remains were reportedly discovered in 361, and transferred to Alexandria. Some time later, they were taken from Alexandria to Constantinople, {{so that they might}} escape the destruction being perpetrated by invading Saracens. In the eleventh century, the Byzantine emperor gave them to the French Count Jocelin. Jocelin had them transferred to La-Motte-Saint-Didier, which was then renamed Saint-Antoine-en-Dauphiné. There, Anthony is credited with assisting in a number of miraculous healings, primarily from <b>ergotism,</b> which became known as [...] "St. Anthony's Fire". He was credited by two local noblemen of assisting them in recovery from the disease. They then founded the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony in honor of him, who specialized in nursing the victims of skin diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Poisonings due to {{consumption}} of seeds treated with mercury compounds are sometimes misidentified as <b>ergotism.</b> Simon Cotton of the Chemistry Department of Uppingham School, UK {{said that there}} have been numerous cases of mass-poisoning due {{to consumption}} of mercury-treated seeds.H5HgCl and C6H5HgOCOCH3) for food, caused the poisoning of about 100 people in West Pakistan in 1961. Another outbreak happened in Guatemala in 1965. Most serious was the disaster in Iraq in 1971–2, when according to official figures 459 died.

2500|$|Pope Urban II {{planned the}} {{departure}} of the crusade for 15 August 1096; a number of unexpected bands of peasants and low-ranking knights organized and set off for Jerusalem on their own. The peasant population had been afflicted by drought, famine, and disease for many years before 1096, and some of them seem to have envisioned the crusade as an escape from these hardships. Spurring them on had been a number of meteorological occurrences beginning in 1095 that seemed to be a divine blessing for the movement: a meteor shower, aurorae, a lunar eclipse, and a comet, among other events. An outbreak of <b>ergotism</b> had also occurred just before the Council of Clermont. Millenarianism, the belief {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, popular in the early 11th century, experienced a resurgence in popularity. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban might have expected a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 100,000 Crusaders of mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children.|$|E
