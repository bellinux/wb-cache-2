It was in Scotland {{that he learned}} {{of the death of}} his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath {{that he had come}} with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E

5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} {{could no longer be}} funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively– when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E
5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision – {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother 'Please accept from me a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valparaíso, where letters {{informed}} Roger {{that his}} father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May. In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, John Moore. In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago. Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where he took a long hunting trip. By the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico. The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship, the Bella, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E
5|$|To {{help him}} in tackle the {{numerous}} challenging tasks he faced in Malayan Sugar then, his future wife, Judy Hwang, gave him some notes of her translation of Sun Tzu's Art of War from Chinese to English, as he is not conversant in Chinese. Khoo immediately took keen interest in the military treatise and began to learn and apply Sun Tzu's teachings into his work. Throughout his professional career, Sun Tzu's Art of War was his indispensable guide. Khoo married Judy, a former Taiwanese singer in early 1982. In 1983, he moved to Kuala Lumpur as sales and marketing manager. When Asian sugar baron Robert Kuok was invited to turn around the ailing Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1987, Khoo joined them as administration manager at Magnum Corporation. In 1989, he left Magnum to head the personnel and administration department of Metroplex Holdings Berhad, where he later became the general manager within just four months, managing The Mall shopping complex. Khoo initiated a series of management and sales policies that enabled The Mall to secure the 'Best Shopping Mall' award {{for two years in}} a row. In the same year, he began writing his first best-seller; War at Work – Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today's Business World, which was a collection of memoranda based on Sun Tzu's Art of War <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> managers at The Mall.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs {{himself was}} very displeased {{with the first}} edition {{and this was the}} main reason for {{rewriting}} it so thoroughly: in 1961 <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Allen Ginsberg that he rewrote it extensively while he was working on Dead Fingers Talk, mostly because he was displeased with the balance of cut-up and more linear material. However, his revised editions included much new cut-up material as well as more conventional prose.|$|E
