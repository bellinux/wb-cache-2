5|$|Several {{stations}} {{proposed for}} the DART Light Rail network are classified as <b>deferred.</b> As defined by DART, a <b>deferred</b> station {{is one that has}} been identified, but will not be constructed until land use changes warrant the construction of a station. In addition to the <b>deferred</b> stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station. The underground station was excavated {{at the time of the}} original construction of the Red and Blue Lines, only to have plans subsequently scrapped due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to <b>deferred</b> gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for <b>deferred</b> gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} online {{adjustment}} method {{to discover the}} latest <b>defer</b> time for each job using Fixed Priority scheduling algorithm. By <b>deferring</b> the preemption of lower priority jobs by higher priority jobs until the latest <b>defer</b> time, we reduce the overhead caused by preemptions while still ensuring every job meets its deadline. We present our ongoing work which modifies dual priority of Fixed-Priority scheduling using the worst case response time. Thus we find each task’s latest <b>defer</b> time by subtracting its deadline from its worst case response time offline. Then for each job’s release time, we adjust the latest <b>defer</b> time online. In this manner, we can then reduce certain amount of preemptions hence reduce the overhead. 1...|$|R

40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice, people can {{normally}} select no option, i. e., <b>defer</b> choice. Previous research has investigated when and why individuals <b>defer</b> choice, but has almost never looked at these questions when groups of people make choices. Separate reasons predict that groups may be equally likely, more likely, or less likely than individuals to <b>defer</b> choice. We re-analyzed some previously published data and conducted a new experiment to address this question. We found that small groups of people tended to <b>defer</b> choice more often than their members would. Assuming that the groups used a plurality rule but gave additional weight to individual preferences to <b>defer</b> choice allowed the groups' responses to be predicted quite well. We discuss several possible explanations of these findings. group decision making, choice deferral, decision avoidance, decision delay. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{viviparous}} lizards to <b>defer</b> parturition {{after completion of}} embryonic development is a potentially key strategy for enhancing offspring fitness. Using the spotted snow skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, we investigated the ability of females to <b>defer</b> birth if placed into cold conditions at the same time, for 1, 2 or 3 weeks {{at the end of}} gestation. The ability to <b>defer</b> birth was compared between two populations {{at each end of the}} species’ altitudinal range. We hypothesized that females from the high elevation population would be less likely to <b>defer</b> parturition under extended periods of poor conditions, thus ensuring that young were not born too late in the season. In all but the 3 - week treatment group from the high elevation population, females were able to <b>defer</b> birth when placed under cold conditions: for all groups, there was no treatment effect on offspring phenotype at birth, dispersal distance or survivorship after release. However, there was a significant negative effect of treatment on offspring growth measured after release, with the results differing between the populations. Females from the high elevation population were less able to <b>defer</b> birth under long periods (3 weeks) of cold conditions, and this was accompanied by a decrease in viability of the offspring...|$|R

5|$|Delayed gratification, or <b>deferred</b> gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an {{immediate}} reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
