A secondary aim was to evaluate the ratings of perceived exertion and fatigue index in response to different exercise order. On separate testing days, twelve resistance-trained men, aged 23. 0 ± 4. 3 years, height 174. 8 ± 6. 75 cm, body mass 77. 8 ± 13. 27 kg, body fat 12. 0 % ± 4. 7 %, were submitted to a super-set method by using two different exercise orders: quadriceps (leg extension) + hamstrings (leg curl) (QH) or hamstrings (leg curl) + quadriceps (leg extension) (HQ). Sessions consisted of three sets with a ten-repetition maximum load with 90 seconds rest between sets. Results revealed that the total training volume was higher for the <b>HQ</b> exercise <b>order</b> (P = 0. 02) with lower perceived exertion than the inverse order (P = 0. 04).
