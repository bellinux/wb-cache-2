5000|$|On November 1, the {{day after}} the Breeders' Cup, Wohlers, acting as racing manager for McIngvale, {{dismissed}} Borell from her position as the colt's trainer. Wohlers claimed the decision had been made prior to the Breeders' Cup. Borell claimed however, that she had been dismissed because she refused Wohlers' request to send the colt to the track for exercise after finding heat and mild swelling in one of his legs. The ensuing debate between the parties initially played out largely on social media for several days until Borell filed suit against McIngvale on November 10, 2015, alleging breach of contract and defamation. [...] While Borell initially named Keeneland in her suit, requesting that the track <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> a portion of the purse money that was claimed in the lawsuit, The Fayette County Circuit Court held that the court could not order Keeneland to do so.|$|E
50|$|Source code escrow agents hold {{source code}} of {{software}} in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally {{you do not}} own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, {{under the terms of}} a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an escrow agreement in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party - an escrow agent - on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proactive}} {{alternative to}} key disclosure law is key escrow law, {{where the government}} <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> a copy of all cryptographic keys in use, but is only permitted to use them if an appropriate warrant is issued. Key escrow systems face difficult technical issues and are subject {{to many of the}} same criticisms as key disclosure law; they avoid some issues like lost keys, while introducing new issues such as the risk of accidental disclosure of large numbers of keys, theft of the keys by hackers or abuse of power by government employees with access to the keys. It would also be nearly impossible to prevent the government from secretly using the key database to aid mass surveillance efforts such as those exposed by Edward Snowden. [...] The ambiguous term key recovery is applied to both types of systems.|$|R
50|$|Members each {{contribute}} to the operating expense of the trust, and <b>hold</b> funds <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> {{for the purchase of}} patents. Each member's escrow funds are used for the purchase of only those patents that they are interested in. The members involved in the purchase are then licensed to the patents. After a certain period of time, the patents are sold or donated. This is known as a catch and release strategy. AST does not litigate.|$|R
50|$|Berkley {{announced}} in June 2012 {{that she would}} turn over all $11,900 in campaign contributions from indicted lobbyist Harvery Whittemore to the U.S. Treasury.

50|$|In 1993 {{he became}} United States Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and in 1996 was {{assigned}} the additional job of White House Special Envoy for Cryptography. At the OECD he successfully negotiated the Convention to Prohibit Bribery in International Business Transactions. As Special Envoy for Cryptography, Aaron {{pushed for a}} global standard that would require computer users with high grade encryption to submit keys to their codes for scrambling data to an independent authority, which would <b>hold</b> them <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> and make them available to law enforcement only under a court order. At the time, he argued that unbreakable codes {{in the hands of}} terrorists would threaten every country's security. However, he was attacked by advocates of privacy rights, who said that the compromise could easily be misused by Governments and corporations. In 1997 he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, where ironically he negotiated privacy rules with the European Union on the handling of personal data.|$|R
5000|$|On August 30, 2016, after {{a three-year}} investigation, the EU's {{competition}} commissioner concluded that Apple had received [...] "illegal state aid" [...] from Ireland. The Commission ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes. The Irish government [...] "unanimously" [...] agreed {{to appeal the}} ruling, claiming there was no departure from the applicable Irish taxation law and that the Commission's action was an intrusion into Irish sovereignty (since national taxation policy is excluded from Union treaties). Apple have also announced that they will appeal the Commission's findings. The EU Commission ruling required Ireland to collect the €13bn from Apple and to <b>hold</b> the funds <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> pending {{the outcome of the}} appeals by January 2017 and were criticised in May 2017 by the EU for taking too long in collecting the funds.|$|R
