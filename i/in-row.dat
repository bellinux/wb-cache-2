40|$|ABSTRACT. Producers in the Coastal Plain of {{the southeastern}} United States manage soil {{compaction}} in conservation tillage systems by <b>in‐row</b> subsoiling prior to planting. However, planting directly over the loosened zone of soil can be difficult in high‐residue conservation tillage systems where cover crop production is maximized, because the loosened soil is often covered by the large amounts of cover crop residue. Tractors equipped with guidance systems could assist with placement of <b>in‐row</b> subsoiling and planting operations, but {{little is known about}} the accuracy necessary to maximize rooting development, reduce succeeding soil compaction, and optimize crop yield. An experiment was conducted in south‐central Alabama to determine the maximum distance <b>in‐row</b> subsoiling performed by three different implements could be from the cotton row without reducing cotton growth and increasing soil compaction. Results showed that if the cotton row was within 5. 1 cm of <b>in‐row</b> subsoiling, the relative seed cotton yield is 44 % greater than a corresponding no‐subsoiling treatment.

40|$|Orchard floor {{management}} {{is vital to}} tree health, yield, and fruit quality. Current standard management practices include maintaining a vegetation-free tree row and a grass-covered alleyway. This system is effective at limiting competition from undesirable vegetation and creating a favorable environment for the fruit trees. However, limitations to standard orchard floor practices are that the grass alleyway provides no nutrient benefit, and current practices do not readily lend themselves to organic management constraints. Alternative <b>in-row</b> and alleyway systems are requisite to creating improved orchard {{floor management}} systems. Three different approaches were used to investigate alternative orchard floor management strategies, including: alternative <b>in-row</b> weed control with combinations of mulch and organic herbicides, alternative alleyway management with legume cover crops, and combinations of <b>in-row</b> and alleyway alternative strategies. Although organic <b>in-row</b> weed control was best accomplished with combinations of straw and acetic acid, this management approach was not economically viable at current costs of labor and supplies, and current fruit prices. Alfalfa and alfalfa clover treatments contributed the most aboveground biomass and nitrogen among alternative alleyway covers, but consumed 45 % more water than the conventional grass alleyway. In combinations of <b>in-row</b> and alleyway alternatives, birds-foot trefoil alleyway had a beneficial effect on tree growth compared to grass, while consuming {{the greatest amount of}} water. Peach yields were the highest for the integrated compost and NPK fertility treatments that used herbicides to minimize competition. Treatments that experienced the most competition from weeds, no herbicide and reduced herbicide treatments, resulted in lower yields. Weed fabric and tillage <b>in-row</b> weed control methods resulted in the highest tree growth as compared to the straw and alyssum treatments. Finally, results from the combined studies were integrated into a series of recommendations for commercial fruit growers. While alternatives to orchard floor management show a number of potential benefits for growers in the Intermountain West, additional work is needed to determine the long-term viability of these approaches...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{seedlings}} emerging {{with dry}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) or soon thereafter {{are a major}} problem because they interfere with crop growth and development more than later emerging weeds. Mechanical practices like between-row cultivation usually control weeds located away from crop plants, {{but one of the}} major concerns of dry bean producers is the growth of weeds located on the crop row. Dry bean yield reductions by weeds growing in the crop row may be avoided by timely control of weeds with rotary hoeing, <b>in-row</b> cultivation, and chemical methods. Field experiments were conducted in 1996 and 1997 to (1) evaluate the effect of mechanical cultivation, herbicides, and dry bean on weed seedling emergence; and (2) evaluate weed control and dry bean response to singular or combinations of rotary hoeing, <b>in-row</b> cultivation, and herbicides. Total weed emergence in 1996 and 1997 was similar in cropped and noncropped areas. Herbicides were more effective than mechanical cultivation in reducing weed emergence by 91 % in 1996 and 88 % in 1997. Initial weed seedling emergence was observed at about 120 TT units with 3 to 9 % cumulative emergence in 1996, while weed emergence was first observed at 80 TT units with 6 to 16 % cumulative emergence among treatments in 1997. In both years, there was a trend for weed emergence in the untreated control and rotary hoed plots to be 26 % on average lower in cropped areas than in noncropped areas implying a competitive effect by the dry bean crop. Although weed seedling emergence occurred throughout the growing season more weed seedlings emerged in June and early July than in late July and August. Therefore, these data support the importance of applying mechanical <b>in-row</b> weed control treatments early in the growing season when a majority of the weed seedlings are emerging. The effect of dry bean on weed emergence was accurately modeled by the Gompertz function, but models developed to predict weed emergence when rotary hoeing and <b>in-row</b> cultivation were used failed to accurately predict weed emergence. Dry bean stands were not reduced by rotary hoeing, <b>in-row</b> cultivation, and herbicides in 1996, but <b>in-row</b> cultivation reduced dry bean population by 21 % compared to rotary hoeing in 1997. Difference in dry bean yields between years was due to different weed densities. Weed density in 1996 was 35 plants/m 2 and in 1997 was 135 plants/m 2. The combination of EPTC plus ethalfluralin applied alone or combined with rotary hoeing or <b>in-row</b> cultivation had lower weed densities than dimethenamid or imazethapyr plus bentazon. Among herbicides, the group of treatments with dimethenamid had 23 and 53 % lower dry bean seed yields than the group of treatments with EPTC plus ethalfluralin that had the highest seed yields in 1996 and 1997, respectively. ...|$|E

Fruit quality was determined by measuring fruit weight, flesh firmness, peel color, soluble solid content, and titratable acidity. WIL produced more and more efficiently than CON, especially at closer spacings. WIL canopies were generally bigger than CON canopies, and reduced spacing penalized stem growth and influenced canopy conformation. Root growth and conformation was similar for both cultivars, whereas decreasing <b>in-row</b> spacing reduced root dry weight, length, volume, and spread area only in WIL. Also, WIL trees partitioned more to fruit and leaves compared to CON, and increasing spacing resulted in a relative shift toward vegetative growth.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the differences in soil bulk density and cone index resulting from the interactions of surface tillage, subsoiling, and controlled traffic in a long-term corn-soybean cropping system experiment in a Coastal Plain soil in the southeastern U. S. Traffic or no-traffic treatments were accomplished using an experimental wide-frame tractive vehicle (WFTV), which enabled operations without traffic on 6. 1 m wide growing zones. Subsoiling treatments included no subsoiling, annual <b>in-row</b> subsoiling, and initial one-time subsoiling on 25 cm centers to completely disrupt the soil to the 40 cm depth. Surface tillage treatments were no-tillage or disking and field cultivation. Soil measurements were taken after the treatments were imposed for five years.

Four significant conclusions from this study can be drawn: (1) vehicle traffic increased soil bulk density nearest the surface in all row positions, with the greatest increases occurring directly in the trafficked row position where equipment traffic was applied; (2) no-tillage caused significantly increased bulk density values near the soil surface in all three row positions; (3) annual <b>in-row</b> subsoiling effectively relieved soil compaction, while the initial complete disruption subsoiling treatment had similar bulk density and cone index values as the no-subsoiling treatment; and (4) <b>in-row</b> subsoiling also loosened th...|$|E

Treatments included two mulched treatments where mowed alleyway residue was transferred <b>in-row</b> at rates of 1 x and 3 x of alleyway biomass, one treatment where residue was incorporated into alleyways, one treatment where residue was removed, and one unplanted treatment. Vine growth, root growth, and nutritional status of young vines were measured over two growing seasons, as was soil moisture from 0 - 76 cm depth. Weed coverage was assessed visually and densities of broadleaf and grass weeds were determined. <b>In-row</b> volumetric and gravimetric soil moisture measured across 0 - 30 cm were greater in mulched than non-mulched treatments each year while the 3 x level of mulch treatment had greater soil moisture than the 1 x level of mulch treatment in 2010. Soil compaction <b>in-row</b> was lowest in mulched treatments each year. One-year old grapevines destructively harvested in fall each year had greater leaf and wood biomass in mulched treatments than non-mulched treatments. Shoot lengths were greater in mulched treatments than non-mulched treatments in 2010. Vines in mulched treatments had greater pruning weights by 43 % in 2010 than the treatment in which residue was removed. Clusters per shoot were greater in vines under the 3 x level of mulch in 2010. SPAD measures of leaf chlorophyll concentration were higher in mulched treatments than non-mulched treatments. Weed coverage and densities were substantially lower <b>in-row</b> of mulched treatments during 2009 and 2010, with nearly 100 % weed suppression by the greater level of residue mulch. Alleyway weed coverage was lowest when residue was incorporated, and highest in the unplanted treatment at some sampling dates. These results indicate that cover crops can be managed effectively to increase shoot and leaf growth of one- to three-year old V. vinifera 'Chardonnay' vines and conserve soil moisture in a non-irrigated, cool climate vineyard.

Deep zone tillage is one method that minimizes the width of soil disturbance to the planting row while providing sufficient disturbance to increase drainage and aeration and decrease compaction. This research addresses two constraints to an organic reduced tillage vegetable system: <b>in-row</b> weed control and fertility management. Two cover crop mixes, hairy vetch-rye or oats-peas were sown on two different dates at two different rates for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. Oat-pea cover crops were winter killed (leaving minimal residue) and hairy vetch-rye plots were flail mowed. Plots were then deep zone tilled, without incorporating cover crop biomass. Peppers were transplanted, and cover crop biomass in half the hairy vetch-rye plots was moved <b>in-row</b> to concentrate it, providing <b>in-row</b> weed control. Time required for cultivation and weeding by hand was recorded for economic analysis. Weed counts and biomass, pepper plant biomass, soil temperature, and soil N were monitored over the season. Planting cover crops earlier increased cover crop biomass significantly in 2009 but increasing seeding rates did not increase biomass either year. <b>In-row</b> mulch effectively decreased mid-season weed biomass. Hairy vetch-rye residue decreased soil temperatures both years, decreasing pepper plant size in these plots.

40|$|Abstract. A {{solution}} {{method is}} proposed for calculating wave scattering by a multiple-row array {{in which the}} rows are permitted to have different periodicities. Each individual row contains {{an infinite number of}} identical and equispaced scatterers, which can be solved through standard techniques by invoking periodicity. Previous studies have investigated the wave attenuation produced by multiple-row arrays but in which the periodicity in the rows is fixed. However, this leads to difficulties around the resonant points, at which the number of scattering angles produced by the rows changes. The method outlined in the present work involves a discretization of the directional spectrum. This is combined with a mapping of the individual rows onto neighboring geometries that fit into the discrete system so that, as the mesh is refined, the geometry converges to its intended form. The method is applied to a canonical problem in which a potential function exists in the two-dimensional plane exterior to an array composed of circular scatterers, which have a Neumann condition imposed on their boundaries. Forcing is provided by an incident wave. Wave attenuation is investigated in a numerical results section using ensemble averages in which the row spacings and <b>in-row</b> spacings are chosen from normal distributions. Convergence of the solutions with respect to the numerical method is established, and examples of the smoothing effects gained from incorporating variation in the <b>in-row</b> spacing are given...|$|E

However, soil CO 2 loss characteristic of different farm implements has not been adequately investigated. Our objectives were to compare implement-induced short-term CO 2 loss from soil (using two chamber systems) and to characterize spatial changes in CO 2 flux from zones of soil disturbance caused by these implements. Four-row implements were used on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols). The implements tested were two <b>in-row</b> subsoilers (a KMC-Kelly 7 Ripper and a Brown-Harden Ro-Till 7) and a Kinze 7 planter. Gas flux measurements were made with a large canopy chamber (over the center two rows) for an integrated assessment of equipment-induced soil disturbance; a small soil chamber system was also used to characterize positional effects (i. e., in the row and trafficked and untrafficked row middles) on soil CO 2 efflux. The small chamber system showed that trafficked areas exhibited lower CO 2 efflux relative to <b>in-row</b> and untrafficked row positions. Comparable CO 2 flux patterns were noted between the large canopy and small soil chamber systems (averaged over all positions). Results from this study suggest that both chamber systems could successfully characterize implement-induced flux patterns on loamy sand soils and that consideration should be given to selecting equipment that conserves soil resources...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ultimate}} goal of site-specific agriculture (SSA) is to optimise inputs for agronomic and environmental benefits. Soil and yield variability and their interaction with soil management practices are required to understand cause-effect relationships. However, these interactions have rarely been assessed at the landscape level. Our objective was to evaluate two years of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seed yield response to soil management practices and the interactions with terrain and soil attributes in a 10 ha field in the coastal plain of Alabama, USA. A soil survey, topography, and soil electrical conductivity (EC) maps were obtained to delineate management zones. Eight terrain attributes were derived from the digital elevation model. The field was divided into 496 cells of 20 x 6 -m; composite soil samples (30 cm depth) were collected and analysed for soil organic carbon (SOC) and texture. Four treatments were established in a {{randomised complete block design}} with six replicates in 6 m wide strips traversing the landscape in a corn (Zea mays L.) -cotton rotation. Treatments were a conventional system with (CTM) or without dairy bedding manure (CT), and a conservation system with (NTM) and without manure (NT). In CT and CTM, tillage consisted of chisel ploughing/disking + <b>in-row</b> subsoiling; no cover crop was used in winter. The NT and NTM consisted of no-tillage with non-inversion <b>in-row</b> subsoiling and winter cover crops. Yield wa...|$|E
40|$|Vinegar, {{an organic}} herbicide, can {{supplement}} the existing intra-row weed control options of organic farmers. However, {{there are two}} primary limitations to its use in vegetable crops. First, it is expensive. Second, vinegar applications that contact the crop can cause injury and yield loss. The aim {{of this research was}} to use vinegar to control intra-row weeds in bell pepper in a way that product costs would be reduced and crop injury would be minimized. Vinegar was banded <b>in-row</b> to reduce product volume and expense. Applications were shielded and directed below the crop canopy to minimize contact with crop foliage. Stem protectants, organic paints applied to crop stems, were included and evaluated as potential physical barriers to crop stem injury. A tractor mounted sprayer/cultivator was constructed to apply a 25 cm-wide band of vinegar at the base of two crop rows, while the inter-row areas were simultaneously cultivated. Two trials were conducted in transplanted bell pepper. A single application of 200 -grain vinegar (20 % acetic acid) at 700 L/ha was applied when weeds were in the cotyledon to six-leaf stage. Applications were made with the lower stems coated in one of two organic paints (linseed oil and clay-based) or left uncoated. Handweeded and weedy <b>in-row</b> treatments were included for comparison. One day after vinegar application, <b>in-row</b> weed control was 100 % in both pepper trials. Two weeks after application, there were 75 % fewer weeds germinating in the vinegar treated areas, as compared to the areas which were handweeded. With vinegar, there was minimal soil disturbance, so the potential to stimulate latent weed seed germination was significantly reduced. Neither stem paint prevented crop injury; the clay paint flaked off within 2 weeks while the linseed oil was phytotoxic. Despite pepper foliar injury of less than 5 %, stem injury by 2 weeks post-application contributed to a measurable reduction in yield. With vinegar, high levels of weed control, and the extended duration of that control relative to handweeding, could facilitate improved organic intra-row weed control. However, crop injury must be reliably reduced beyond the levels found in these studies. More research will be needed to assess the value of alternative stem protectant materials...|$|E
