He said Linkin Park was still making a concept record, stating in another interview with MTV, [...] "we might need to just make a record and still try to do a concept but {{figure out a way}} to do it without actually waiting another five or six years to put out a record, to try to pull off all the grandiose insanity we were thinking of doing. And we're doing that." [...] Bassist Dave [...] "Phoenix" [...] Farrell predicted the band's fans would be divided about A Thousand Suns, saying, [...] "We've known [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> and if fans were expecting Hybrid Theory or Meteora, they're going to be surprised.

500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 9, 2012, Sparks {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Billboard, that she had about seven songs set so far for her third album. Sparks stated [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from what my fans have heard before. [...] With (2009's) 'Battlefield' it was pop/rock {{and a little bit of}} pop/R, but I'm going for more of the R side now, so it's like R/pop instead of pop/R" [...] In an interview with MTV, Sparks confirmed she had recorded a duet with Jason Derulo and it would be on the album and could serve as a potential single. Sparks performed on VH1 Divas 2012 with fellow singers Miley Cyrus, Kelly Rowland and Ciara. The show premiered on December 16, 2012. Sparks joined singers Ledisi and Melanie Fiona in a tribute to Whitney Houston.|$|E

2500|$|In 1837, {{the czar}} gave Njegoš {{permission}} to visit Saint Petersburg, {{just as a}} severe famine began to affect Montenegro. Immediately, Njegoš sensed that his second visit to the Russian capital was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> than the first. He was not greeted as warmly {{as he had been}} in 1833 and the Russians used the opportunity to call him out on several instances of [...] "unmonkish" [...] behaviour, particularly his fondness for being in the company of women. Despite this, Russia increased its annual subsidy and provided wheat to Montenegro's famished citizens. While Montenegro's dependence on Russia often provided the impoverished statelet with desperately needed funding, it was geopolitically disastrous for the Montenegrins, as both the Ottomans and Austrians believed that Montenegrin access to the Adriatic would constitute de facto Russian penetration into the Mediterranean given the nature of Russo−Montenegrin relations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million {{towards the}} Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a [...] center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis {{spoke in a}} panel {{about the future of}} film, {{alongside}} friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, [...] "These guys are the same ones who have been saying that LPs sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. Film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire." [...] The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the Interactive Media Division, and Trojan Vision, USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.|$|E

[...] When Billboard previewed the album in January 2010, Ben-Yehuda Ayala said [...] "Lopez sings, talk-sings and broods (within pop reason) on the subject of love," [...] while Rap-Up said it is very much in keeping with the title, [...] "a love roller coaster, taking you through {{the ups and downs of}} a relationship." [...] Following her move to Island Def Jam, Lopez said she would still be pressing ahead with the album under the title Love?. [...] "I just feel like it's an endlessly fascinating topic that all my albums have been about. It's still very confusing to me and so I explore that on this album, probably more than my other albums." [...] She also revealed that her husband Marc Anthony initially disapproved of the title because he felt that it may imply that the couple were having marital problems. However in {{interviews with}} DJ Skee, she said [...] "love has always been a theme of my career and this record wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> The album has a lot of up-tempo, dancy, urban tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anselmo {{started his}} own record label called Housecore Records {{sometime}} in 2001. The name derived from Anselmo's home being described {{as more of a}} [...] "hang out" [...] where many local friends and musicians would stay and record music together. Housecore also features in tattoo form on Anselmo's arm (Anselmo's told fans via live webcam that it was his first and favourite tattoo). Anselmo's primary objective is to release much older unreleased material and material from his many side projects. After gaining permission from Pantera's label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia band mate Killjoy's label, Baphomet Records. The newly named [...] "Baphomet/Housecore Records" [...] secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated [...] "What you're going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> It's going to be a fresh approach. It's {{going to be a lot}} of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done. Each band that I'm involved in outside of Pantera is a way for me to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part of me. With Pantera it's only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera's very important in my life, but there's many other things that keep this boy here content". After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo's label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2000, Stern's last live {{radio show}} of the year, he {{announced}} the signing of his new contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations. Forbes estimated his new earnings ranged between $17 million and $20 million a year. Stern spoke at The Concert for New York City in October 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed {{in a similar fashion}} to his 1992 MTV Music Video Awards appearance. In November 2001, Stern's production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled Kane for CBS, originally intended to replace The Howard Stern Radio Show following its cancellation, with Ron Zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode. Its premise followed [...] "an oddball southern family and its strong-willed patriarch. The lead character's life is altered when his previously long-lost wife returns home to him and their group of eccentric children". The project was cancelled before the filming stage. In late 2002, Stern acquired the rights to the comedy films Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) and Porky's (1982) with Arclight Films. He expressed a wish to use a remake of the former as a launchpad for an unknown band. Under the deal, Stern was served as executive producer and was allowed to place [...] "Howard Stern Presents" [...] in the titles. He reasoned, [...] "If I say to ... my audience, this is 'Howard Stern Presents', it means something to them ... it's going to be crazy. It means that it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> and they know I'm not going to be giving them any schlock." [...] Development for Porky's came to a halt in 2011 following legal action regarding the ownership of the film's rights.|$|E
