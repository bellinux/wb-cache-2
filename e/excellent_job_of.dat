5|$|The major field {{operation}} of the fall was Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{the opening}} and ending themes, the entire musical score for Blood+ {{was the work of}} noted film score {{producer}} Hans Zimmer and noted composer Mark Mancina. Blood+ was the first anime project Mancina worked on, and afterward he stated that working on the project turned him into an anime fan. All of the opening and ending themes were created at Sony Music for the project, after the production team, headed by Yutaka Omatsu, presenting the project concept and Blood+ worldview. The opening and ending themes are performed by a variety of artists, including Hitomi Takahashi, Chitose Hajime, Hyde, Mika Nakashima, Angela Aki, Uverworld, Jinn, and K. In an interview with Production I.G staff, Omatsu noted that he felt Sony did an <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> providing music fitting for each season, as did the team of Zimmer and Mancina.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design {{ophthalmic}} lenses that correct peripheral refractive errors of human eyes along a meridian. We designed lenses with the tangential section of one surface based on a figured spheroid but figured in the tangential section only. The curvature of the sagittal section of this surface was adjusted separately. A merit function was used to modify these surfaces until the lenses had power errors that corrected the eye. Examples are presented of lenses that correct a schematic eye. They do <b>excellent</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>of</b> correcting the peripheral power errors of the eye and are relatively insensitive to small changes in fitting distance. We conclude that it is theoretically feasible to design lenses to correct peripheral refractive errors...|$|R

40|$|We present {{photometry}} and {{spectra of}} the large Kuiper belt object 2007 OR 10. The data show significant near-infrared absorption features due to water ice. While most objects in the Kuiper belt with water ice absorption this prominent have the optically neutral colors of water ice, 2007 OR 10 is among the reddest Kuiper belt objects known. One other large Kuiper belt object [...] Quaoar [...] has similar red coloring and water ice absorption, and it is hypothesized that the red coloration of this object is due to irradiation of the small amounts of methane able to be retained on Quaoar. 2007 OR 10, though warmer than Quaoar, is in a similar volatile retention because it is sufficiently larger that its stronger gravity can still retain methane. We propose, therefore, that the red coloration on 2007 OR 10 is also caused by the retention of small amounts of methane. Positive detection will require spectra of methane on 2007 OR 10 will require spectra with higher signal-to-noise. Models for volatile retention on Kuiper belt objects appear {{to continue to do}} an <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> reproducing all <b>of</b> the available observations...|$|R

500|$|Upon release, Jumping Flash! 2 {{received}} mostly positive reviews.

[...] He found that like the original, the game is far too easy, and in particular that the impressive visual presence of the bosses is lost when the player defeats them in a matter of seconds. However, he noted that the levels are much larger than the original's and include hidden bonuses, giving it greater longevity. Dan Hsu and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized that the game is more of an expansion pack of the original Jumping Flash! than a new game, while Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer applauded it for having much better graphics and larger levels than the original. IGN staff were impressed by the game's newly expanded worlds and the inclusion of bonus worlds, and noted that despite not significantly differing from the first Jumping Flash!, the game [...] "still delivers". Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded the game as among the top 120 games reviewed by the publication in 2000.|$|E
