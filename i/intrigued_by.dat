5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland, who was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the story because {{he had not seen}} many television episodes about vegetarianism. The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are unusual for The Simpsons in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most The Simpsons characters simply have black spots in the centers of their eyes.|$|E
5|$|During Murray's 1935 trip to Palestine, she {{had taken}} the {{opportunity}} to visit Petra in neighbouring Jordan. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order {{to carry out a}} small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra. Back in England, from 1934 to 1940, Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at Girton College, Cambridge, and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Hollis is {{very much}} aware of Black's {{reputation}} and eager to prove her worth as an investigator. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> Frank's abilities as an investigator, she strives to learn as much from him as she can, while Frank also learns to recognize her strengths as an FBI agent. The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then turned her back on him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E

5|$|Indian-American student Pranav Sivakumar {{was praised}} by the President {{in his speech}} at the event. President Obama recounted how Sivakumar was first <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> {{scientists}} at six-years-old, after reading about famous researchers in an encyclopedia. His parents cultivated his quest for knowledge by bringing him to lectures on astrophysics; {{he went on to}} become a two-time finalist at the Google Science Fair.

5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the {{viewpoints}} of the two. Loran's {{view was that}} Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> {{the sound of a}} kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E

5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E

5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the possibility of doing away {{with much of the}} complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. <b>Intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E

5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E

50|$|Capital for {{the company}} of £400,000 (estimated at one-quarter to one-third of the liquid wealth of Scotland) was raised solely in Scotland, due to <b>intrigue</b> <b>by</b> English merchants and the English {{government}} which prevented shares being sold in Amsterdam and Hamburg.

5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more <b>intrigued</b> <b>by</b> modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E
