We evaluated {{the generalizability of}} that claim with four studies comparing students of Asian heritage (AH) and European heritage (EH). Study I (N = 897) confirmed a substantially higher rate of self-reported shyness among AH students (68 %) than among EH students (44 %). In Study 2 (N = 309), the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> in self-reported shyness was substantially higher for classroom than for social situations. In Study 3 (N = 213), the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> was strong for cross-ethnicity socializing but nil for same-ethnicity socializing. In Study 4 (N = 250), a behavioral index-classroom participation-was recorded and coded. The observed <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> in participation rate showed a medium effect size comparable to the self-report difference. There was no <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference,</b> however, in the mean complexity and challengingness of the classroom participations or in final course grades. We conclude that the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> is maximal for classroom participation because the latter situation combines several key contributing factors to Asian shyness.

40|$|This article {{critically}} examines ‘everyday’ cosmopolitanist {{approaches to}} migrants’ social relationships {{to call for}} a more nuanced understanding of how ethnicity may inform cosmopolitan ties and aspirations. Research on migrants’ everyday cosmopolitanism tends to either focus on individuals’ engagement with <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference,</b> or highlight commonalities that unite people across ethnic boundaries, treating ethnicity as a coexisting form of identity or solidarity. This article challenges this divide, proposing a framework for a more systematic examination of how ethnicity may facilitate, fragment or fade in cosmopolitan encounters or aspirations, starting from migrants’ perspective. Using examples from empirical research with Romanians in London, and other studies of everyday cosmopolitanism, the analysis illustrates the multiple ways in which ethnicity may shape the development and management of cosmopolitan ties, beyond the celebration of <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> or recognition of persisting ethnic identities that predominate in extant research. Furthermore, it problematises the notion of ‘rooted’ cosmopolitanism, exposing some of the difficulties to achieve this in practice. Whilst expanding our understanding of ethnicity within cosmopolitan sociability, the article thus calls for further reflection on how different participants imagine and negotiate cosmopolitan ventures, <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> and boundaries, instead of assuming, as often done, that they can simply reconcile them...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on the {{writings}} of Rey Chow, I aim in this article to show, first, how the performance of <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> is {{played out in the}} Chinese artistic field, and, second, how the Chinese nation-state skilfully accommodates critical voices to buttress its global position. Chineseness has become a unique selling point, an ethnic trading card that lubricates the financial and ideological flows between the global art world, the Beijing cultural scene and the Chinese nation-state. The art district 798 serves as a key example for the recent emergence of creative industries in which <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> plays an important productive force. In the third part of this article, I will show how Hong Kong complicates this picture, given that any claim by Hong Kong artists to <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> is bound to be incomplete and impure. The work of Pak Sheung Chuen (Tozer Pak) constitutes a powerful critique on and explores artistic lines of flight out of the issue of Chineseness and its intricate links with an enchanted mode of global capitalism. It does so not by developing an artistic critique, which would after all be constitutive of capitalism itself, but by engaging in what I like to term a tactics of the banal and the mundane that are firmly located in the here and now. These tactics constitute, similar to Rey Chow's writing, a micropolitics that may help {{to move away from the}} overcoded language of ethnicity and Chineseness...|$|R

25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences.</b> For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E

40|$|As part of {{its attempt}} to {{understand}} ‘an apartheid of souls’, this volume is concerned to show how mission activity, particularly that of European-based churches with close links {{to the expansion of}} Dutch/Calvinist influence, may have nurtured the local construction of race or <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> in Indonesian and South African society. One well-known account of Christianity in South Africa shows how the interaction between mission and missionised produced a sharply dichotomised sense - experienced by the Tshidi Tswana as the contrast between setsivana and segoa - of difference between indigenous and imported culture. While this shows how processes devoted to undermining it may paradoxically strengthen a sense of cultural identity, what it does not yield is a sense of how Christianity, appropriated within Tswana and other African societies, furnished a means of marking internal distinctions of social class, dovetailing in unexpected ways with <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference.</b> It is such divisions - potently fusing class with ethnicity and having crucial implications for the ownership, reclaiming, and use of land - with which the present paper is concerned...|$|R

25|$|Marcus Garvey {{encouraged}} African {{people around}} the world to be proud of their race and to see beauty in their own kind. This form of Black nationalism later became known as Garveyism. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were one people and they would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Booker T. Washington, Martin Delany, and Henry McNeal Turner. Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, Booker T. Washington but unfortunately Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the United Negro Improvement Association otherwise known as the UNIA. Garvey's beliefs are articulated in The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey as well as Message To The People: The Course of African Philosophy.|$|E
