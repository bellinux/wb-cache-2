However, the Rose in the Fist refused to sign it <b>in,</b> <b>because</b> it did not explicitly include some issues, such as civil unions and LGBT rights. The platform has been criticised by the House of Freedoms because of its 281-page length.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that people {{were less likely to}} use formulaic {{language}} in general topics and domains they were more well-versed <b>in,</b> <b>because</b> they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms. To date, there is insufficient research done to say if fillers are a part of integral meaning, or if they are aspect of performance, but we can say that they are useful in facilitating information for the listener.|$|E

Mitsuki is a strong-willed girl who dislikes housework, a trait that sometimes put her into conflict with Kokoro.|$|E

60|$|He entered very softly; <b>in</b> part <b>because</b> {{it was a}} church; <b>in</b> part <b>because</b> his tread {{was always}} soft; <b>in</b> part <b>because</b> Tom played a solemn tune; <b>in</b> part <b>because</b> {{he thought he would}} {{surprise}} him when he stopped. Unbolting the door of the high pew of state, he glided in and shut it after him; then sitting in his usual place, and stretching out his legs upon the hassocks, he composed himself to listen to the music.|$|R
25|$|On 4 July, the 279-man Thai {{artillery}} battalion {{arrived at}} Muang Soui from Korat with one 155mm howitzer and five 105mm howitzers. They {{had been brought}} <b>in</b> <b>because</b> the Neutralist gunners were incapable of serving their own cannons. Bad weather intervened to delay arrival of the regimental-sized reinforcements of Group Mobile 16 (Mobile Group 16) at Muang Soui until 15 July; they were needed to prevent the possibility of fleeing Pathet Lao fleeing down Route 7 and overrunning the Neutralist outpost.|$|E
25|$|During the battle, the Vietnamese fleet {{detected}} {{two more}} Chinese warships {{rushing to the}} area. China later acknowledged these were the Hainan-class submarine chasers #281 and #282. Despite South Vietnamese reports {{that at least one}} of their ships had been struck by a missile, the Chinese insisted what the Vietnamese saw were rocket-propelled grenades fired by the crew of #389 and that no missile-capable ships were present, and the Chinese ships closed <b>in</b> <b>because</b> they had no missiles. The South Vietnamese fleet also received warnings that U.S. Navy radar had detected additional Chinese guided missile frigates and aircraft on their way from Hainan.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Bonneauville was {{governed by}} the North-West Territories, as the {{province}} of Saskatchewan {{had yet to be}} created. There was no legislative act regulating education in the area. Consequently, the school was dependent on ratepayers for funding. Having this burden enabled the residents of Bonneauville, under the North-West Territories Act of 1875, to choose which language the school would teach their children <b>in.</b> <b>Because</b> records were vague during the school's first two years of operation, it is difficult to ascertain which language they learned in. However, it is likely that they learned in French because the majority of residents were francophones in 1888.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, if this pronoun is {{the subject}} of the {{relative}} clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition et, used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left <b>in,</b> <b>because</b> in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, she- might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun.|$|E
25|$|Sierra Dominion charged Doolittle's {{campaign}} and his Superior California Political Action Committee a 15 percent commission on any contribution that Julie Doolittle helped bring in. Federal and state campaign records show that, since late 2001, {{she had received}} nearly $180,000 in commissions from for such fundraising. This meant that Doolittle {{and his family had}} personally made money off his political fundraising. Doolittle aides said even though the PAC had made payments to other fundraisers, Julie Doolittle was entitled to 15 percent of all money the PAC brought <b>in</b> <b>because</b> those donations were raised at events she helped organize.|$|E

Why a lion <b>in</b> his passion? <b>Because</b> <b>in</b> being slain, he slew death. Why a lamb <b>in</b> his resurrection? <b>Because</b> his innocence is everlasting. Why a lion <b>in</b> his resurrection? <b>Because</b> everlasting also is his might." ...|$|R

25|$|Celtic {{won their}} first eight league {{games of the}} SPL season, before losing to Rangers, who also had a 100% record, 3–1. Celtic started November beating Aberdeen 9–0 in an SPL record victory. They then lost to Hearts and drew at home against Dundee United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, with a victory over St Mirren the only consolation. The Inverness match was notable because it was officiated by Luxembourg referee Alain Hamer, who had stepped <b>in</b> <b>because</b> of the Scottish {{football}} referee strike. Celtic began 2011 by beating Rangers 2–0 at Ibrox, and beat their rivals again 3–0 on 20 February. Celtic finished the season in {{second place in the}} SPL table, a point behind Rangers.|$|E
25|$|Williams's {{first film}} {{composition}} {{was for the}} 1958 B movie Daddy-O, and his first screen credit came two years later <b>in</b> <b>Because</b> They're Young.

Williams received his first Academy Award nomination for his film score for 1967's Valley of the Dolls, and was nominated again for his score for 1969's Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Williams broke through to win his first Academy Award for his film score in the 1971 film Fiddler on the Roof. In 1972, he composed the score for the Robert Altman–directed psychological thriller Images (recorded in collaboration with noted percussionist Stomu Yamashta) which earned him another nomination in the category Best Music, Original Dramatic Score at the 1973 Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Dana Elcar as Pete Thornton, MacGyver's {{boss and}} best friend. He was an {{operative}} at the Department of External Services (DXS), {{which is where}} he is impressed by Mac's ingenuity while tracking down Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), an international assassin and master of disguise. When Thornton becomes director of operations at the Phoenix Foundation several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various tasks for the foundation, Thornton is many times forced to bail MacGyver out of the trouble he gets into. Thornton has a son named Michael. Late in the show it is learned that Pete has glaucoma, an element written <b>in</b> <b>because</b> of Elcar developing glaucoma in real life. Dana Elcar is first cast in the pilot episode as Andy Colson, the Chief of Operations at the KIVA Laboratories.|$|E

25|$|Bas started {{training}} boxing in {{the backyard}} of an elementary school with a friend. Rutten became interested in martial arts at age 12 after his family went on vacation to France, where the movie Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee was playing at a local movie theatre. Bas could not get <b>in</b> <b>because</b> the movie was rated 17+, so {{he and his brother}} Sjoerd snuck into the theatre. After he saw the movie, he took an interest in martial arts. At first, his conservative parents didn't allow him to pursue, but after two years of begging his parents, at age 14, they allowed him to practice taekwondo. He picked it up very quickly and after a few months he got in a street fight with the biggest bully in town. Rutten, now more confident, took the challenge and broke the bully's nose and KO'd him with the first punch he threw. The police showed up at his parent's place, and Rutten was immediately prohibited by his parents from further practicing martial arts.|$|E
25|$|Romuald Rajs {{made contact}} with Commandant of Okręg III Białystok of the National Military Union (Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe) Major Jan Szklarek, and moved his {{squadron}} under his command. Rajs was promoted {{to the rank of}} Captain and on 16 September 1945 became leader of the PAS Special Forces (Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej) within NZW Białystok. The process of unification of smaller underground units, commanded by Kazimierz Chmielowski ("Rekin") in the area of Wysokie Mazowieckie County until December 1945, resulted in the gathering of the largest anti-Soviet partisan group in the region, engaging in skirmishes with the communist commandos of MBP, KBW and MO. The area of the Bielsk County was especially dangerous for the underground to operate <b>in,</b> <b>because</b> the MBP field units and the NKVD received information and logistical help from the local members of the former Communist Party of Western Belarus and the Communist Party of Poland in existence before the war started.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{was handed}} a {{reprimand}} from the stewards over his late race contact with Magnussen while they elected {{not to take}} any action over the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen was adamant that Räikkönen was {{to blame for the}} incident, saying that he drove defensively but that the driver made an overtaking attempt, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he was battling his teammate Hülkenberg and did not expect Button to be in the position he placed himself <b>in</b> <b>because</b> of the lack of space for another car. Button made no comment on the incident. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reckoned that despite Vettel's turbocharger failing, the driver would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him, and stated Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the event's closing period was an indication that the approach the team used was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless the challenged driver made an error.|$|E
