5|$|At the 1921 {{rally at}} the site, {{following}} a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as {{the successor to}} the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the tree to the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> more important than symbols.|$|E
5|$|Considerable <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{put into}} {{training}} and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, {{at a cost of}} more than 600 lives lost in service.|$|E
5|$|For {{those using}} lobster traps, the fishing <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{greatest}} {{at the beginning}} of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later. Although the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more spiny lobsters during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.|$|E

50|$|An <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> made to {{relaunch}} {{the publication}} {{under a new}} name, the Art Young Quarterly, in 1922, but the <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> stillborn, with only one issue of the revised magazine seeing print.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland {{can be divided}} into two main phases. Initial <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> directed towards creating a negative image of pre-war Poland, and later <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> aimed at fostering anti-Soviet, antisemitic, and pro-German attitudes.|$|R
5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.|$|E
5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized {{could be a}} more direct successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope. This <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.|$|E
5|$|National {{security}} – The ACLU {{is opposed}} to compromising civil liberties {{in the name of}} national security. In this context, the ACLU has condemned government use of spying, indefinite detention without charge or trial, and government-sponsored torture. This <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> led by the ACLU's National Security Project.|$|E
50|$|After the {{prototype}} proved successful, a larger R&D <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> initiated in 1990, led by Herman Kading. One {{of the primary}} accomplishments of this <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> to migrate the product to UNIX Platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, and IBM.|$|R

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{makes her}} first {{literary}} appearance in Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. In Strange Visitors, Lana attempts {{to organize a}} fund raiser for {{the family of a}} school mate, Stewart, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> rendered moot when Lex Luthor and Dr. Donald Jacobi, a con artist that comes to Smallville, pick up Stewart's medical bills after a meteor rock removes all of the malignant cancer cells in his brain. In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark. It is eventually discovered that she was hypnotized by Mrs. Mayfern, whose homegrown herbal tea is fertilized by meteor rocks.|$|E

5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{endorsed}} {{by the government of}} Sri Lanka, which has agreed to assist with demarcating the country's mangroves. The Sri Lankan navy has assisted with the effort to replant mangroves in several deforested areas, and President Maithripala Sirisena has attended several Sudeesa functions, including the opening of a museum funded by the project designed to educate visitors about the mangrove ecosystem's ecological and economic importance. Following the success of its first nationwide project, Seacology is considering a similar effort in another island country.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, {{based on}} the {{screenplay}} by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, {{in the style of}} Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.|$|E
5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E

5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
