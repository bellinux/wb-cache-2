5|$|Earlier, <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> become {{concerned}} in August when {{he called}} them to say he had dropped the course, but was remaining there.

5|$|Pantulf {{was from}} Noron in the Calvados region of Normandy. <b>His</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> lived there {{since at least}} around 1030, as a charter of Jumièges Abbey shows the family as vassals of the House of Montgomery in the Montgomery lands near Sées. Pantulf's mother was named Beatrice, and his sister was named Helwise, but his father's name and other {{siblings}} are not known.|$|E
5|$|Another radical leader, Communist {{spokesman}} and one-time {{leader of}} American {{forces in the}} Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood, was born in 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were former slaves. In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked, forcing the family {{to move from the}} city. The African Blood Brotherhood, started in Omaha, contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it the group in Chicago, where <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> moved in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jean-Pierre Lafitte {{defeated}} Bob Holly {{in a standard}} dark match. In the weeks preceding the event, the WWF ran a competition to win a house in Orlando, Florida. Todd Pettengill and Stephanie Wiand showed footage {{of the home and}} later hand-picked one of the entries. They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada and told him that he and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> won the vacant home. The home was officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E

5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth. He was sickly as a young child—so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later {{attributed}} his sickness to the poverty <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> to endure. The family moved twice {{while he was still}} young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where he would eventually have his funeral service.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July Warwick had to {{withdraw}} from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been benefactors. In value, his possessions were second only {{to those of the}} earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England.|$|E
5|$|Ljotić {{finished}} {{primary school}} in Smederevo. He attended gymnasium in Salonika, where <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> relocated in 1907. Ljotić was religiously devoted {{in his youth}} and even contemplated {{a career in the}} Serbian Orthodox Church. He was greatly influenced by Leo Tolstoy's doctrine of Christian non-violence, but later rejected this doctrine during World War I. Following his father's advice, he went on to study law and graduated from the Law School of the University of Belgrade. With the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, Ljotić joined the Serbian Army.|$|E

5|$|Nikephoros Melissenos was {{probably}} born circa 1045 at Dorylaeum, where <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> extensive estates. Through both {{his father and}} his mother, he was of aristocratic descent: his father belonged to the Bourtzes line, while his mother to the illustrious Melissenos family, which dated back to the 8th century and had produced several distinguished generals. Sometime before 1067, Nikephoros married Eudokia Komnene, the second daughter of the Domestic of the Schools John Komnenos and Anna Dalassene and sister of the future Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). They had at least one known son, who was named John Komnenos.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> made him irritable and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the village of Ashington was based entirely around coal mining, and though <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> a strong footballing pedigree, {{his father was a}} miner. The eldest of four {{brothers}} – Bobby, Gordon and Tommy – the tight finances of the family meant that all four siblings shared the same bed. His father, Bob, had no interest in football, but his mother, Cissie, played football with her children and later coached the local schools team. As a teenager she took them to watch Ashington and Newcastle United play, and Charlton remained a lifelong Newcastle supporter.|$|E

5|$|The role of Mahmud {{was filled}} when Balink {{was out with}} coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome– as he {{expected}} for the role– driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which he and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant {{as a way to}} draw a higher-class audience.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> belonged.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E

5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. <b>His</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other countries, and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished father could not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig {{election}} victory. In 1833 {{he appointed}} Hogg to a lucrative {{position on the}} royal commission to examine the municipal corporations. Hogg became a fierce critic of the Municipal Corporations Act; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members, and was {{considered by many to}} be an unusually conservative Whig. His commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period, which proved to be very difficult for Jane. She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married. After receiving his appointment, Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven-year absence, but <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> not altered their opinion of his relationship with Jane.|$|E
