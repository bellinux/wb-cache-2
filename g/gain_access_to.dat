The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that {{the silence of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805â€“832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been to <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821â€“23) and Beornwulf (823â€“26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked.
