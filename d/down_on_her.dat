5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E
5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E
25|$|This {{tropical}} cyclone destroyed telephone and telegraph lines leading into Acapulco, cutting that city {{off from the}} outside world for four days. Numerous buildings in the city were damaged. Several fishing boats were missing, and a woman was killed when a telephone pole was blown <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

25|$|In addition, she {{was given}} overdue tribute in 1958, on This is Your Life with Ralph Edwards. It brought a tearful reunion with Helen's old friend, actress Fifi D'Orsay, and a lifelong fan who once sent her money when she was <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> luck. Renewed {{interest}} in Helen brought her a one-record contract with MGM Records and appearances on I've Got a Secret and You Asked for It. She sang {{on all of these}} TV shows.|$|E
25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, a {{moderate}} baron with strong French links, intervened {{in an attempt}} to defuse the crisis. Edward continued to refuse to negotiate or exile the Despensers, so Pembroke arranged for Queen Isabella to publicly go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers. This provided him with a face-saving excuse to exile the Despensers and defuse the crisis, but it was clear Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E
25|$|The film follows Lăzărescu's {{journey through}} the night, as he is carried from one {{hospital}} to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine Lăzărescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, each team refuses to admit him and sends him to another hospital. Meanwhile, Lăzărescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or {{because they do not}} feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 9 February 1843 Larkins {{arrived in}} the <b>Downs</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> return from China. A gale {{developed}} and although two steam tugs had been dispatched to bring her up the Thames, the weather was too strong to permit them to take her in tow. As the weather drove her towards the shore, the captain cut away her main and mizzen masts; still, on 12 February the gale drove her onshore about a mile east of Margate. She had a cargo of tea.|$|R
25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank would be asked of Somers, and she would write it <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue picking on audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Hugh de Despenser {{the younger}} became an {{increasing}} favourite of Isabella's husband, and was {{widely believed to}} have begun {{a sexual relationship with}} him around this time. Hugh was the same age as Edward. His father, Hugh the elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously. The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and with Edward's support began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of Roger Mortimer de Chirk and his nephew, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, their rival Marcher lords. Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward's previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster's rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre. In 1321, Lancaster's alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war; Isabella publicly went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{also participated}} in the 1981 World Championships, her last major {{international}} event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova contributed more points towards the Soviet team score than anyone else. She {{finished third in the}} all-around final after an improper landing in the balance beam event. Had she not sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> beam dismount she would have won gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd AA and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. Davydova was the total points top scoring gymnast at the 1981 World Championships. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars. She would have won gold on vault but was unable to stand the incredibly difficult vault of her own invention, full twist on front tuck off. Jackie Fie, the US Head Judge on vault at the 81 World championships wrote that if the other vaults were to be marked out of 10 then Davydova's one should be scored out of 10.5. Davydova's vault was the pinnacle of the event. It was the most difficult vault of the competition – in either women's or men's gymnastics. Davydova {{is the only one who}} has done a vault that a male gymnast has not. Until Gabrielle Douglas 2015, she was the only IOC Olympic champion, since 1980, to have medalled in a World Championships after she had won the Olympic AA title.|$|E

500|$|At the final, held on May 20, 2006, Anna Vissi {{appeared}} on stage {{surrounded by a}} fog effect created by dry ice. She was alone on the large stage and wore an exclusive Jean Paul Gaultier black and white outfit with black leggings. By {{the end of the}} song, she was <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knees singing. Her choreography for the final was arranged by Mia Michaels. Although considered a favorite, she finished in an honorable 9th position, making Greece only one of two countries that were automatically in the final that managed a top 10 position. She received 128 points, including the coveted [...] "douze points" [...] from Bulgaria and Cyprus.|$|E
500|$|At around 10:00, Nürnberg {{came under}} heavy {{fire from the}} British cruisers, as well as the {{powerful}} battlecruisers [...] and , armed with [...] guns. Nürnberg was not hit directly, but shell splinters from near misses rained <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> deck and killed one man and wounded four more, one of whom later died of his wounds. One of her rangefinders was also damaged by the shell fragments. She returned fire briefly before the haze again concealed the British ships. Kaiser and Kaiserin intervened at almost exactly the same time, prompting the British to break off the engagement immediately. Within an hour, the German forces were reinforced by several capital ships, including the battlecruiser after realizing the British had fled, the German forces returned to port.|$|E

60|$|However, by {{vigorous}} exertion, Thomas {{found that}} a Danish ship would be lying in the <b>Downs,</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> way to the East Indies, and that a passage in her would cost 100l. for a full-grown person and 50l. for a child. Posting down to Northamptonshire, Carey made a desperate effort to persuade his wife to come with him, and succeeded at last, <b>on</b> condition that <b>her</b> sister, Miss Old, should come too. There were now five children, and the passage-money for the whole party amounted to 600l., of which their utmost efforts, including the sale of all the little property the Careys possessed, could only raise half.|$|R
500|$|Ayane {{is officially}} {{one of the}} [...] "faces" [...] of Dead or Alive. In the series' back story, Ayane was {{conceived}} and born {{as a result of}} the evil ninja Raidou's rape of Ayame, Kasumi's mother and wife of Shiden, leader of the [...] ninja clan. Ayane is overshadowed by her half-sister Kasumi and bears jealousy and hatred towards her and her privileged upbringing. The Mugen Tenshin villagers allowed Ayane to stay, but disliked and looked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Since they were children, Ayane has secretly admired her half-brother Hayate as a way of increasing her self-esteem. Hayate is portrayed as fond of her in return. Besides Kasumi, Ayame's ire focusses on Raidou who both created and ruined her life. Ayane's envy towards Kasumi is similar to the hatred Raidou had towards Shiden, Kasumi's father.|$|E
500|$|Further rumours {{spread that}} Louise {{was having an}} affair with Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, the Queen's {{assistant}} private secretary. Beatrice mentioned the rumours to the Queen's physician, calling it a [...] "scandal", and Prince Henry claimed to have seen Bigge drinking to Louise's health at dinner. Louise denied the rumour, claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court. However, on Henry's death, relations between the sisters sporadically improved, and it was Louise, rather than the Queen, who was the first to arrive at Cimiez to be with the widowed Beatrice. Nevertheless, Louise's jealousy did not evaporate completely. James Reid, the Queen's physician, wrote to his wife a few years later: [...] "Louise is as usual much <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sisters. Hope she won't stay long or she will do mischief!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E

50|$|In 1852, Lindsay {{ordered the}} 900 ton W. S. Lindsay, the largest iron ship {{that had been}} built to date from the Tyneside {{shipyard}} of Coutts and Parkinson. She was designed to take emigrants to Australia and although she cost one-third more than similar vessels, the ship was three times more efficient with 280 cabins including 60 in first class. Lindsay held 54 of the 64 shares in the ship and her master, George Western, the other ten. The W. S. Lindsay overturned in a storm in The <b>Downs</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> maiden voyage with 300 passengers aboard; {{she had to be}} towed back to London at a cost of £3,000.|$|R
500|$|West regains his lyrical dexterity on [...] "Barry Bonds", a competitive, though {{friendly}} {{battle with}} Lil Wayne {{in which the}} two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes. The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West's ability to create music hits. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] is a first-person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for. [...] "Everything I Am" [...] is a song of self-examination, in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his outspokeness ruminating over various ways people expect him to conduct himself. In the track, West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona, his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper, his inclination towards social commentary, and his lack of self-restraint. West comes to the conclusion that while he {{will never be able to}} live up to people's expectations and will always be disadvantageously flawed; it's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is. When writing the song, West thought of a young girl in high school dealing with people coming <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E
500|$|... "Iggy SZN" [...] {{received}} mixed reception {{from music}} critics. An editor from the website Music Times compared the minimal production {{on the track}} to that of Azalea's previous single [...] "Fancy" [...] featuring Charli XCX (2014), writing that [...] "It's not quite as catchy as 'Fancy,' {{but it is still}} a lot of fun." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin opined that the background on [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was similar to works done by Diplo. He further shared that, [...] "she'll need to do a little better than 'Iggy SZN' if she wants to keep anyone's interest." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News commented [...] "the star doubles <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> love of 'fancy' (read: gimmicky) hooks, pitting a shrill beat, a lion's roar and a nagging synth against one another for attention." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator, while reviewing Reclassified, said that, [...] "Of the trio of fuck-you anthems, 'Iggy SZN' is the most light-hearted and upbeat. It showcases Iggy's knack for memorable quips – 'what they make in a year, I can make in a week' – and The Invisible Men's ability to deliver crazy beats." [...] Rory Cashin of State added that the song is [...] "built on hand claps and a deep electronic buzz, which will sound great in a high tempo Zumba class." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic also complimented [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] stating that it [...] "is wonderful schoolyard silliness and helps to add some charm to Iggy's ice-queen persona".|$|E
