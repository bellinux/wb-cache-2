5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{the theory of evolution}} around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the series, Jackson <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{her singing}} {{as merely a}} private hobby. The Jacksons {{as well as an}} early love of musicals—motivated her to become a {{professional}} recording artist, and the show's producer encouraged her to sing. Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time, as well as a cabaret singer. She contributed her voice for songs by artists such as The Emotions, Sonny Bono, and Betty Wright before Jackson's second pregnancy stalled her musical career for a short time.|$|E

5|$|Aquaria was {{developed}} by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka {{over the course of}} two years, off of a concept that Holowka <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm O.K with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology. Aquaria is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but are not doing so as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky.|$|E

25|$|With {{the turn}} of the 20th Century, the {{perception}} of Ybor City residents had evolved. Previously, many residents <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Tampa as a temporary place to work and live; a refuge from the political and/or economic troubles in their homelands. By the early 1900s, however, attitudes had changed. Ybor City had become a permanent home.|$|E

25|$|Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant {{developed}} a vector calculus {{similar to that}} of Grassmann which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} ENIAC after 1948, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the Function Tables as program ROM, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Richard Clippinger of BRL. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (15) {{was used as the}} main accumulator, a third accumulator (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1–5, 7, 9–14, 17–19) were used for data memory.|$|E
25|$|Brownlow's 1980 {{reconstruction}} was re-edited {{and released}} in the United States by American Zoetrope (through Universal Pictures) with a score by Carmine Coppola performed live at the screenings. The restoration premiered in the United States at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 23–25 January 1981; each performance showed to a standing room only house. Gance could not attend because of poor health. At {{the end of the}} 24 January screening, a telephone was brought onstage and the audience was told that Gance was listening on the other end and wished to know what they <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his film. The audience erupted in an ovation of applause and cheers that lasted several minutes. The acclaim surrounding the film's revival brought Gance much-belated recognition as a master director before his death only 11 months later, in November 1981.|$|E

500|$|The coins {{were sold}} at $3 each. [...] They were {{available}} {{in a case of}} issue, or could be purchased mounted in spoons and various sorts of jewelry. [...] Some were mounted with solder, which has impaired their present-day numismatic value; others were sold with mountings that did not damage the coin. Zerbe <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> these varied ways of selling the coin, and many of the sales at the fair were in this manner. No additional charge was made for these adornments.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} {{expensive}} and by November 1923, the Association decided {{to advocate for}} a commemorative coin which it could buy from the government at face value and sell at a premium as a fundraiser.

Webb, executive secretary of the Association, said he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it after finding an Alabama centennial half dollar at home; journalist Harry Stillwell Edwards made a similar claim and apparently collected a reward from the Association.|$|E

500|$|Mankiewicz <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> turning Solitaire {{into a black}} woman, with Diana Ross as {{his primary}} choice. However, Broccoli and Saltzman decided to stick to Fleming's {{description}} of a white woman, and after thinking of Catherine Deneuve, Jane Seymour, {{who was in the}} TV series The Onedin Line, was cast for the role. Yaphet Kotto was cast while doing another movie for United Artists, Across 110th Street. Kotto reported {{one of the things he}} liked in the role was Kananga's interest in the occult, [...] "feeling like he can control past, present and future".|$|E
500|$|Hammerstein <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{writing a}} play about a man, from birth to death. [...] However, having just killed his leading male character, Billy Bigelow, onstage in Carousel, he was {{reluctant}} to kill off another. [...] In the end, he took his protagonist from birth to age35. [...] He envisioned a simply staged work like Our Town which after its initial run would lend itself to college productions. [...] Allegro was conceived as taking place in an open space, using props and projections to convey scenery to the audience. [...] In addition to the usual singing chorus, there would be a speaking chorus, {{in the manner of a}} Greek chorus, which would comment on the action, and speak to both characters and audience.|$|E
500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it.

500|$|The Barrack-Room Ballads, as {{the name}} suggests, are songs of soldiers. Written by Kipling, they share a form and a style with {{traditional}} Army songs. Kipling {{was one of the}} first to pay attention to these works; Charles Carrington noted that in contrast to the songs of sailors, [...] "no-one <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> collecting genuine soldiers' songs, and when Kipling wrote in this traditional style it was not recognised as traditional". Kipling himself was fond of singing his poetry, of writing it to fit the rhythm of a particular tune. In this specific case, the musical source has been suggested as the Army's [...] "grotesque bawdy song" [...] Barnacle Bill the Sailor, but it is possible that some other popular tune of the period was used.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Evita (1976), a sung-through concept album by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber {{detailing}} the life of Eva Perón, director Alan Parker met with their manager David Land, asking if Rice and Lloyd Webber <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> making a film version. He understood {{that they were more}} interested in creating a stage version with the album's original lyrics. The original West End theatre production of Evita opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on June 21, 1978, and closed on February 18, 1986. The subsequent Broadway production opened at the Broadway Theatre on September 25, 1979 and closed on June 26, 1983 after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Robert Stigwood, producer of the West End production, wanted Parker to direct Evita as a film but, after completing work on the musical Fame (1980), Parker turned down the opportunity to helm Evita, telling Stigwood that he [...] "didn't want to do back-to-back musicals".|$|E
500|$|As soon as Starr {{arrived in}} Delhi he asked Evans {{to take him}} to a doctor because of a {{reaction}} to an inoculation: [...] "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say it will be all right". Also there at the same time were Mia Farrow, her sister Prudence and brother John, Donovan, Gyp [...] "Gypsy Dave" [...] Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, journalist Lewis H. Lapham, film-maker Paul Saltzman, socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera, actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin, and dozens of others, all Europeans or Americans.
