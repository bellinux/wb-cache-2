40|$|Objective: Patients with {{narcolepsy}} often experience pervasive <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> {{sometimes even}} leading to confusion with schizophrenia. We aimed {{to provide a}} detailed qualitative description of <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and other "psychotic" symptoms in patients with narcolepsy and contrast these with schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. We also compared the prevalence of formal psychotic disorders between narcolepsy patients and controls. Methods: We used SCAN 2. 1 interviews to compare psychotic symptoms between 60 patients with narcolepsy, 102 with schizophrenia and 120 matched population controls. In addition, qualitative data was collected to enable {{a detailed description of}} <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in narcolepsy. Results: There were clear differences in the pattern of hallucinatory experiences in narcolepsy vs. schizophrenia patients. Narcoleptics reported multisensory "holistic" hallucinations rather than the predominantly verbal-auditory sensory mode of schizophrenia patients. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions were not more frequent in narcolepsy compared to population controls. In addition, the prevalence of formal psychotic disorders was not increased in patients with narcolepsy. Almost half of narcoleptics reported moderate interference with functioning due to <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> mostly due to related anxiety. Conclusions: <b>Hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> in narcolepsy can be differentiated on a phenomenological basis from hallucinations in schizophrenia which is useful in differential diagnostic dilemmas.

Summary: This report describes a case of first-onset narcolepsy in a six-year-old female that was misdiagnosed as atypical epilepsy and other diagnoses at eight different hospitals over a period of 10 months before the correct diagnosis was made. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is more difficult in children because very few of them experience all four cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy – paroxysmal sleep, cataplexy, <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucination,</b> and sleep paralysis – and they often have a more prolonged onset and diverse symptoms. To decrease the time lag between initial presentation and accurate diagnosis, we recommend that in all cases in which children report excessive sleep of unknown etiology – regardless of the associated symptoms – that sleep monitoring and sleep latency tests be conducted to rule out the possibility of narcolepsy. The case highlights the wide variety of presentations of uncommon psychiatric conditions, particularly in children, and the need for clinicians {{to be aware of the}} atypical presentations of these conditions when collecting medical histories...|$|E

During afternoon naps, participants were repetitively awakened 15, 45, 75, 120 or 180 s after the onset of S 1, and were asked to report their mental content. Reports content was scored by three judges (inter-rater reliability 85 %). In the experimental group, 48 out of 485 (10 %) sleep-onset reports were Tetris-related. They mostly consisted of images and sounds with very little emotional content. They exactly reproduced Tetris elements or mixed them with other mnemonic components. By contrast, in the first control group, only one report out of 107 was scored as Tetris-related (1 %), and in the second control group only three reports out of 112 were scored as Tetris-related (3 %; between-groups comparison; P = 0. 006). <b>Hypnagogic</b> <b>hallucinations</b> were more consistently induced by experience than by anticipation (P = 0. 039), and they were predominantly observed during the transition of wakefulness to sleep.

Symptomatic narcolepsy should be suspected in cases where narcolepsy is detected in preteenage children, where cataplectic attacks are abnormally frequent, where there is an absence of polygraphic evidence of classical narcolepsy (although this criterion may not apply in the case of younger children) or where human leukocyte antigen typing for DR 2 is negative.

Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep.
