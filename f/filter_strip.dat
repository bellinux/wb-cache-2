40|$|The {{populations of}} many bird {{species in the}} United States that use early-successional {{habitats}} have been substantially declining over the last 40 years. The main reason for these declines is habitat loss. Land enrolled in the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) often represents the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in the mid-Atlantic and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. CRP <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> are strips of herbaceous vegetation that are planted along agricultural field margins and are usually planted with native warm-season grasses or introduced cool-season grasses. We studied the breeding and wintering bird use of CRP <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> adjacent to wooded edges in Maryland from 2004 - 2007. We conducted bird and vegetation surveys in <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> and measured landscape attributes around CRP plantings. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities and abundances, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> for birds. Bird community metrics were greater in <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> than in field margins without <b>filter</b> <b>strips,</b> but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass <b>filter</b> <b>strips.</b> Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata). Several grassland birds were more common in wide <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> (> 60 m) compared to narrower <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> (< 30 m). The density of early-successional bird species was greater in <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> with higher plant species richness and shorter and less dense grasses. Wintering bird use was significantly less in <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> mowed in the fall than in unmowed <b>filter</b> <b>strips.</b> The abundance of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), an important game bird and species of conservation concern, was positively associated with the percent cover of CRP land in the surrounding landscape. These {{results suggest that the}} CRP has created additional habitat for many early-successional bird species, but changes in the planning and management of CRP plantings may improve their habitat value for breeding and wintering birds...|$|R

Moreover, settling basins are useful to remove unwanted solid materials, such as hay, straw and feathers from the waste stream before flowing to the lagoon, aids to reduce smell and avoid crust formation on the lagoon surface. A baffle {{may be used to}} retain the floating solids removed. There are two types of settling basins, based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.|$|E

In addition, the public views them as landscaped amenities and not as stormwater infrastructure. Consequently, there is little resistance to their use. Inspection/Maintenance Considerations Vegetated buffer strips require frequent landscape maintenance. In many cases, vegetated buffer strips initially require intense maintenance, but less maintenance is needed over time. In many cases, maintenance tasks can be completed by a landscaping contractor. Maintenance requirements typically include grass or shrub-growing activities such as irrigation, mowing, trimming, removal of invasive species, and replanting when necessary. Buffer strips require more tending as the volume of sediment increases. Vegetated buffer strips can become a nuisance due to mosquito breeding in level spreaders (unless designed to dewater completely in 72 hours or less) and/or if proper drainage slopes are not maintained...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityThe use of {{vegetative}} <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> (VFSs) in the mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads from agriculturally derived overland flows is {{a widespread}} practice. VFSs {{have been used in}} a wide variety of situations to treat runoff from croplands, feed lots, dairy operations, confined animal feeding operations, and roadsides, among other locations. While vegetative matter must regularly be removed from vegetative <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> in an effort to prevent them from becoming nutrient load sources, very limited attempts have been made (with the exception of biofuel harvesting) to harvest that biomass for a useable purpose. This dissertation examines the novel approach of establishing vegetative <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> on the ends of surface-irrigated, row-cropped fields with commonly utilized forage species for the direct mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads in overland flow while concurrently producing a marketable forage crop. A review of the pertinent literature is provided followed by a detailed overview of the experimental setup. Five commonly utilized forage crops were used to establish vegetative <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> of varying lengths on the ends of furrow-irrigated, row-cropped fields in an arid environment. Vegetative <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> of 3. 05 (10 ft), 6. 07 m (20 ft), and 9. 14 m (30 ft) in width were found to have removal efficiencies exceeding 99 % for: total inflow volume, total suspended solids, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -H, PO 4 -P and total P while yielding marketable forage biomass at a rates roughly comparable to average yields from regional hay farms. Statistical analyses on mean removal efficiencies showed a significant statistical difference among the performance of VFS width and vegetation cover type for mean suspended sediment removal efficiencies, and among vegetation cover type for NH 4 -N mean removal efficiencies. No significant statistical difference was shown among either vegetation cover types or VFS width for mean removal efficiencies of NO 3 -N, PO 4 -P or total P.

Monitoring of fifteen established filter strips in the Parrett Catchment, England, informed on the complexity of intercepting flow pathways to optimise <b>filter</b> <b>strip</b> performance. Results suggest that a 6 m VFS will trap an average of 1. 74 t year - 1 of material from a field of 1 ha, but this is highly variable depending on design, placement and management factors. In most cases the majority of coarse sediment is trapped at the upslope edge of the VFS and is typically > 85 % sand. A revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model was tested against a range of field and laboratory datasets and an efficiency coefficient of 0. 7 was achieved. When testing the model against the field results from the Parrett Catchment, an active <b>filter</b> <b>strip</b> area was used. This took into account only the area of the <b>filter</b> <b>strip</b> effective in trapping sediment due to the convergence and bypassing of flow pathways.

30|$|The {{observed}} {{changes in}} water balance such as decreased evapotranspiration and increased percolation, groundwater flow and recharge {{as well as}} total water yield (Fig.  23) are dependent on land and water management practices. Contours and terracing reduce the steep slope of the land and, therefore, reduce and delay the surface runoff and allows {{a long time for}} rainwater percolation (Dou et al. 2009). Deep ripper tillage increases soil depth and enhances percolation and ultimately reduces overland surface flow (Lacey 2008). Grassed waterways reduce runoff volumes due to their comparably high infiltration rates and the reduction in runoff velocity. The grassed waterways reduced runoff by 10 and 90 %, respectively, in the two watersheds in Munich (Fiener and Auerswald 2003). This is contrary to the unexpected increased surface runoff in the current study of about 31 % under both grassed waterways and terrace and contouring (Fig.  23). Nevertheless, in this study, the surface runoff under <b>filter</b> <b>strips</b> was higher than in other management interventions (Fig.  23).
