5|$|By 2005 the {{building}} was in a bad state of repair, and was threatened with demolition. Although heritage groups won a stay of execution, the cinema was demolished in spring 2008. A replacement building is planned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

5|$|The broch shows more {{evidence}} of David Balfour's influence on Shapinsay.

5|$|The {{official}} name <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{in ancient times}} was The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health in The West of Thebes (see below for the hieroglyphic spelling), or Ta-sekhet-ma'at (the Great Field).|$|E
5|$|A {{public meeting}} in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His design for a bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E

He was voted Restaurateur of the Year at the Tatler Restaurant Awards in 2004, and Harden's restaurant guide selected him as the fourth-best chef in London, although La Fleur closed due to problems with the lease <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> In 2007 Pétrus was awarded its second Michelin star.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19thcentury, the dukes {{refurbished}} Warkworth Castle and Anthony Salvin was commissioned {{to restore the}} keep. Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, gave custody of the castle to the Office of Works in 1922. Since 1984 English Heritage has cared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> which is a GradeI listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived {{in one corner of the}} keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Islamic reverence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{is derived}} from the belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E

5|$|The {{poor quality}} gravel soil, {{which had been}} <b>the</b> initial reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site's</b> cheapness and its {{selection}} as <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The LNC's rails, and in particular its sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|R
5|$|Metacritic later {{noted that}} Ebert tended {{to give more}} lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71% if {{translated}} into a percentage, compared to 59% <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> as a whole. 75% of his reviews were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he {{had a reputation for}} writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as North.|$|E

5|$|The close {{distance}} between Mill Point and Point Lewis {{at the foot}} of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849. A bridge was proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary planning for a bridge at the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement, The Causeway, could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end. The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for a bridge at The Narrows.|$|E
5|$|The first prior was Aldwyn, {{who founded}} the monastery on his bishop's advice, and by 1135 the monastery {{included}} thirty monks. Aldwyn was succeeded by Walcher of Malvern, an astronomer and philosopher from Lorraine, whose gravestone inside the priory church records details that the priory arose in 1085 from a hermitage endowed by Edward the Confessor. An ancient stained glass window in the Priory church depicts the legend of St. Werstan, with details of his vision, the consecration of his chapel, Edward the Confessor granting the charter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> and Werstan's martyrdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in 2002 by the United States Congress, but federal funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via {{amendment to the}} Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011. The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the non-local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.|$|E
