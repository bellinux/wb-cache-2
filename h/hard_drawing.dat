At the climax of the first act, Becca tells Barry (playing Becca's brother) that she has told his wife about his adultery.

40|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>drawing</b> is an {{operation}} done to a metal {{in order to}} increase its strength. The operation causes dislocation motion in the metal and sufficient work causes the creation of extra dislocations through the operation Frank-Read sources. These dislocations "lock" together, making yield of the material more difficult, hence increasing its strength. This process also causes the metal to be more brittle. The act of drawing causes deformation of the grains in the direction of drawing as seen in this sample. ...|$|E

60|$|A beat of hoofs, partly {{muffled by}} the snow, {{came down the}} bitter wind, and {{a few moments later}} a {{horseman}} appeared from behind the trees. He was indistinct in the gathering gloom, but seemed to be riding furiously, and <b>Harding</b> <b>drew</b> the oxen out of the trail.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{physicist}} and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton. Using Harding's middle name, the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund. When conceptualizing the firm, <b>Harding</b> <b>drew</b> inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company.

We explain some of the difficulties that arose and offer a technique for the reconstruction of the transverse phase space distribution of the beam based on the measurements, which contain only the spatial components...|$|R

50|$|While {{the spiritual}} {{implications}} <b>Harding</b> <b>drew</b> from the experiments are deeply traditional, the exercises themselves {{may be said}} to constitute a new category of spiritual experience, which he sometimes summed up as “meditation for the marketplace”. They expand and ground in sense experience numerous references - to vision for example - found scattered throughout spiritual literature and so often understood only symbolically or metaphorically. But all this amounted to only half the story and he never failed to stress that, while Who or What one really is may be easy to see, learning to trust and live consciously in the light of that reality is an immensely demanding and lifelong challenge.|$|R

5000|$|According to Bartle: [...] "The 4-part {{version is}} easy to draw because it's 2D, but the 8-part one is 3D; it's {{therefore}} much <b>harder</b> to <b>draw</b> {{in such a way}} as it doesn't collapse in a mass of lines." [...] There is no known online test based on this model.|$|R

50|$|Lewis {{was first}} {{selected}} {{to play for}} Wales in the 1926 Five Nations Championship when he faced England at the Cardiff Arms Park on the 16 January. Lewis was one of 8 new Welsh caps on the day, and the relative inexperienced team, under the captaincy of Rowe <b>Harding,</b> <b>drew</b> 3-3 with the England team. Lewis was dropped {{for the rest of}} the tournament, but was back in 1927, again against England, but this time at Twickenham. Wales lost the match 11-9, though the team played with only 14 men for most of the match, when Newports Dai Jones was injured in the first quarter of an hour. Lewis's last game was for Ossie Male's team against Scotland, again in the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Wales lost at home 5-0 and Lewis was never selected for any future games.|$|R
50|$|When the dam {{was being}} voted on local {{municipalities}} {{had just been}} given {{the right to use}} eminent domain for construction of projects like this. However, the use of eminent domain was not used to secure the necessary right. At the time there were no other dams upstream of the Sturgis Dam. The original design of the dam had four floors in the powerhouse. When first constructed, there was the 2,300-volt oil switches and 23,000-volt lightning arresters on the switchroom floor. The lowest floor held six 200-kW oil-cooled transformers. The original transmission line out was a 17 mi three-phase line of No. 4 B & S <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> copper. The bond that was approved was for $175,000 however the cost came to $250,000. When the dam was constructed it caused the Langley Covered Bridge to be raised 8 ft.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Harding</b> <b>drew</b> various strips for Roy of the Rovers between 1976 and 1993, but it {{was only}} in the annuals that he got to {{illustrate}} the adventures of Roy Race himself. In 1976-77 he drew the controversial football strip [...] "Look Out For Lefty", written by Tom Tully, for Action, taking over from his friend Barrie Mitchell. Harding regarded it as a [...] "cheeky", humorous story, but objected to some of the things he was asked to draw, for example refusing to depict Lefty sticking two fingers up to the crowd. He did draw a scene involving a character throwing a bottle from the crowd and hitting a player on the head, thinking the player was [...] "such a horror" [...] he deserved it. This story caused controversy, making the Daily Mail under the headline [...] "Comic Strip Hooligans".|$|R
5000|$|Since {{many cases}} of Talon cusp go unreported, it is <b>hard</b> to <b>draw</b> linkage maps but {{it is safe to}} assume that dental {{formation}} is influenced by genetic factors.

50|$|Drawn {{from left}} to right, a {{decision}} tree has only burst nodes (splitting paths) but no sink nodes (converging paths).
