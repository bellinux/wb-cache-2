The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

Analysis of variance yielded greatest differences relative to handball performance in the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> specific agility and throwing strength, and the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> basic motoricity that integrates the ability of coordination (agility) with upper extremity throwing explosiveness and lower extremity sprint (30 -m sprint) and jumping (standing triple jump). Considering morphological <b>factors,</b> the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> voluminosity, i. e. mesoendomorphy, which is defined by muscle mass rather than adipose tissue, was found to contribute significantly to the players’ performance. Results of regression analysis indicated the handball performance to be predominantly determined by the general specific motor factor based on specific agility and explosiveness, and by the morphological factor based on body mass and volume, i. e. muscle mass. Concerning basic motor abilities, the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> movement frequency rate, which {{is associated with the}} ability of ball manipulation, was observed to predict significantly the handball players’ performance...|$|R
