50|$|The TU/e also {{provides}} education to {{an increasing number}} of foreign students and graduates. According to the 2009 annual report in the academic year 2008-2009 there were 490 exchange students, 103 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> <b>registered</b> in a bachelor program, 430 in a master program, 158 in a professional doctorate program (79% of the total). In 2009 the university employed 37 foreign professors (15.9% of the total) and 16 foreign associate professors (12.8%). Overall, 29.5% of the university staff was non-Dutch.|$|R
50|$|As of 2009, a {{total number}} of 1,714,000 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were <b>registered</b> as {{residing}} in Switzerland, accounting for 22.0% of total population. Of these, 1,680,000 had permanent residence (excluding exchange students, seasonal workers and asylum seekers). Of these, 354,000 were born in Switzerland. Another 522,000 had resided in Switzerland for more than 15 years.Swiss nationality law permits naturalization {{after a period of}} twelve years. 43,440 people were naturalized as Swiss citizens in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Yokohama's Nishi Ward even granted {{an honorary}} jūminhyō (residency registration) to Tama-chan. In early 2003 this {{prompted}} {{a group of}} foreign residents protesting against the fact that jūminhyō is only open to Japanese citizens (<b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were <b>registered</b> under a separate system), to stage a march with whiskers drawn on their faces to demand a jūminhyō even though Saitama Prefecture has given fictional jūminhyō to public fixtures before either real or imaginary, such as Crayon Shin-Chan. That system was later changed, and from July 9, 2012 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> residing in Japan are registered in the jūminhyō.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{the figures}} were amended: {{actually}}, two <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> had <b>registered</b> to vote, {{and of the}} two only one had actually voted, apparently accidentally. In 2014 Duran won reelection, outspending challenger Bernalillo County Clerk Maggie Toulouse Oliver $195,635 to $145,690 on television ads alone. In 2015 she testified in favor of HB340 before the Legislature's Judiciary Committee. The bill, which would have mandated a requirement for voter ID, did pass out of committee on a party-line vote, but died {{on the floor of}} the Legislature.|$|R
25|$|Working-age {{population}} makes 63% of the total, 13% {{are younger}} and 24% {{are older than}} the working age. The number of children born in 2008 was 1278; this is 137 more than in 2007, yet this {{about half of the}} value required for population replacement; 285 children were born by unmarried mothers. 1471 marriage and 742 divorce acts were registered in 2009. The fraction of women in the total population is 54%, and the difference is especially large (2700 women per 1000 men) for citizen outside of working age. The average age of residents is 40 years and is increasing. During 11 months of 2009, 19,316 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were <b>registered</b> in Pushkin, that is 3,500 more than in 2008.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} be counted as an {{immigrant}} in the Netherlands, a <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> should be <b>registered</b> in the Municipal Personal Records Database (BRP). In the Netherlands, CBS is the only authority authorised to draw samples based on the BRP and to link registers and surveys into the System of Social Statistical Datasets (Bakker, Van Rooijen, & Van Toor, 2014). As a consequence, almost all national large-scale surveys on immigrants are based on sample designs developed by CBS. An exception is a survey within one single municipality as each municipality has the rights to draw samples from its own BRP.|$|R
30|$|Though the Spanish {{population}} registers are a preferred source for studying spatial distribution, we must nevertheless mention their limits. First, registers may sometimes overestimate {{the number of}} foreigners who leave Spain without being removed from the register (or when a community delays in removing individuals from the register). In recognition of this limit, the INE implemented two sets of measures in 2004 and 2006 to automatically remove <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from the <b>register</b> {{when they do not}} renew their registration every 2  years. Padrón’s second limitation is related to categorization; the acquisition of Spanish nationality (or dual nationality) by a number of foreign (especially Latin American) immigrants has led to the disappearance of individuals as <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> although they remain immigrants. Moreover, referring to places of birth instead of nationality would not be a solution. Using this criterion, Spaniards born outside the national territory would be considered as <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> 3 Such cases have been numerous since the emigration of the Franco period.|$|R
5000|$|On January 1, 2011, Duran became New Mexico’s 24th Secretary of State. She was {{the first}} Republican elected to that office since 1928. She promised {{initiatives}} to modernize and streamline operations and cut costs. She said her primary objective was {{the integrity of the}} electoral system and that she believed that in a republic, legitimacy rested on the people’s belief that elections are conducted fairly, votes are counted correctly, and that only eligible voters are allowed to participate. On July 31, 2011 Duran cited a [...] "culture of corruption" [...] when she turned the names of 64,000 voters over to the state police, saying they did not match the Social Security and motor vehicle data bases. She also said that 117 <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> had <b>registered</b> to vote and 37 had actually done so. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a public information request for the records in question, saying that they wanted to verify the statement. But Duran refused, citing executive privilege.|$|R
30|$|Analysing {{official}} statistics on marriage registrations, Jeffreys and Pan (2013) {{find that the}} number of Chinese-foreign marriages grew almost tenfold between 1979 and 2010, followed by a slight decline in recent years. Their findings moreover suggest that a sizeable majority of these marriages involves a spouse from Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan or an overseas Chinese partner from another country. Still, more than 20, 000 marriages with a non-Chinese <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> were <b>registered</b> every year between 2000 and 2010 (Jeffreys and Pan 2013 : 355). While the considerable increase of transnational marriages in China corresponds to broader trends in East and Southeast Asia, the proportion of Chinese citizens involved in such marriages is substantially smaller than in many neighbouring nations. Jones (2012) documents considerable variations across the region. His estimates range from 39  % in Singapore (2008) and 32  % in Taiwan (2003) to 11  % in South Korea (2010), 5  % in Japan, 3  % in Vietnam (2005), and only 0.7  % in the People’s Republic of China (Jones 2012 : 2). This suggests that transnational marriages continue to be a minor phenomenon relative to the size of China’s population. Jeffreys and Pan (2013) suggest that these marriages are concentrated in wealthier, highly urbanised regions on the country’s east coast.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the study into the status of foreigners in the Czech labour market. It is divided in two {{consecutive}} units, the first of which contains a theoretical basis for the functioning of labor markets (segments of the labour market, the historical context of labour migration in our country and the legislative framework applicable to the economically active foreigners in the Czech Republic). Another section is devoted to analytical exploration of the topic. It is dealt with the structure of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> (employment offices <b>registered</b> with a valid trade license), by nationality, age, gender, level of education, type of work performed, etc. For the purpose of this research the author comes out of the available data published by the Czech Statistical Office, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and other sources.
