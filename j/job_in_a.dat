5|$|Betty and {{her husband}} Cyril move to Coronation Street in June 1969, helping her sister Maggie to run the local corner shop {{following}} the breakup of Maggie's marriage to Les Clegg. Maggie, however, resents Betty's interference and persuades landlord Jack Walker (Arthur Leslie) to give Betty {{a job as a}} barmaid at The Rovers Return Inn public house. Betty clashes with the landlady Annie (Doris Speed), who fears that Jack may find her attractive, and fires Betty as a result. Betty takes a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rival pub, and returns only when Annie apologises. Betty becomes close friends with fellow barmaid Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), who on occasion lodges with her, uses Betty as a chaperone on dates, and frequently seeks her advice in running her life.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until he lost his <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, {{trying to understand the}} reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer {{was born}} in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Julius Oppenheimer, a wealthy Jewish textile {{importer}} who had immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1888, and Ella Friedman, a painter.

He got a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> textile company and within a decade was an executive with the company. Ella was from Baltimore. The Oppenheimers were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews. In 1912 the family moved to an apartment on the 11th floor of 155 Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses.

5|$|After {{the breakup}} of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, {{to return to his}} native city of Chicago, where he took a <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning {{themselves}} with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live {{for the first time on}} July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.|$|E
