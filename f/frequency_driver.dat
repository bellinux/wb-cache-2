2500|$|The {{areas of}} {{innovation}} were in cabinet design, durability, ease of packing and transport, {{and ease of}} setup. [...] This period also saw {{the introduction of the}} hanging or [...] "flying" [...] of main loudspeakers at large concerts. [...] During the 1980s the large speaker manufacturers started producing standard products using the innovations of the 1970s. [...] These were mostly smaller two way systems with 12", 15" [...] or double 15" [...] woofers and a high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> attached to a high frequency horn. [...] The 1980s also saw the start of loudspeaker companies focused on the sound reinforcement market. [...] The 1990s saw the introduction of Line arrays, where long vertical arrays of loudspeakers with a smaller cabinet are used to increase efficiency and provide even dispersion and frequency response. [...] This period also saw the introduction of inexpensive molded plastic speaker enclosures mounted on tripod stands. [...] Many feature built-in power amplifiers which made them practical for non-professionals to set up and operate successfully. [...] The sound quality available from these simple 'powered speakers' varies widely depending on the implementation.|$|E
2500|$|To {{adequately}} reproduce a {{wide range}} of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher sound pressure level or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named subwoofers (for very low frequencies); woofers (low frequencies); mid-range speakers (middle frequencies); tweeters (high frequencies); and sometimes supertweeters, optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls upon the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation [...] "tweeter" [...] for the high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver,</b> while professional concert systems may designate them as [...] "HF" [...] or [...] "highs". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a [...] "filter network", called a crossover, separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with n separate frequency bands is described as [...] "n-way speakers": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker driver of the type pictured are termed [...] "dynamic" [...] (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., moving iron speaker), or speakers using piezoelectric or electrostatic systems, or any of several other sorts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, Ralph D. Heinz of Renkus-Heinz {{received}} a patent for a multiple entry horn which incorporated multiple drivers for two bandpasses, high and mid, whose sound waves all exited {{into a single}} horn but at differing distances depending on the bandpass. It was marketed as the [...] "CoEntrant" [...] horn. The mid- and high-frequency drivers in the Renkus-Heinz ST/STX product line both exited through a [...] "Complex Conic" [...] waveguide. In the late 1990s, Thomas J. [...] "Tom" [...] Danley of Sound Physics Labs (also known as [...] "Servodrive") began working on a three-way multiple entry horn, bringing the SPL-td1 to market in 2000. The design used seven drivers, with one high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> at the horn's throat, four mid-frequency drivers near the throat and two low frequency drivers ported closer to the horn mouth. In 2001, Tom Danley began developing the [...] "Unity" [...] horn for Yorkville Sound, patenting the improvement in 2002. Following the 2003 release of Yorkville's Unity line, Danley formed Danley Sound Labs and developed a significant improvement over the SPL-td1 called the [...] "Synergy" [...] horn, yielding substantially better phase and magnitude response along with smoother polar pattern. The synergy horn design promises greater power output achieved from a smaller loudspeaker enclosure. Because the design retains pattern control through its crossover regions and over a large range of its total bandwidth, and because the acoustic center of the design is near {{the rear of the}} enclosure, it is more easily combined in arrays for public address applications.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1943 {{introduction}} of the Altec Lansing Duplex 601 coaxial driver, recording studio monitors have often been coaxial loudspeaker designs. In 1945 the improved Altec 604 was introduced, and it soon became the recording industry standard studio monitor in the U.S. First shown in 1947 in England, the Tannoy Dual Concentric design assumed the same role across Europe from the 1950s onward. The Altec 604 combined a 15 in woofer with a compression driver attached to a horn to carry the high frequencies. The Tannoy also used a 15-inch woofer and a compression driver for high frequencies, but differed in that the woofer itself served as the final horn flare for the high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver.</b> Thus, its output pattern was radially symmetric, not just mirror-image symmetric as in the Altec. Both designs placed the high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> behind the low <b>frequency</b> <b>driver,</b> and both were not initially time aligned. The high frequencies arrived at the listener's ear slightly later than the low frequencies.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} on the transmission line enclosure uses a tapered tube, with the terminus (opening/port) having a smaller area than the throat.

5000|$|Second-order filters have a 40 dB/decade (or 12 dB/octave) slope. Second-order filters {{can have}} a Bessel, Linkwitz-Riley or Butterworth {{characteristic}} depending on design choices and the components used. This order is commonly used in passive crossovers as it offers a reasonable balance between complexity, response, and higher <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> protection.

50|$|The early {{products}} were revised and enhanced over {{time with the}} addition of rubberized speaker surrounds and other modern features.

40|$|The ideal {{number and}} {{placement}} of low <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers</b> in small listening rooms has been controversial. Most research has assumed listener satisfaction {{is determined by}} the sound pressure as a function of frequency and source-listener position. We believe two additional properties of the soundfield, externalization and envelopment, contribute to listener preference. We propose mathematical methods for quantifying these two perceptual properties given a measured or calculated binaural impulse response. The Average Interaural Time Difference (AITD) is our measure for externalization, and the Diffuse Field Transfer function (DFT) is our measure for envelopment. An image model for small rectangular rooms is used to predict the values of pressure, AITD, and DFT for different room properties and driver locations. It is found that the low frequency pressure uniformity, the AITD, and the DFT can be increased in the prime listening area by using multiple low <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers</b> [...] especially at [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Floor {{monitors}} are compact speakers with an angled {{back that}} is {{laid on the}} floor. This angled shape gives the floor monitor its other name of wedge.

50|$|In 1995, Jerry Harvey was Van Halen's touring monitor engineer, mixing their stage sound through stage wedges—powerful {{loudspeakers}} {{aiming at}} each of the musicians. Drummer Alex Van Halen had great difficulty hearing the other band members over all the noise of the stage; louder monitors did not help. Harvey created a custom molded earpiece for the drummer to block some of the stage noise and focus on the desired sound: a prototype earpiece that contained two tiny speaker drivers, one for low frequencies and one for high frequencies, the frequencies split by a passive audio crossover. The high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> was a stock Japanese component but a suitable low <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> was difficult to find. The only driver which survived strong kick drum signals was a Knowles-made pacemaker part, a balanced armature transducer intended to warn the pacemaker wearer of internal problems. Other Van Halen band members became interested and Harvey crafted further sets. The musicians touring with Van Halen—Skid Row—wanted some in-ear monitors and Harvey sold them six pairs for $3,000. Pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck wanted a set and at that point Harvey determined to start a company to supply the demand.|$|E
50|$|Before joining Renkus-Heinz in late 1979, Jonas Renkus {{had helped}} found Emilar Corporation in 1974.

50|$|Beyond the Zmin {{point the}} {{impedance}} is again largely inductive {{and continues to}} rise gradually. The frequency Fs and the frequencies above and below it where the impedance is Zmax/√2 are important in determining the loudspeakers T/S parameters {{which can be used}} to design a suitable enclosure for the driver, especially for low <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers.</b> Note that Fs is itself one of the T/S parameters of the loudspeaker.|$|R
5000|$|Excursion {{is defined}} as how far the cone of a speaker linearly travels from its resting position. In general lower <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers</b> or subwoofers are {{designed}} to move more air and have more excursion than those of higher frequency. If a speaker is pushed beyond its limits, overexcursion, or [...] "bottoming out", can occur as the voice coil either slips out of the magnetic gap or hits the bottom of it.|$|R
5000|$|Sound Blaster Roar is a {{portable}} Bluetooth speaker manufactured by [...] Creative Technology Ltd. The speaker was launched on 27 February 2014 at the IT Show 2014 in Singapore. It has got two amplifiers one for driving the low and medium frequency {{and the other}} for high frequency. There are five drivers in the speaker, one 2.5" [...] woofer, two [...] passive radiators and two front 1.5” high <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{multiple}} entry horn (also {{known as a}} coentrant horn, unity horn or synergy horn) uses several different drivers mounted on the horn at stepped distances from the horn's apex, where the high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> is placed. Depending on implementation, this design offers an improvement in transient response as each of the drivers is aligned in phase and time and exits the same horn mouth. A more uniform radiation pattern throughout the frequency range is also possible. A uniform pattern allows smooth arraying of multiple enclosures.|$|E
50|$|Electrostatics are {{inherently}} dipole radiators {{and due to}} the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers.

50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought that there}} will always be a phase difference of 180° between the outputs of a (second order) low-pass filter and a high-pass filter having the same crossover frequency. And so, in a 2-way system, the high-pass section's output is usually connected to the high <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> 'inverted', to correct for this phase problem. For passive systems, the tweeter is wired with opposite polarity to the woofer; for active crossovers the high-pass filter's output is inverted. In 3-way systems the mid-range driver or filter is inverted. However, this is generally only true when the speakers have a wide response overlap and the acoustic centers are physically aligned.|$|E
5000|$|Mid-range {{drivers are}} usually used in three way multi driver speaker systems. There are {{therefore}} special considerations {{involved in the}} acoustic join between the mid-range and both the low frequency (woofers) and the high <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers</b> (tweeters). The nature of the drivers {{on both sides of}} the mid-range, and the mid-range itself affect the selection of crossover frequency and slope. Nearly all crossovers are passive circuits, designed to match the characteristics of the drivers and their mounting, and are built of capacitors, inductors, and resistors. Active or 'electronic' crossovers are used in some high performance hi-fi speakers, and in professional sound reinforcement systems.|$|R
5000|$|Tweeters {{designed}} for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters, though they're usually not {{referred to as}} tweeters, but as [...] "high frequency drivers". Key design requirement differences are: mountings built for repeated shipping and handling, drivers often mounted to horn structures to provide for higher sound levels and greater control of sound dispersion, and more robust voice coils to withstand the higher power levels typically encountered. High <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers</b> in PA horns are {{often referred to as}} [...] "compression drivers" [...] from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat.|$|R
50|$|Speaker drivers may be {{designed}} to operate within a broad or narrow frequency range. Small diaphragms are not well suited to moving the large volume of air that is required for satisfying low frequency response. Conversely, large drivers may have heavy voice coils and cones that limit their ability to move at very high <b>frequencies.</b> <b>Drivers</b> pressed beyond their design limits may have high distortion. In a multi-way loudspeaker system, specialized drivers are provided to produce specific frequency ranges, and the incoming signal is split by a crossover. Drivers can be sub-categorized into several types: full-range, tweeters, super tweeters, mid-range drivers, woofers, and subwoofers.|$|R
5000|$|In bi-wiring, each {{loudspeaker}} has {{two pairs}} of connectors and two cables are run from the same amplifier output to the speaker cabinet - one for the high frequency or tweeter driver {{and one for the}} low <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> (through two separated crossover filters). The purported advantage of this split is that it [...] "reduces magnetic interaction in the cable, resulting in better sound". [...] Some audiophiles feel that bi-wiring produces an audible improvement over standard single cabling. For example, John Atkinson, writing in Stereophile, states that he observes [...] "subtle but important" [...] differences, particularly in reduction of treble hardness and improvement in bass control in one review.|$|E
50|$|Large-format line arrays are {{designed}} for large venues or outdoor festivals. These boxes typically included multiple vertically aligned high frequency compression drivers and multiple midrange and low drivers arranged symmetrically around the compression driver. The low <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> is typically 15 or 18 inches in diameter. Mid-format line arrays are typically two or three way and use 10 or 12 inch low-frequency drivers. The horizontal coverage is typically 90 degrees wide but some systems employ narrower boxes at the top or wider boxes {{at the bottom of}} the array. Using a transition frame (which aligns the rigging on dissimilar systems), system engineers may sometimes hang a mid-format box below a large-format box to cover the closest audience members. Speaker boxes from different manufacturers are not mixed because each system has a particular 'voicing' which may be common to a single manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|Damping factor : A {{higher number}} is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} better. This {{is a measure of}} how well a power amplifier controls the undesired motion of a loudspeaker driver. An amplifier must be able to suppress resonances caused by mechanical motion (e.g., inertia) of a speaker cone, especially a low <b>frequency</b> <b>driver</b> with greater mass. For conventional loudspeaker drivers, this essentially involves ensuring that the output impedance of the amplifier is close to zero and that the speaker wires are sufficiently short and have sufficiently large diameter. Damping factor is the ratio of the output impedance of an amplifier and connecting cables to the DC resistance of a voice coil, which means that long, high resistance speaker wires will reduce the damping factor. A damping factor of 20 or greater is considered adequate for live sound reinforcement systems, as the SPL of inertia-related driver movement is 26 dB less than signal level and won't be heard. Negative feedback in an amplifier lowers its effective output impedance and thus increases its damping factor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>frequency</b> of <b>driver</b> updates {{increased}} in late 2004, releasing Linux drivers every two months, half {{as often as}} their Windows counterparts. Then since late 2005 this has been increased to monthly releases, inline with the Windows Catalyst releases.|$|R
25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{are frequently}} used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they {{are resistant to}} overloads that would normally destroy most high <b>frequency</b> <b>drivers,</b> {{and they can be}} used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLifetime {{experiments}} {{show that}} sodium scandium {{metal halide lamps}} perform better on VHF (Very High <b>Frequency)</b> <b>drivers</b> than on LF (Low Frequency) CWA ballasts. The question why, will be addressed with focus on arc tube aspects. It is argued that at high frequency operation sodium loss is less, and {{that the absence of}} thermal fluctuations in the electrode tip causes less damage and cracking to this part of the electrode. Sudden lm/W drops, observed with CWA-operated lamps, most probably occur when the arc attaches on such a corroded and cracked surface. Thorium is effective as an emitter both in the CWA and the VHF operation mode, despite the absence of cataphoretic transport to the cathode in the VHF case...|$|R
