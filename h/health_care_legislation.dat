5|$|Fletcher {{graduated}} from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut. He left the Air Force after budget cuts reduced his squadron's flying time and {{earned a degree in}} medicine, hoping to earn a spot as a civilian on a space mission. Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1994. Two years later he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent Scotty Baesler.

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} for KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack {{by only one}} point, 47 to 46 percent.

In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored {{one of the biggest}} upsets in Minnesota political history, defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent. Cravaack believed the abortion issue was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>legislation</b> that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the payment of abortions with taxpayer funds, and encouraged euthanasia for the elderly. By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of socialized medicine that will result in the rationing of medical care.|$|E

Konop ran to the right of Price on immigration policy and criticized Price's support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He also argued that Price's support for transportation and energy bills would increase the federal deficit. Price defended these bills, arguing that the former would return more tax-payer money to Georgia and that the latter could potentially help the United States achieve energy independence. Price raised $1.5 million throughout the primary campaign, while Konop merely raised around $50,000. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution endorsed Price in the primary election, suggesting that Price could {{play an important role in}} shaping future <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>legislation.</b> A televised debate between the candidates was held on July 7, 2006, and the election was then held on July 18.

[...] In November 2009, when asked about how she came up with the term [...] "death panels," [...] Palin said, [...] "To me, while reading that section of the bill, it became so evident {{that there would be a}} panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage. Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care.

[...] Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote of the bill, [...] "it's {{good to have a}} fleshed out plan, because it helps clarify the differences between the parties on health reform." [...] Sargent also wrote that [...] "GOP reforms would likely translate into lower-quality plans and a coverage expansion that would benefit fewer people. But that would be the trade-off Republicans would make to achieve their goal of less government spending and interference in the market than that which occurs under Obamacare." [...] In 2017, after Price was nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, NPR wrote that Price's 2015 bill would be seen as [...] "one of the main paths forward to repeal portions of the ACA." ...|$|E
