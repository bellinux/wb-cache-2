40|$|The {{type and}} variety of {{learning}} strategies used by individuals to acquire behaviours in the wild are poorly understood, {{despite the presence of}} behavioural traditions in diverse taxa. Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like pay-off-biased learning, by contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food <b>item</b> <b>and</b> <b>documented</b> the innovation <b>and</b> diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that pay-off-biased and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population...|$|R

5000|$|Fiona Sinnott, 19, of Rosslare, Co. Wexford, {{went missing}} on February 8, 1998. She {{was living in}} Broadway, Co. Wexford. Fiona was last seen leaving Butler's Pub, Broadway, Co. Wexford. She left the pub with her ex-boyfriend and father to her 11-month-old daughter, Sean Carroll. During his {{conversation}} with investigators, Carroll told them that he had walked Sinnott back to her house in Ballyhitt, Wexford {{and that he had}} spent the night sleeping on her couch. Sinnott, who had been complaining of pains in her arm and upper body, had gone straight to bed and that the next morning, on Monday, February 9th, Carroll said that he walked into Sinnott's bedroom and saw that she was awake. According to Carroll, Sinnott had told him that she was still in pain and that she had intended on hitching a lift to her GP later that day. Because Sinnott said that she had no money, Carroll told Gardai that he had given her £3. He then left the house and took a lift from his mother, who was waiting in a car outside. Carroll and his mother then drove back to their family home, which was where Sinnott and Carroll’s daughter Emma had been staying at the time. Sinnott was never seen again. During the investigation into Sinnott’s disappearance, it was discovered that she did not see a doctor that day (there were no records of her having visited any of the surgeries in the vicinity). The investigation also failed to find any evidence that she had been thumbing for a lift. During a technical examination of Sinnott’s house, Gardai noticed that it had been stripped bare of a number of her personal belongings. According to retired detective sergeant Alan Bailey, there was a [...] "complete absence of clothing and other personal items indicating that a teenage girl and her eleven-month-old daughter were actually living there." [...] Later, locals would report that they had seen a number of black refuse bags outside of the property. As news of Sinnott’s disappearance continued to spread, a local farmer approached Gardai with news that he had discovered a number of black bags in the corner of one of his fields. Inside, he had found a number of <b>items</b> <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> that had Sinnott’s name written on them. Unfortunately, the farmer had set fire to these bags as he initially thought that it was just another case of illegal dumping. It wasn’t until news of Sinnott’s disappearance reached him that he realised how significant they were. It was at this point that investigators began to suspect that somebody was trying to mislead them into thinking that Sinnott had run away. On September 12, 2008, a memorial plaque for Sinnott was stolen from a cemetery in Our Lady’s Island in Wexford. The marble plaque, which had been cemented into the wall, was removed the night before it was due to be unveiled.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the work of Peace Corps volunteers in South America during the 1960 s. It argues that through their training in impoverished communities in the United States and their intervention in similar contexts in South America, these volunteers connected diverse visions of community action aimed at eradicating poverty. This allows an inclusion of a historical comprehension of the Peace Corps within the scenario of a Global War on Poverty. The argument derives from the analysis of letters <b>and</b> testimonies, press <b>items,</b> <b>and</b> official <b>documents</b> found in archives and libraries both in the United States and South America...|$|R
40|$|Personalization {{has proven}} to be a useful method in helping users find {{relevant}} <b>items</b> <b>and</b> <b>documents.</b> More and more digital stores implement some form of personalization to help users find products. Even though there are a lot of work in the field of personalization and recommender systems, search engines are only personalized to a limited degree. In this work, we investigate how to develop a personalized search engine, which gives instant product suggestions to the user based on user preferences and queries. As part of this, we implement and test our methods based on Bayesian classification and Kullback-Leibler divergence. In addition, we compare these methods with the baseline methods used today. Our experiments and user-based evaluation show promising results with respect to the relevance of the personalized suggestions and interactiveness. Overall, this research found that our approach is able to retrieve personalized suggestions instantly, even for products not directly containing typed terms. We expect our method to be useful for digital stores, in general...|$|E
40|$|As {{material}} based researchers we are deliberately {{bypassing the}} digital archive catalogue to directly access physical material. We {{are interested in}} what is lost of the materiality through the digital? By presenting our ongoing research (Bummock: New Artistic Responses to Unseen Parts of Archives) in this symposium we seek to raise questions and discuss issues about the digitised archive in this context. It is often only the important elements of archives and collections that are made public. We seek to give a platform for these stored and undervalued (or yet to be appreciated) parts. Often these are the items not on the digitized catalogue. Our project investigates, researches and uses unseen parts of archives as catalysts {{for the creation of}} new artworks. We also seek to generate new methods of access to archives for researchers based upon physical interaction. Through artists’ residencies within 5 varying archives we are investigating <b>items</b> <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> not regularly brought up for research and public exposure. The project is examining issues around how artist approach access to archives differently to standard research practice. We are interested in bypassing the digital catalogue in favour of a ‘controlled rummage’ of the materials. Through this project we are interested in developing alternative ways to access an archive, to uncover unseen things that normal routes would not allow. A projected outcome for the project is to develop and disseminate new ways for researchers to access archives. Our paper is a demonstration of this ongoing project, currently working within the Lace Archive and Tennyson Research Centre and 3 others in the future. Through it we will explore aspects, such as how much of stored <b>items</b> <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> are collected but remain unseen or uncatalogued; how or what would this be in relation to the digital archival arena; and what the importance of material archives are for artistic and other research.

40|$|This paper motivates and {{describes}} GALE, the Generic Adaptation Language and Engine {{that came out}} of the GRAPPLE EU FP 7 project. The main focus of the paper is the extensible nature of GALE. The purpose of this description is to illustrate how a single core adaptation engine can be used for different types of adaptation, applied to different types of information <b>items</b> <b>and</b> <b>documents.</b> We illustrate the adaptive functionality on some examples of hypermedia documents. In April 2012, David Smits defended the world's first adaptive PhD thesis on this topic. The thesis, available for download and direct adaptive access at [URL] shows that a single source of information can serve different audiences and at the same time also allows more freedom of navigation than is possible in any paper or static hypermedia document. The same can be done for course texts, hyperfiction, encyclopedia, museum, or other cultural heritage websites, etc. We explain how to add functionality to GALE if desired, to adapt the system's behavior to whatever the application requires. This stresses our main objective: to provide a technological base for adaptive (hypermedia) system researchers on which they can build extensions for the specific research they have in mind.
