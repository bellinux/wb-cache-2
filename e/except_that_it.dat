5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is in a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It {{is about the same}} size as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not for the intended purpose, and {{the government}} has failed to honour requests to return the money.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Purdue, he met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics. According to the couple, {{there was no}} real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley. Janet never finished her degree, a fact she regretted later in life.|$|E

60|$|Years passed away, {{and with}} them many old things vanished, while many {{novelties}} appeared, but the Red Brigade remained much as <b>it</b> was, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was, if possible, smarter and more energetic than ever.|$|R
5|$|The 1982-dated issues {{banknotes}} differed {{little from}} the earlier, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{took into account}} of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare. However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote (Pick no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as {{the name of the}} capital city instead of Harare. These type of issues are rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
