40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{adhesion}} is {{an important}} determinant of colonization and infection, including dental caries. The salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein gp- 340, which mediates adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (implicated in caries), harbours three major size variants, designated gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> to III, each specific to an individual saliva. Here we have examined the association of the gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> to III polymorphisms with caries experience and adhesion of S. mutans. Methods A case-referent study was performed in 12 -year-old Swedish children with high (n = 19) or low (n = 19) caries experiences. We measured the gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> to III saliva phenotypes and correlated those with multiple outcome measures for caries experience and saliva adhesion of S. mutans using the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate projection technique. In addition, we used traditional statistics and 2 -year caries increment to verify the established PLS associations, and bacterial adhesion to purified gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> to III proteins to support possible mechanisms. Results All except one subject were typed as gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> to III (10, 23 and 4, respectively). The gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> phenotype correlated positively with caries experience (VIP = 1. 37) and saliva adhesion of S. mutans Ingbritt (VIP = 1. 47). The gp- 340 II and III phenotypes tended to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, the gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> phenotype tended to show an increased 2 -year caries increment compared to phenotypes II/III. Purified gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> protein mediated markedly higher adhesion of S. mutans strains Ingbritt and NG 8 and Lactococcus lactis expressing AgI/II adhesins (SpaP or PAc) compared to gp- 340 II and III proteins. In addition, the gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> protein appeared over represented in subjects positive for Db, an allelic acidic PRP variant associated with caries, and subjects positive for both gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> and Db tended to experience more caries than those negative for both proteins. Conclusion Gp- <b>340</b> <b>I</b> behaves as a caries susceptibility protein. </p...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{stimulation}} by odorants, Ca 2 + and Na+ {{enter the}} cilia of olfactory sensory neurons through channels directly gated by cAMP. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels {{have been found}} in a variety of cells and extensively investigated in the past few years. Glutamate residues at position 363 of the alpha subunit of the bovine retinal rod channel have previously been shown to constitute a cation-binding site important for blockage by external divalent cations and to control single-channel properties. It has therefore been assumed, but not proven, that glutamate residues at the corresponding position of the other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels play a similar role. We studied the corresponding glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>340)</b> of the alpha subunit of the bovine olfactory channel to determine its role in channel gating and in permeation and blockage by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. <b>E</b> <b>340</b> was mutated into either an aspartate, glycine, glutamine, or asparagine residue and properties of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were measured in excised patches. By single-channel recordings, we demonstrated that the open probabilities in the presence of cGMP or cAMP were decreased by the mutations, with a larger decrease observed on gating by cAMP. Moreover, we observed that the mutant <b>E</b> <b>340</b> N presented two conductance levels. We found that both external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + powerfully blocked the current in wild-type and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> D mutants, whereas their blockage efficacy was drastically reduced when the glutamate charge was neutralized. The inward current carried by external Ca 2 + relative to Na+ was larger in the <b>E</b> <b>340</b> G mutant compared with wild-type channels. In conclusion, we have confirmed that the residue at position <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of the bovine olfactory CNG channel is in the pore region, controls permeation and blockage by external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and affects channel gating by cAMP more than by cGMP...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} properties of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from Rough Sike, a stream draining blanket peat in the northern Pennines, UK, were investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays. Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003 - 2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid {{was used as a}} quality control standard in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a) pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20 - 23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. Analysis of these data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at <b>340</b> nm (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> while good quadratic relationships exist between <b>E</b> <b>340</b> and both buffering capacity and fluorescence.

40|$|Comparative {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in its empty {{as well as}} agonist(i. e. active) and antagonist-bound (i. e. nonactive) forms have been carried out. The agonists 5 -HT and (R) - 8 -OH-DPAT {{as well as the}} antagonist WAY 100635 have been employed. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the receptor portions close to the E/DRY/W motif, with prominence to the cytosolic extensions of helices 3 and 6, are particularly susceptible to undergo structural modification in response to agonist binding. Despite the differences in the structural/dynamics behavior of the two agonists when docked into the 5 -HT 1 A receptor, they both exert a destabilization of the intrahelical and interhelical interactions found in the empty and antagonist-bound receptor forms between the arginine of the E/DRY sequence and both D 133 (3. 49) and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). For both agonists, the chemical information transfer from the extracellular to the cytosolic domains is mediated by a cluster of aromatic amino acids in helix 61 following the ligand interaction with selected amino acids in the extracellular half of the receptor, such as D 116 (3. 32), S 199 (5. 42), Y 195 (5. 38), and F 361 (6. 51). A significant reduction in the bend at P 360 (6. 50), as compared to the empty and the antagonist-bound receptor forms, is one of the features of the agonist-bound forms that is related to the breakage of the interhelical salt bridge between the E/DRY arginine and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). Another structural feature, shared by the agonist-bound receptor forms and not by the empty and antagonist-bound forms, is the detachment of helices 2 and 4, as marked by the movement of W 161 (4. 50) away from helix 2, toward the membrane space...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{regulation of}} protein trafficking by calmodulin (CaM) {{is a novel}} concept {{that remains to be}} substantiated. We proposed that KCNQ 2 K+ channel trafficking is regulated by CaM binding to the C-terminal A and B helices. Here we show that the L 339 R mutation in helix A, which is linked to human benign neonatal convulsions, perturbs CaM binding to KCNQ 2 channels and prevents their correct trafficking to the plasma membrane. We used glutathione S-transferase fused to helices A and B to examine the impact of this and other mutations in helix A (<b>I</b> <b>340</b> A, <b>I</b> <b>340</b> <b>E,</b> A 343 D, and R 353 G) on the interaction with CaM. The process appears to require at least two steps; the first involves the transient association of CaM with KCNQ 2, and in the second, the complex adopts an “active” conformation that is more stable and is that which confers the capacity to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Significantly, the mutations that we have analyzed mainly affect the stability of the active configuration of the complex, whereas Ca 2 + alone appears to affect the initial binding step. The spectrum of responses from this collection of mutants revealed a strong correlation between adopting the active conformation and channel trafficking in mammalian cells. These data are entirely consistent with the concept that CaM bound to KCNQ 2 acts as a Ca 2 + sensor, conferring Ca 2 + dependence to the trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane and fully explaining the requirement of CaM binding for KCNQ 2 function...|$|R

Activated carbon (AC) air cathodes are now frequently used in MFCs due to the low price of AC ($ 1. 4 /kg) and its good catalytic activity as AC performs similar to or better than Pt catalysts in these systems (Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014 a). Oxygen reduction is a three-phase reaction, in which protons in the solution phase and oxygen in the air phase combine together on the solid AC catalyst phase (Duteanu et al., 2010; Nie et al., o 47 % of the total ical to reduce the-scale MF a per volu the reactor) (Logan et al., 2015). In order to achieve dual g being waterproof and oxygen permeable, however, co procedures have often been used to fabricate DLs. Polytet roethylene (PTFE), a fluorinated hydrophobic polymer, is commonly applied to the air side of the cathode to produce a DL with the required hydrophobicity (Cheng and Wu, 2013; Dong et al., 2012 b). However, PTFE requires high temperature treatment (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>340</b> C) to melt the PTFE and form a uniform waterproof polymer film, which therefore results in a complex process that consumes {{a lot of energy}} for heating (Dong et al., 2012 b). A PTFE film can b...|$|R
40|$|Gaucher disease, {{the most}} common {{lysosomal}} storage disease, is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid-β-glucosidase (GlcCerase). Type 1 is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, and types 2 and 3 by early or chronic onset of severe neurological symptoms. No clear correlation exists between the ~ 200 GlcCerase mutations and disease severity, although homozygosity for the common mutations N 370 S and L 444 P is associated with nonneuronopathic and neuronopathic disease, respectively. We report the X-ray structure of GlcCerase at 2. 0 Å resolution. The catalytic domain consists of a (β/α) TIM barrel, as expected for a 8 member of the glucosidase hydrolase A clan. The distance between the catalytic residues E 235 and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> {{is consistent with a}} catalytic mechanism of retention. N 370 is located on the longest α-helix (helix 7), which has several other mutations of residues that point into the TIM barrel. Helix 7 is at the interface between the TIM barrel and a separate immunoglobulin-like domain on which L 444 is located, suggesting an important regulatory or structural role for this non-catalytic domain. The structure provides the possibility of engineering improved GlcCerase for enzyme-replacement therapy, and for designing structure-based drugs aimed at restoring the activity of defective GlcCerase.

40|$|The vials {{filled with}} Fricke {{solutions}} were doped with increasing concentrations of Photogem®, used in photodynamic therapy. These vials were then irradiated with low-energy X-rays with doses ranging from 5 to 20 Gy. The conventional Fricke solution was also irradiated {{with the same}} doses. The concentration of ferric ions for the Fricke and doped-Fricke irradiated solutions were measured in a spectrophotometer at 220 to 340 nm. The results showed {{that there was an}} enhancement in the response of the doped-Fricke solution, which was proportional to the concentration of the photosensitizer. The use of such procedure for studying the radiosensitizing property of photosensitizers based on the production of free radicals is also discussed. Tubos de ensaio foram preenchidos com a solução Fricke dopada com Fotogem® em concentrações crescentes; essa hemotoporfirina é utilizada na terapia fotodinâmica. Esses tubos foram irradiados com doses de 5 a 20 Gy. A solução Fricke convencional também foi irradiada com as mesmas doses. As concentrações de íons férricos nas soluções Fricke convencional e dopadas irradiadas foram medidas num espectrofotômetro com comprimento de onda entre 220 <b>e</b> <b>340</b> nm. Os resultados mostraram que quando comparado o Fricke convencional com o Fricke dopado irradiado, as amostras dopadas demonstraram um aumento na resposta da dose absorvida que é proporcional a concentração do Photogem® na solução Fricke. Concluímos que esse procedimento pode ser utilizado para propósitos de dosimetria na terapia com radiossensibilizadores...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRac is an {{activating}} {{factor for}} Nox 1, an O 2 −-generating NADPH oxidase, {{expressed in the}} colon and other tissues. Rac requires a GDP-GTP exchange factor for activation. Nox 1 activation by βPix has been demonstrated in cell lines. We {{examined the effects of}} βPix and its phosphomimetic mutant on endogenous Nox 1 in Caco- 2 cells transfected with Noxo 1 and Noxa 1. βPix expression enhanced O 2 − production in resting cells and cells stimulated with EGF or phorbol ester. βPix(S <b>340</b> <b>E)</b> further enhanced O 2 − production, while βPix(S 340 A) eliminated the βPix effect. βPix(S <b>340</b> <b>E),</b> but not βPix(S 340 A), had higher affinity and GEF activity for Rac than wild-type βPix. These results suggest that βPix phosphorylation at Ser- 340 upregulates Nox 1 through Rac activation, confirming Rac as a trigger for acute Nox 1 -dependent ROS production...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} a highly conserved {{aromatic}} residue, phenylalanine at the 340 -position, is essential for ergoline bind-ing to 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors. We hypothesized that F 340 was essential for a specific aromatic-aromatic interaction (e. g., ir-r or hydrophobic) between the phenyl moiety of F 340 and the aromatic ring of the ergoline nucleus. To test this hypothesis, eight point mutations of adjacent (F 340 and F 339) and nonadjacent (Fl 25) phenyalanines were made, using con-servative (phenylalanine to tyrosine) and nonconservative (phe-nylalanine to leucine, alanine, or serine) substitutions. The bind-ing affinities {{of all of the}} tested simple ergolines were greatly reduced by specific mutations of F 340 in which aromatic-aro-matic interactions (<b>e.</b> g., F <b>340</b> A and F 340 L) were abolished, but they were unaffected when the replacement residue was aro-matic (<b>e.</b> g., F <b>340</b> Y). In contrast, the binding affinities of fou...|$|R
