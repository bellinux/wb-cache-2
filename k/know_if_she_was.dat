500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E

2500|$|The main {{target of}} the Nazis was Berta Geissmar. She {{was so close to}} the {{conductor}} that she wrote in her book about Furtwängler that the Nazis had begun an investigation to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his mistress. After having harassed her for a period of two years, she moved to London when she became Sir Thomas Beecham's main assistant. In the book she wrote on Furtwängler in England in 1943, she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would like}} to see----' He could not help {{colouring}} till his cheeks rivaled the colour of his sword-knot. 'I want just to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> here. I <b>know</b> not <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> called Madame or Mademoiselle de Ribaumont.' ...|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> not <b>known</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned}} a pennant number as no record has been found.|$|R
60|$|I want to <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> pulling strings {{to get him}} moved I suppose it's {{for some}} reason. He was very {{comfortable}} here. It's not often you find a secretary who exactly suits you.|$|R
60|$|Yes, Mrs. Soames was in, but {{the maid}} did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> seeing people.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} see Sara Beaumont to tell Frances about her, but I couldn't {{get a glimpse of}} her. I don't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} Toller's cottage, I was distressed (but hardly surprised) to {{hear that}} Cristel, exhausted after a wakeful night, still kept her bed, {{in the hope of}} getting some sleep. I was so anxious to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> at rest, that her father went upstairs to look at her.|$|E
50|$|Tetra's {{expression}} {{clearly shows}} what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> thinking, which the narrator appreciates because it lets him <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> following his explanations. She uses exaggerated gestures, frequently making the narrator wish {{that she would}} calm down.|$|R
6000|$|... "June! {{this is not}} a fit {{subject for}} a girl who {{scarcely}} <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> to live another hour or not. I would obtain some signs of my dear uncle's being alive and safe, if possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|They ran in, {{apparently}} on excellent {{terms with}} her, and greeted her guest without shyness; {{but after a}} little whispering and shoving the youngest spoke. 'Edie and Reggie want to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the lady that put out the light?' ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not come}} one morning, but sent her brother, who only laughed, and said Marie had hurt her foot, when we inquired for her. Anxious to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> really ill, {{we went to see}} her in the afternoon, and heard a pretty little story of {{practical}} Christianity.|$|E
60|$|What made {{me think}} {{directly}} of Miss Staveley? What made me mad to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the charming girl? I was bold enough to ask the question. Mrs. Staveley turned to me with that mischievous look which I have noticed already. I felt as if I had been running {{at the top of}} my speed, and had not got my breath again, yet.|$|E
60|$|From that hour, at least, {{began the}} siege of Mrs. Henry; a thing so deftly carried on that I scarce <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> aware of it herself, and that her husband must look on in silence. The first {{parallel}} was opened (as was made to appear) by accident. The talk fell, as it did often, on the exiles in France; so it glided to the matter of their songs.|$|E
60|$|August 3.--Caroline's {{forgetfulness}} of her pony has naturally enough {{extended to}} me, her sister. It is ten days since she last wrote, and {{but for a}} note from my mother I should not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> dead or alive.|$|R
50|$|The continuity-altering {{effects of}} 52 and Infinite Crisis {{resulted}} in a new multiverse. A new Dark Angel has appeared, although it <b>is</b> not yet <b>known</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a multiversal counterpart to Donna Troy or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has a different origin altogether.|$|R
50|$|The team {{begins to}} work on {{diagnosing}} Margo's new symptoms. House suspects the fertility treatments caused endometrial cancer. On the roof, Stacy meets with House. He wants to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> going to tell Mark about their affair, but she stalls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a farthing of it, sir. She {{said she}} would never be beholden to Catherick for bit or drop, if she lived to be a hundred. And she has kept her word ever since. When my poor dear husband died, and left all to me, Catherick's letter was put in my {{possession}} with the other things, and I told her to let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ever in want. 'I'll let all England know I'm in want,' she said, 'before I tell Catherick, or any friend of Catherick's. Take that for your answer, and give it to HIM for an answer, if he ever writes again.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very little," [...] {{replied the}} housekeeper. [...] "She talked principally of Sir Percival, and asked {{a great many}} {{questions}} about {{where he had been}} travelling, and what sort of lady his new wife was. She seemed to be more soured and put out than distressed, by failing to find any traces of her daughter in these parts. 'I give her up,' were the last words she said that I can remember; 'I give her up, ma'am, for lost.' And from that she passed at once to her questions about Lady Glyde, wanting to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a handsome, amiable lady, comely and healthy and young----Ah, dear! I thought how it would end. Look, Miss Halcombe, the poor thing is out of its misery at last!" ...|$|E
60|$|After a time, Laura Stannard {{crossed the}} veranda and went along the terrace. Her white dress was fashionable {{and she wore}} a big white hat. Her hair and eyes were black, her figure was {{gracefully}} slender, and her carriage was good. Jimmy thought her strangely attractive, but did not altogether <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his friend, and admitted {{that he was not}} Laura's sort. It was not that she was proud. Something about her indicated that her proper background was an old-fashioned English country house; Jimmy felt his was a Lancashire cotton mill. Laura did not live with Stannard, but she joined him and Jimmy in Switzerland not long before they started for Canada. Stannard was jealous about his daughter and had indicated that his friends were not necessarily hers. Jimmy had grounds to think Stannard's caution justified.|$|E
50|$|The {{date and}} {{circumstances}} {{of her death}} are unconfirmed. In 1532, a woman was detained in a prison in the Netherlands, who {{is believed to have}} been Sigbrit. The emperor wished to have this prisoner executed for witchcraft. It <b>is</b> not <b>known</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|FENWICK. Yes, sir, afraid. You know her, you <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> worthy; and {{you answer}} me with--the world: {{the world which}} has been at your feet: the world which Mr. Austin knows so well how to value and is so able to rule.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Miss March should {{agree to}} come," [...] she said, [...] "it might be {{pleasant}} {{for you to}} make one of her party and ride over at the same time. However, I'll let you <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> coming, and then you can join her or not, as suits your convenience." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she urged}} the horse. It {{was a long}} drive to the {{settlement}} where she had kept the hotel, and {{she had not been}} there for some time. The goods she and her neighbors bought came from the new settlement on the railroad, which was not far off; but she had an object in visiting the other. It was noon when she reached the hotel and sat down to dinner in the familiar room. She did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pleased or disappointed to find the meal served as well as before, but her thoughts were not cheerful while she ate. She remembered her ambitions and her resolve to leave the dreary plains and make her mark in Toronto or Montreal. Now her dreams had vanished and she must grapple with dull realities that jarred her worse than they had done.|$|E
60|$|An angel {{looking down}} upon earth through the lilies of Heaven--that was the rather absurd thought which flashed into my mind. I {{did not quite}} realise her face at first except {{that it seemed to}} be both dark and fair; as a fact her waving hair which grew rather low upon her forehead, was dark, and her large, soft eyes were grey. I did not know, and to this moment I do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> really beautiful, but {{certainly}} the light that shone through those eyes of hers and seemed to be reflected upon her delicate features, was beauty itself. It was like that glowing through a thin vase of the purest alabaster within which a lamp is placed, and I felt this effect to arise from no chance, like that of the lily-setting, but, as it were, from the lamp of the spirit within.|$|E
6000|$|Philammon looked round for the negress, {{but she had}} vanished. He was far {{too much}} ashamed of being {{known to have been}} alone with a woman to say {{anything}} about her. Yet he longed to see her again; an interest--even something like an affection--had already sprung up in his heart toward the poor simple creature whom he had delivered from death. Instead of thinking her ungrateful for not staying to tell what he had done for her, he was thankful to her for having saved his blushes, by disappearing so opportunely.... And he longed to tell her so--to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> hurt--to--Oh, Philammon! only four days from the Laura, and a whole regiment of women acquaintances already! True, Providence having sent into the world about as many women as men, it maybe difficult to keep out of their way altogether. Perhaps, too, Providence may have intended them to be of some use to that other sex, with whom it has so mixed them up. Don't argue, poor Philammon; Alexander's church is on fire!-forward! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None of them," [...] she replied. [...] "He {{went away}} two hours since on foot. As I {{understood}} it, his object {{was to make}} fresh inquiries about the woman named Anne Catherick. He appears to be unreasonably anxious about tracing her. Do you happen to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dangerously mad, Miss Halcombe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Jennie,' he said, 'my {{wife said}} Duane {{came here to}} see you. I believe she's lyin'.

6000|$|... "Isobel--the Princess Isobel, if you like--has been lured {{from our}} care by a forged message.

I want to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in this house." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{a muffled}} clamour made itself {{heard from the}} depths of the dining-room, like that noise of voices which is heard behind the scenes at the theatre when an armed mob is about to burst upon the stage. Irish tones, high, windy, and angry, yells, and oaths defined themselves, and Mrs. Harmon came obesely hurrying from the dining- room toward the office, closely {{followed}} by Jerry, the porter. When upon duty, or, as some of the boarders contended, when in the right humour, he blacked the boots, and made the hard-coal fires, and carried the trunks up and down stairs. When in the wrong humour, he had sometimes been heard to swear at Mrs. Harmon, but she had excused him in this eccentricity because, she said, he had been with her so long. Those who excused it with her on these grounds conjectured arrears of wages as another reason for her patience. His outbreaks of bad temper had the Celtic uncertainty; the most innocent touch excited them, as sometimes the broadest snub failed to do so; and no one could foretell what direction his zigzag fury would take. He had disliked Lemuel from the first, and had chafed at the subordination into which he had necessarily fallen. He was now yelling after Mrs. Harmon, to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not satisfied with wan gutther-snoipe, that she must nades go and pick up another, and whether the new wan was going to be too good to take prisints of money for his worruk from the boarthers, and put {{all the rest of the}} help under the caumpliment of refusin' ut, or else demanin' themselves by takin' ut? If this was the case, he'd have her to know that she couldn't kape anny other help; and the quicker she found it out the betther. Mrs. Harmon was trying to appease him by promising to see Lemuel at once, and ask him about it.|$|E
50|$|Some {{time after}} the death of her father in 7 BCE, Mariamne III was betrothed to Antipater II, her uncle and the eldest son of King Herod. After Antipater's {{execution}} in 4 BCE, an anonymous Mariamne was the first wife of another uncle, Herod Archelaus, ethnarch of Judea but nothing permits to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Mariamne III.|$|E
