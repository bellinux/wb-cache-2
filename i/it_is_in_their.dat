5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity and if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini {{sought out}} in Europe's monastic {{libraries}} the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of Antiquity, while the Fall of Constantinople (1453) generated {{a wave of}} émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{meaningful}} {{monitoring system}} for the sector goals. The sector goals concerning access to drinking water and sanitation are not {{defined in terms of}} the definition of the UN's Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, which is considered too loose, but in terms of a more narrow definition of access. There is a large number of performance criteria, but there are no baseline data and no methodology for monitoring. There may even be a disincentive for provinces to improve their monitoring systems, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> interest to show that their access figures are low and that they are in need of more central funds.|$|E
50|$|Although the Smurfs play a {{major part}} in the film, they do not appear until 35 minutes into the film.

25|$|Strong views {{among the}} {{population}} in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.|$|R
50|$|According to Heywood, women {{needed to}} realize that they too were allowed to derive {{pleasure}} from sex. In some ways, however, Heywood did subscribe to the gender stereotypes of the time. For example, even though she believed that women could feel sexual “passion,” she did not think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> nature to consider the possibility of sex without love, whereas men were likely to do this.|$|R
25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
500|$|Despite his slave origin, Bajkam {{was educated}} in Arabic (although he {{reportedly}} {{did not speak}} it for fear of making mistakes), respected by intellectuals and was known to seek the company of such men as al-Suli and the physician Sinan ibn Thabit. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> writings that glimpses of his character survive. According to the researcher Marius Canard, Bajkam was [...] "covetous of power and money, he {{did not hesitate to}} resort to dissimulation and ruse, corruption and torture to attain his ends; he was at times cruel, though his bravery was legendary, and was more upright in character than Ibn Ra'iq". Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.|$|E

Regarding the Nashville Sound, Porter {{believed that it was}} in the people who were involved: Hank Garland, Ray Edenton, Buddy Harman, Harold Bradley, Bob Moore, Boots Randolph, Floyd Cramer, Velma Smith, Charlie McCoy, the Anita Kerr Singers, and the Jordanaires. He said, [...] "They play perfectly together because they were like family. They did it without thinking!... They played methodical yet simple rhythm patterns or fills. It was almost a jazz concept from the standpoint that a lot of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> head. If you listen to Hank Garland, you won't hear the same lick twice." ...|$|E

50|$|Although Colombia {{has many}} laws against {{domestic}} violence, under specific legislation, and also under the Penal Code, {{the public opinion}} continues to see domestic violence as something private, that must be solved without legal punishment: a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.|$|R
2500|$|Corporations may rely on {{borrowed}} funds (debt capital or credit) {{as sources}} of investment to sustain ongoing business operations or to fund future growth. [...] Debt comes in several forms, such as through bank loans, notes payable, or bonds issued to the public. [...] Bonds require the corporations to make regular interest payments (interest expenses) on the borrowed capital until the debt reaches its maturity date, therein the firm must pay back the obligation in full. [...] Debt payments can also {{be made in the}} form of sinking fund provisions, whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above regular interest charges. [...] Corporations that issue callable bonds are entitled to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> best interest to pay off the debt payments. [...] If interest expenses cannot be made by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use collateral assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of liquidation).|$|E
2500|$|The State Bar of Arizona {{appealed to}} {{a desire to}} {{maintain}} a certain air of [...] "professionalism" [...] among lawyers as justifying its ban on lawyer advertising. [...] Advertising, the State Bar asserted, would [...] "undermine the attorney's sense of dignity and self-worth", [...] "erode the client's trust in the attorney" [...] by exposing an economic motive for representation, and [...] "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession". But the public understands that attorneys make their living at the bar, and few attorneys deceive themselves by thinking otherwise. [...] "Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. [...] In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession." [...] A lack of information about the price of legal services tends to dissuade people of modest means from seeking legal representation, even when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> best interest to engage such representation. [...] Finally, insofar as the [...] "belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism, the historical foundation for the advertising restraint has crumbled." ...|$|E
