40|$|Background: After total laryngectomy, the {{interruption}} {{of the upper}} digestive tube and {{the section of the}} cricopharyngeal segment alter the high-pressure zone of the pharyngoesophageal transition, which will not only start to have a digestive function, but also be stimulated to take on the production of voice and speech. the pressure observed in the cricopharyngeal segment seems to act as a critical factor for the development of esophageal sound production, and manometry is the procedure capable of quantifying the pressure observed in this region. Objective: the objective of the current study was to assess the upper esophageal sphincter pressure in laryngectomized patients who are either successful or unsuccessful esophageal speakers, both at rest and during esophageal phonation, using manometry. Methods: Twenty laryngectomized persons aged 32 to 83 years (mean, 44. 2 years) were submitted to evaluation by a speech pathologist and divided into two groups, ie, successful esophageal speakers (N = 12) and unsuccessful esophageal speakers (N = 8), according to a scale validated by Wepman et al (1953). the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure was assessed by manometry both at rest and during the following voice emissions in Portuguese: the vowel a, the monosyllable pa, and the sentence papai papou pipoca. the amplitude, the duration of the pressure wave, and the area under the curve were measured. Results: At rest, the mean UES pressure was 11. 83 mm Hg for successful esophageal speakers and 9. 92 mm Hg for unsuccessful esophageal speakers, with no significant difference between groups; the mean for the two groups as a whole was 11. 06 mm Hg. During the voice and speech sequence tests, no significant difference was observed when the emissions in Portuguese of a, pa, and the sentence were analyzed separately. Conclusion: As the pressure observed at rest did not differ between the successful esophageal speakers and the unsuccessful esophageal speakers, and the amplitude, the duration of the pressure wave, and the area under the amplitude x duration curve were also equal for both groups, we conclude that the cricopharyngeal segment pressure is not a preponderant factor for the acquisition of <b>esophageal</b> voice and <b>speech.</b> Univ São Paulo, Sch Med Ribeirao Preto, Dept Ophthalmol Otolaryngol & Head & Neck Surg, BR- 14048900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, BrazilUniv São Paulo, Sch Med Ribeirao Preto, Dept Internal Med, BR- 14048900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, BrazilUniv São Paulo, Sch Med Ribeirao Preto, Dept Social Med, BR- 14048900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Individuals who undergo laryngectomy, {{surgical}} {{removal of}} the larynx, loose their normal voice. The breathing pattern is altered to permanent tracheostomal breathing. A new voice can be established by use of a segment in {{the lower part of}} the pharynx and the most upper part of the esophagus, the pharyngo-esophageal (PE) segment. This is the voice source in tracheoesophageal (TE) <b>speech</b> and <b>esophageal</b> (E) <b>speech).</b> Electrolaryngeal (EL) speech is an alternative speaking technique. The overall aim of this thesis was to describe the function and effects of the PE-segment with the use of endoscopic and radiological methods, to make acoustical and audio-perceptual analyses of laryngectomees voice and speech, and to investigate the laryngectomees self-evaluations of voice function and quality of life. Fifty-four laryngectomees participated in the four studies, all in all 45 TE-speakers, four E-speakers and five EL-speakers. The function of the PE-segment was studied with high-speed imaging recordings and videoradiography. Analyses were made of the vibratory pattern, the shape, the placement and the size of the PE-segment. Recorded speech samples were perceptually and acoustically analysed. Voice problems were evaluated by the use of Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and health-related quality of life was investigated by use of questionnaires from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Volitional control of the musculature in the PE-segment was seen in high-speed imaging recordings (study I). In voiceless consonants the vibrations ceased and an opening gesture in the PE-segment was observed during closure duration. In voiced consonants, the vibrations in the PE-segment continued, although with decreased amplitude compared to the surrounding vowels. These findings should be useful in a therapeutic intervention of the coordination of phonation and articulation. Videoradiographical analyses of changes in shape, size and placement of the PE-segment showed predominant placement of the segment in the pharyngeal posterior wall (study II). The physiological measurements of the PE-segment showed inter-individual variations during both phonation and silence. Both TE- and E-speakers were able to make a good closure between the segment and the anterior wall of the pharynx during phonation. Placement of the segment in relation to the cervical column varied from C 4 to C 7. There were no significant relationships between radiological measurements of the PE-segment, perceptual analyses of voice quality, and acoustical measurements of fundamental frequency and voice intensity. In study IV, mean values of fundamental frequency and voice intensity for TE-speakers were close to normative data, however with wide inter-speaker ranges. Speaking rate for TE-speakers was slow, phrase lengths were short and the number of pauses high, likely due to deviant breath control and manual stoma occlusion. Protocols using visual analogue scales for perceptual ratings of TE-speech and voice proved to be reliable for carefully designed speech-language pathologist ratings. Low pitch, deviant voice quality, low speaking rates and short phrase lengths affected assessments of overall degree of deviation, and these parameters were significantly related to the perceptual assessments. The functional and physical subscales of VHI showed significant relationship with voice intensity, total reading time, phrase length and percent pause time. The emotional subscale of VHI showed no relation with acoustical measurements. Perceptual assessments of TE-speech and voice showed no relationship with the speakers self-reported voice handicap. In study III, self-rated voice handicap (VHI) was moderate for more than 50 percent of the patient group. About one third of the group rated their voice handicap as severe. Scores for the physical and functional subscales were somewhat higher compared to the emotional scale. For TE-speakers, functional and physical voice problems were significantly related to voice intensity, total reading time, phrase length and percent pause time. No other significant relationships were found. Ratings on the functional scales in the EORTC-questionnaire showed mean scores in agreement with normative data. The Global quality of life-scale (Global QOL) showed considerably lower scores as compared to normative data. The EORTC-questionnaire also revealed problems with smell and taste, speech, coughing, and xerostomia. Voice handicap scores showed significant relationship with the participants scoring of Global QOL and the functional scales in the EORTC-questionnaire. VHI-scores were also significantly related to EORTC-scores regarding breathing problems, problems with speech, social contact, pain from the head and neck area, smell and taste, and meal situations. These relationships confirm that the perceived degree of voice handicap affects the individual s participation in social activities. As a conclusion, a combination of the EORTC-questionnaires and the VHI-questionnaire is recommended. Additional questions on tracheostomal breathing, mucus production and coughing is needed for a complete documentation of handicap and health-related quality of life for laryngectomees...|$|R
5000|$|A laryngectomized {{person is}} {{required}} to breathe through a permanent breathing hole in the neck, called a tracheostoma. When a laryngectomized person occludes the tracheostoma, completely blocking exhaled air to leave the body through that pathway, exhaled air is directed through the voice prosthesis. This air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth. During this process, as the air passes through the upper tissues of the esophagus and lower throat, it allows for vibration of the tissues of the pharyngoesophageal segment (also called PE-segment, neoglottis or pseudoglottis). This vibration creates a sound that serves to replace the sound the vocal cords previously produced. Other methods of alaryngeal speech (speech without vocal cords) are <b>esophageal</b> <b>speech,</b> and artificial larynx speech. Studies show that tracheoesophageal speech {{is found to be}} closer to normal speech than <b>esophageal</b> <b>speech</b> and is often reported to be better, both in terms of naturalness as well as how well it is understood, when compared to <b>esophageal</b> <b>speech</b> [...] and electrolarynx speech.The first report on a tracheoesophageal puncture dates back to 1932 when a laryngectomized patient was said to use a hot ice pick to create a tracheoesophageal puncture in himself. This enabled him to speak by forcing air through the puncture when closing off the tracheostoma with a finger.|$|E
50|$|Normal human {{speech is}} pulmonic, {{produced}} with {{pressure from the}} lungs, which creates phonation in the glottis in the larynx, which is then modified by the vocal tract and mouth into different vowels and consonants. However humans can pronounce words {{without the use of}} the lungs and glottis in alaryngeal speech, of which there are three types: <b>esophageal</b> <b>speech,</b> pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as Donald Duck talk).|$|E
50|$|Another {{option for}} {{restoring}} speech after a laryngectomy is the tracheoesophageal puncture or TEP. In this simple surgical procedure, a small puncture is {{made between the}} trachea and the esophagus, and a one-way air valve is inserted.

50|$|<b>Esophageal</b> <b>speech</b> is a {{skill that}} can help {{patients}} to communicate after a laryngectomy, the most common surgery used {{for the treatment of}} laryngeal cancer. In the operation, the larynx and the vocal cords are removed completely. After this, the end of the trachea is sewn onto the edge of an opening cut out at {{the lower part of the}} neck, creating an opening (stoma) the patient will breathe from and cough out mucus from. This hole is called a tracheostoma; the patient uses it to breathe through and cough through after the operation.|$|E
5000|$|The air {{moves from}} outside the body through the tracheostoma {{directly}} to the lungs, without passing through the upper respiratory organs of the nose, mouth, and throat. Because it bypasses the vocal folds, speech can be severely impaired, {{and the development of}} an esophageal voice becomes necessary. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>speech</b> is produced without an artificial larynx, and is achieved by pumping air from the mouth into the upper esophagus. The esophagus is slightly expanded. The air is then released in a regulated manner through the mouth, with simultaneous articulation of words. Vibration of the pharyngoesophageal sphincter replaces vibration of the glottis to produce the esophageal voice.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosthesis}} {{is placed}} approximately 10 - 14 days post operation by a certified speech language pathologist (SLP) {{who specializes in}} ENT work. During the placement of a prosthesis, the SLP measures {{the depth of the}} puncture, chooses the correct prosthesis, and inserts it with a loading device (the entire process can occur in 30-45 minutes pending complications). Patients return for the puncture to be resized every few months after surgery. When the puncture site stops changing sizes, then a more permanent prosthesis can be placed that will last approximately 6-12 months (indwelling prosthesis). Patients may choose this route, in which case they will return to the SLP for placement every 6-12 months, or may choose a low pressure, or duckbill prosthesis that they can change independently at home every few months. This option has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years, as in many cases intelligible voicing may be achieved within minutes of placement of the prosthesis.Some of the advantages to tracheoesophageal puncture are a higher success rate at about 95% of vocal rehabilitation and a much faster time frame compared to <b>esophageal</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E
