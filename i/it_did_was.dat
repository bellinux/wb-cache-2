25|$|David Wheeler, {{who earned}} the world's first Computer Science PhD {{working on the}} project, is {{credited}} with inventing {{the concept of a}} subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping {{to the start of the}} subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{haphazard}} {{nature of}} evacuation, many labourers did not arrive with their factory, {{and had to}} find labour on their own, though jobs were hard to come by. Additionally, cities like Tashkent became overwhelmed at {{the sheer volume of}} people arriving at its gates and had great difficulty supplying the food and shelter necessary for evacuees. Upon arrival, many evacuees died of illness or starvation in extreme poverty in Central Asia. Uzbek officials set up aid stations at Tashkent, which were mirrored at other railway stations to help combat the poverty, but they could only do so much as little could be spared economically for the war effort. Despite these troubles, the ability of Central Asia to absorb Soviet industry and population {{to the extent that it}} did and in the harried manner that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> impressive. The Germans certainly didn't foresee the preparedness of Soviet Central Asia, and in the end they paid dearly for it.|$|E

[...] He estimated that it had taken 1,000 sales for the EP to top the alternative music chart. Fanning said he hoped that the EP’s chart success would open doors for Powderfinger to play at renowned concerts such as the Big Day Out..|$|E

500|$|At 18:00, {{the four}} fighter planes left Ekron to bomb and strafe the Egyptian lines {{concentrated}} near the bridge. Each plane had two [...] bombs, two 13mm {{machine guns and}} two 20mm cannons. The pilots were Lou Lenart, Mordechai Alon (Kalibansky), Ezer Weizmann and Eddie Cohen, in that order. The attack was disorganized, and the damage <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> minimal. Lenart came {{from the north and}} dropped his bombs in the middle of Isdud. He them circled and strafed the Egyptians from the southeast and then the north again, before his cockpit was hit and he decided to return to Ekron. According to him, the cannons ceased to fire after the first ten rounds, and he began to smell cordite. Alon also made three runs, on a large concentration of vehicles south of Isdud. He returned to Ekron through the sea. Weizmann circled and attacked the Egyptians from the south, then the west, and then the south again. His cannons stopped firing after one round.|$|E
500|$|On December 10, the Americans set {{up their}} largest battery of {{artillery}} [...] from the walls. [...] The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks. [...] This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> of little consequence. [...] Montgomery realized {{he was in a}} very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses. [...] The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either have to act or withdraw. [...] Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected.|$|E

He said, [...] "What <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters.

Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis.

60|$|The city--which was the {{original}} London--is the most ancient. It was founded long before {{the days of the}} Romans; so long, in fact, that its origin is wholly unknown.

This church passed through a great variety of mutations during the lapse of successive centuries, having grown old, and been rebuilt, and enlarged, and pulled down, and rebuilt again, and altered, times and ways without number.
