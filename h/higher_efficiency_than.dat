25|$|Not all {{gamma rays}} emitted by the source that {{pass through the}} {{detector}} will produce a count in the system. The probability that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the detector and produce a count is {{the efficiency of the}} detector. High-efficiency detectors produce spectra in less time than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the detector material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed. WR-1, located at the AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Manitoba, used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the primary coolant. The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor. WR-1's outlet temperature was about 490C compared to the CANDU 6's nominal 310C, which means less cooling fluid is needed to remove {{the same amount of}} heat, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> water-cooled versions.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, N. Rouland {{constructed}} a silk-belted machine that rubbed two grounded tubes covered with hare fur. Edward Nairne developed an electrostatic generator for medical purposes in 1787 {{that had the}} ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad. The Winter machine possessed <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> earlier friction machines. In the 1830s, Georg Ohm possessed a machine similar to the Van Marum machine for his research (which is now at the Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany). In 1840, the Woodward machine was developed by improving the Ramsden machine, placing the prime conductor above the disk(s). Also in 1840, the Armstrong hydroelectric machine was developed, using steam as a charge carrier.|$|E

2500|$|The flow battery, an {{experimental}} type, offers {{the option of}} vastly larger energy capacity because its reactants can be replenished from external reservoirs.

2500|$|Central station {{electricity}} {{can often}} be generated with <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly {{the same in the}} nominal regime, diesel motors decrease in efficiency in non-nominal regimes at low power [...] while if an electric power plant needs to generate less power it will shut down its least efficient generators, thereby increasing efficiency. The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by regenerative braking and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that the}} exergy efficiency compares a given cycle to a Carnot heat engine. This is incorrect because a Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine possible, but not the most efficient device for creating work.

5000|$|A PFR {{typically}} has a <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> a CSTR of {{the same}} volume.

This is not always true for reversible reactions.|$|E
30|$|PNAE has a <b>higher</b> {{computational}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> NDNE and SDRCLCE because PNAE uses {{a simpler}} intensity mapping function and a simpler normalization method.|$|R

50|$|The {{conversion}} efficiency of PV devices describes the energy-ratio of the outgoing electrical power {{compared to the}} incoming radiated light.

50|$|More complex {{shapes of}} {{revolution}} are frequently used, such as Bell nozzles or parabolic shapes.

They are widely used on launch vehicles and other rockets where weight is at a premium. They are, of course, harder to fabricate, so are typically more costly.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{centrifugal}} superchargers utilize {{centrifugal forces}} to compress the air, they offer <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> positive displacement designs, {{both in terms}} of power consumption and heat production. “Perhaps the simplest of all superchargers, the centrifugal can also be the most thermally efficient”.

50|$|The {{systems are}} said to have {{advantages}} over photovoltaics on land. The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve <b>higher</b> <b>efficiencies</b> <b>than</b> PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.|$|R
40|$|A scaled {{direct energy}} {{conversion}} device {{was built to}} convert kinetic energy of singly ionized helium ions into an electric potential {{by the process of}} direct conversion. The experiments in this paper aimed to achieve higher potentials and <b>higher</b> <b>efficiencies</b> <b>than</b> ever before. The predicted maximum potential that could be produced by the 150 kV accelerator at the Texas A&M Ion Beam Lab was 150 kV, which was achieved with 92 % collection efficiency. Also, an investigation into factors affecting collection efficiency was made. It was concluded that charge was being lost due to charge exchange occurring near the surface of the target which caused positive target atoms to be ejected from the face and accelerated away. Introducing a wire mesh near the face of the target with an electric potential, positive or negative, which aimed to control secondary ion emissions, did not {{have an effect on the}} collection efficiency of the system. Also, it was found that the gas pressure inside the chamber did not have an effect on the collection efficiency. The goal of achieving higher electric potentials and <b>higher</b> <b>efficiencies</b> <b>than</b> previous direct conversion work was met...|$|R
50|$|Although GEEN has <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> {{many other}} methods in reverse genetics, {{it is still}} not highly efficient; in many cases {{less than half of the}} treated populations obtain the desired changes.

50|$|However, {{the load}} may operate less {{efficiently}} {{owing to the}} harmonics associated with a modified sine wave and produce a humming noise during operation. This also affects {{the efficiency of the}} system as a whole, since the manufacturer's nominal conversion efficiency does not account for harmonics. Therefore, pure sine wave inverters may provide significantly <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> modified sine wave inverters.|$|E
50|$|Energy saving is {{possible}} with older lighting, {{at the expense}} of lower light output, (e.g. incandescent or fluorescent and discharge lighting with inefficient ballast or control gear). Therefore, older commercial and office premises may save more than modern buildings or industrial sites. However modern lighting systems (typically LED) will save significantly more energy due to <b>higher</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>than</b> energy saved on older lighting systems following installation of a voltage optimiser.|$|E
30|$|P 5 ßR enzymes {{are also}} {{promising}} tools {{for carrying out}} biotransformation (a current approach {{has been described by}} Durchschein et al. 2012) because they reduce in vitro a broad variety of molecules bearing an activated C=C double bond, such as monocyclic enones (e.g. 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one, as shown in Fig.  1) or acyclic enoate esters (e.g. ethyl acrylate).

50|$|Chilled {{water is}} used to cool and {{dehumidify}} air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) facilities. Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled chillers incorporate the use of cooling towers which improve the chillers' thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection {{at or near the}} air's wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature. Evaporatively cooled chillers offer <b>higher</b> <b>efficiencies</b> <b>than</b> air-cooled chillers but lower than water-cooled chillers.|$|R
