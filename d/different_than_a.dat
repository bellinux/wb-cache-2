500|$|Some {{conservative}} Christian {{groups have}} targeted Kadabra as representing anti-Christian {{aspects of the}} franchise. In Palm Beach, Florida, Pastor Eugene Walton distributed pamphlets that described the symbol on its head as [...] "a pentagram" [...] (even though Kadabra simply has a red five-pointed star on its head, <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pentagram) and claimed the symbol on its chest was representative of Nazi Germany's Waffen-SS. In the book It's a Dark World, Roger Boehm argued that due to its psychic-status and the symbols on its body of the latter, Kadabra represented the occult, further arguing that the etymology of its name tied directly to them.|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice John Roberts, {{joined by}} Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented and harshly criticized the majority's holding. After {{providing}} historical {{context for the}} separation of powers between the legislature and judiciary found in Article III of the United States Constitution, the Chief Justice explained that §8772 is a type of unconstitutional breach of {{the separation of powers}} between Congress and the judiciary [...] "whereby Congress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular case in the first instance." [...] In his view, §8772 is no <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hypothetical law applying to a case Smith v. Jones in which the legislature says simply [...] "Smith wins". In the Chief Justice's view, §8772 was not a valid exercise of Congress' foreign affairs authority; he contended that Congress and the Executive branch have sufficient authority that they do not need to [...] "seize" [...] the judiciary's power to [...] "make a political decision look like a judicial one." [...] Quoting James Madison in Federalist No. 48, the Chief Justice lamented that this case [...] "will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the judiciary's expense, feeding Congress's tendency to 'extend the sphere of its activity and draw all power into its impetuous vortex.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 October in a speach {{in front}} of the Catalan {{parliament}} Puigdemont stated that he considered the referendum results to be valid and in consequence used the following wording: “I assume the mandate of the people for Catalonia to become an independent state {{in the shape of a}} republic”, before adding that he would “ask Parliament to suspend the effects of the declaration of independence. In response the Central government made a formal request for him to answer before the Monday 16 October 2017 if he declared independence asking specifically for yes or no answer clarifying that any answer <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> [...] "no" [...] would be interpreted as a [...] "yes". Along with the formal request there was also an offer from the central government negotiated with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to evaluate the situation of Catalonia within Spain and to study possible reforms, if needed, to the Spanish Constitution. On 16 October 2017 Puigdemont gave a response that did not address the issue of whether or not there had been a declaration of independence. this triggered a second deadline of 10 am on Thursday 19 October for them to backtrack before direct rule was imposed. The Spanish government subsequently offered to abort the suspension of self-rule if the Catalan government called for regional elections. The response from Puigdemont to the second deadline was again not clear. Since he refused to abandon his independence push, on 21 October the Spanish government initiated the implementation of article 155 of the Spanish constitution.|$|E
