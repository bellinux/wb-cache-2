Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a regression equation to estimate weight of black male paraplegic South African subjects. Very few institutions in South Africa have <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> <b>scales</b> and very few paraplegic persons know what their weight is. People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are reported to have an increased risk to develop obesity and diseases of lifestyle. It is therefore important to monitor the nutritional status of these patients to prevent and treat the above diseases effectively. The aim was to develop an equation that incorporates variables or measurements that do not require a high level of skill and experience to be determined. The equipment needed for the determination of the measurements should also be easily accessible, for example a tape measure rather than a skin-fold caliper...|$|R

40|$|Summary A Lego© robot {{is being}} tested as a {{constant}} speed device to enable more sensitive data collection on the energy cost of pushing two different wheelchairs designed for low income countries. Introduction For many years, treadmills of all kinds <b>including</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> treadmills have been utilized to enable energy cost studies {{to be done at}} a constant speed because there is a non-linear relationship between the speed of travel and the energy cost of moving. However, these treadmills are expensive, bulky, and simply not available in low-income countries where we have been collecting data on the function of pediatric wheelchairs. In a parallel study done in the USA with volunteers pushing wheelchairs, we are testing a Lego© NXT robotic vehicle built and programed to perform as a constant speed device. The robot is much more reasonably priced and is easily transported from one location to the next. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if the vehicle is an adequate replacement for a wheelchair treadmill. Materials and Methods Using a Lego© NXT Education set, engineers at LeTourneau University have designed and built a small robotic vehicle. This robot’s purpose is to travel in front of a wheelchair, and give the user a reference speed while testing. The kit used to build this robot costs less than $ 300. Subjects walked 1 - 2 meters behind the robot at a constant speed of 2. 8 mph for 10 minutes while wearing a heart rate monitor in order to obtain an accurate Physiological Cost Index for pushing the wheelchair. University students pushed two types of wheelchairs, one after the other, on a smooth surface twice, once following the constant speed robot and once selecting their own speed. Preliminary Results T-tests comparing data from the two wheelchairs taken at a self-selected speed were far from significant, while t-tests from data taken while following the robot were much closer to being able to distinguish between the two wheelchairs though they were not quite significant (slightly higher than 0. 05). Conclusion The preliminary data shows promise in confirming that this robot will play the role of a treadmill in enabling more sensitive data on energy cost. Additional data is being collected to see if stronger statistical power enables significant results. It seems likely that this robot may provide an adequate substitute for a treadmill...|$|R
50|$|Cayman Airways largely serves major {{destinations}} in the United States, Jamaica and Cuba {{as well as}} destinations in Honduras. All outbound jet flights originate at Owen Roberts International Airport on Grand Cayman Island {{and often}} remain {{on the ground at}} the destination city for a short time prior to returning inbound to Grand Cayman. Because Owen Roberts International Airport does not have jet bridges, all passengers are routed to and from the terminal building onto the ramp for access to the aircraft using new state of the art boarding ramps, which allow passengers to walk on and off the aircraft without stairs. These ramps also allow passengers with limited mobility, <b>including</b> those in <b>wheel</b> <b>chairs</b> to have much easier access to the aircraft. Upon arrival to most of the international destinations, the aircraft is able to utilize a jet bridge service for deplaning and boarding. All Cayman Airways jet flights permit economy class passengers to check up to two pieces of baggage (up to 55 pounds) without charge, and all flights feature complimentary Tortuga rum punch—a signature cocktail of the Cayman Islands.|$|R

40|$|The commercially {{available}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chairs</b> for amputees donot have the functionality for climbing staircases. In our project, we have designed a manually operated wheelchair that can travel on both plane terrains {{and also in}} the staircases. In our project, instead of using normal wheels we have used penta wheel. The steel rod is penta shaped and each rod is equally inclined of 72 ° from each other. At the time of climbing, one wheel that is the idle wheel will be in contact with the ground and the another wheel will be in contact with the stair. The motion takes place only when we pull the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> backwards towards the staircase. The main aim of our project is to provide stability to the person who travels in the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> (i. e., a large support base and maintain the overall centre of gravity as low as possible).

People with {{disability}} {{have to face}} a lot {{of problems}} in their day-to-day life due to the flexibility issues. One such issue is using the shopping cart in the grocery stores. Using shopping cart becomes very difficult, as they have to control the movement of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> and shopping chair at the same time while placing the grocery in the shopping cart, which is an extra burden on the user. They would have to constantly control the movement of the cart, as there would be lot of obstacles in the store which becomes a very big problem for the user. The aim of my project is to design a device to connect a <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> with a shopping cart. The device would be designed {{in such a way that}} the user would be able to connect the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> with the shopping cart sitting in the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> without anyone???s help.

40|$|Abstract: The {{challenging}} problem {{faced by}} the paralyzed people is their independent mobility. They need an external help to perform their daily activities. The main objective of this project is to rehabilitate the disabled people who cannot perform their voluntary movement. The hardware implementation of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> will be a mobility aid for the patients who are extremely suffering from the quadriplegia. The <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> will work based on the head movement of the user. The recognized gestures are used to generate motion control commands to the controller {{so that it can}} control the motion of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> according to the users intention. Head movement is one of the natural gestures which can be easily tracked. The head movement is the gesture which can be performed by the quadriplegic patients whose body parts below the neck is paralysed. So the head movement is possible for the patients. The wheelchair includes the accelerometer sensor which detects the movement of head and the controller will process the signal and will transmit to the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> for its navigation. This is will offer a small relief to the patients who are tolerating from this condition. The <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is implemented in a cost effective way which reduces the complexity in the design. It is intended {{to be used as a}} human-friendly interface for elderly and disabled people to operate wheelchair using their head gestures rather than their hands. This autonomous navigation ensures safety, flexibility, mobility, obstacle avoidance and an intelligent interface for the users...|$|R
