The state-of-the-art multiscale formulation for fractured media (F-AMS; Tene et al., JCP, 2016) develops an efficient approach for flow equation only. Here, for the first time, the F-AMS formulation is extended to coupled flow-heat equations arising from single-phase flow in fractured geothermal reservoirs. To this end, the multiscale operator is obtained based on elliptic basis functions for both pressure and temperature, to preserve the simplicity and efficiency of the method.

5000|$|Serious decline {{began in}} the 1970s. More wealthy {{families}} moved out as more office buildings were constructed, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez’s [...] "eje" [...] road system, made the colonia less isolated {{from the rest of}} the city and less exclusive. Men’s clubs and prostitution began to appear. The commercial development either destroyed or radically modified the mansions of the early 20th century. One reason for this was that there was little in the way of urban planning or zoning regulations either in this colonia or neighboring ones, so many older homes were either converted into offices and businesses or razed completely to make way for office and apartment buildings.The deterioration culminated with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. A <b>geological</b> <b>fracture</b> erupted southwest to northeast thorough the colonias of Colonia Condesa, Colonia Cuauhtémoc, Colonia Guerrero, Colonia Hipódromo Condesa, Colonia Juarez, Colonia Maza, Colonia Morelos, Colonia Peralvillo, the northern part of Colonia Roma and Colonia Tabacalera. In Roma alone, 472 buildings partially or completely collapsed mostly in the northern part of the colonia around Morelia, Mérida, Cordoba, Puebla, Cuauhtemoc, Insurgentes, San Luis Potosí and Chiapas streets. Most of these buildings were newer, built since the 1950s and many were used for lower class housing, leaving 15,000 homeless. The Conjunto Urbano Benito Juárez, located in the southeast corner of the colonia, was mostly destroyed. The main reasons for the widespread destruction in Roma was that much of it was built on soft former lakebed and much of the newer construction was taller and not as solidly constructed as the older mansions. The widespread destruction and homeless, not only in Roma but in the rest of the city center, created an urgent need for new housing. Destroyed properties were expropriated, and lower class housing was hastily constructed. The cause most of the rest of the older and wealthier residents to leave, and lowered property values greatly. This damage and reconstruction not only cause the flight of the wealthy from Roma, but from neighborhing Colonia Condesa as well, even though it did not suffer significant damage. The effects of this earthquake remain in Roma. As of 2005, there were still fifteen inhabited buildings with serious structural faults at risk of collapse and another 700 considered to be significantly compromised.|$|E

Modern simulators allow phenomena such as thermal effects, mechanics and fluid flow to be treated contributing to reduce exploitation risks. The improvement of computational resources as hardware and software has been responsible for complex and large scale simulations of three-dimensional sedimentary basin models in regional scale, allowing the analysis over the history of a sedimentary basin formation, from its sediments deposition up to generation, expulsion, migration, trapping and conservation of hydrocarbons. Geological faults can {{play an important role in}} producing migration paths and can be simulated by interface finite elements.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model of fault {{nucleation}} and growth based on the Weibull theory, already widely used in fracture research engineering. We propose that, according to a birth-and-growth process, germs (nuclei) are born at random instants at random spatial locations and then grow with time. This leads to a satisfactory formulation of fault length distribution, different from classical statistical laws. Especially, this formulation reconciles previous analyses of fault datasets displaying power-law and/or exponential behaviors. The Weibull parameters can be statistically estimated in a simple way. We show that the model can be successfully fitted to natural data in Kenya and Ethiopia. In contrast to existing descriptive models developed for geological fault systems, such as fractal approaches, the Weibull theory allows to characterize the strength of the material, i. e. its resistance to deformation. Since this model is very general, we expect that it can be applied in many situations, and for simulations of <b>geological</b> <b>fracture</b> processes. The model is independent of deformation intensity and type and therefore allows a better constraint of the seismic risk in threatened regions...|$|E

We tried to determine the age of fracturing by applying the Rb–Sr mineral isochron method to the fracture-filling paragenetic calcite and zeolite samples from fractures in the Kurihashi granodiorite and a skarn in the Kamaishi mine in northeastern Japan. The age of crystallization of fracture-filling minerals was estimated to be in the range 74 to 58 Ma in the Kurihashi granodiorite. The main causes of fracturing were considered to be igneous activities and the cooling of magma. We could not determine ages for some of the fractures we investigated, probably because of the subsequent low-temperature altera-tion after fracturing, or because of host wall rock contamination of the fracture-filling mineral samples. The ages determined for fractures in the skarn pre-dated the skarnization process. It is possible that these fractures formed before the skarnization. However, selective leaching of rubidium during skarnization reduces the Rb/Sr ratio. Therefore, skarnization can have the effect of producing erroneously old Rb–Sr ages. From the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, we determined changes in the strontium isotopic ratio in the local groundwater from the Late Cretaceous through the Paleocene, noting a significant increase at 62 Ma...|$|R

Parallel computing allows us to solve very large linear systems improving the realism of simulations. Several algorithms to simulating fluid flow are proposed for the cases of signiccant matrix permeability. In the case of a weak permeability matrix, the flow is focused in the fractures having a strong permeability and fluids percolate through networks of interconnected fractures. In this paper, we present a complete parallel algorithm for solving flow equations in fracture networks. We consider an imprevious matrix. The different parts of the algorithm are detailed. Numerical examples using the mixed finite element (MFE) method for various fracture networks illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

A major conductive feature in the crust, first noted by White & Milligan (1984) as the Eyre Peninsula Anomaly (EPA), is re-examined to assess its continuity {{to the north of the}} original arrays and to investigate its relationship with major tectonic features. Magnetic-field time-series were converted to induction arrows in the frequency domain. These induction arrows were initially inverted using the minimum-structure 2 -D Occam approach to estimate the electrical conductance of the crust. Following this, thin-sheet forward modelling was used to examine the relationship between the conductance and the dominant tectonic features. The principal results of the modelling are that a narrow conductive feature extends inland from the coast about 160 km before terminating, and the conductance is in the range 3000 to 10 000 S, which decreases inland. A strong correlation exists between the electrical conductance of the Eyre Peninsula and Bouguer gravity anomalies, and in particular the EPA is coincident with a significant Bouguer gravity gradient. There is also good agreement between the locations of the foci of earthquakes of magnitude greater than 4. 0 and the EPA.

Because of sustained economic growth, urbanization and land development, the land cover in Taiwan has undergone frequent use changes. Among the various technologies for monitoring changes in land cover, remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR, are efficient tools for collecting {{a broad range of}} spectral and spatial data. Two types of airborne LiDAR systems exist; full-waveform (FW) LiDAR and traditional discrete-echo LiDAR. Because reflected waveforms are affected by the land object material type and properties, the waveform features can be applied to analyze the characteristics specifically associated with land-cover classification (LCC). Five types of land cover that characterize the volcanic Guishan Island were investigated. The automatic LCC method was used to elucidate the spectral, geomorphometric and textural characteristics. Interpretation keys accompanied by additional information were extracted from the FW LiDAR data for subsequent statistical and separation analyses. The results show that the Gabor texture and geomorphometric features, such as the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) and slopes can enhance the overall LCC accuracy to higher than 90 %. Moreover, both the producer and user accuracy can be higher than 92 % for forest and built-up types using amplitude and pulse width.

40|$|Systems of faults {{and joints}} are {{observed}} to span many scales of length and displacement. Spacing and orientation are rarely constant within any {{area of interest}} to groundwater engineers. It is suggested that the methods used by engineering surface topographists should be applicable to <b>geological</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces. Each fissure is regarded as resulting from the displacement of two, initially matched, rough surfaces. It is argued that a fractured aquifer is best modelled as a pipe network. This would be a similar system to the pore network in a small unfractured subvolume of that aquifer However, the manipulation of models having {{an infinite number of}} elements and many scales of length is not in an advanced state. Accordingly, the fissure system is treated as a pipe network, and the joint blocks are regarded as being subject to one dimensional diffusion. The concept of Pore Span Distribution can be developed from the extensive literature on petroleum reservoir engineering Experimentally determined values of porosity and permeability should be functions of lithology, and also of specimen size and shape. It is a measurable lithological property which describes the degree of interconnection displayed by a pore network. A falling head gas method is developed and used to determine the low permeabilities found in weathered limestone joint block margins. Unusually high seismic anisotropy is observed in the Corallian Limestone due to layering of weathered and unweathered rock, parallel to a dominant joint set.

Most importantly, these are the relative permeabilities of the fluids as well as the macroscopic irreducible saturations. They also influence parameters for component (solute) transport, as it usually occurs through one of the fluid phase only. Here, we present a numerical investigation on the critical role of aperture variation and spatial correlation on fluid trapping and the morphology of fluid phase distributions in a <b>geological</b> <b>fracture.</b> We consider drainage in the capillary dominated regime. The correlation scale, that is, the scale over which the two facing fracture walls are matched, varies among the investigated geometries between L/ 256 and L (self-affine fields), L being the domain/fracture length. The aperture variability is quantified by the coefficient of variation (δ), ranging among the various geometries from 0. 05 to 0. 25. We use an invasion percolation based model which has been shown to properly reproduce displacement patterns observed in previous experiments. We present a quantitative analysis of the size distribution of trapped fluid clusters. We show that when the in-plane curvature is considered, the amount of trapped fluid mass first increases with increasing correlation scale Lc and then decreases as Lc further increases from some intermediate scale towards the domain length scale L. The in-plane curvature contributes to smoothening the invasion front and to dampening the entrapment of fluid clusters of a certain size range that depends on the combination of random aperture standard deviation and spatial correlation...|$|E

The most important factors are lithology, structure, drainage, slope, land-cover, and geomorphology. In order to make a landslide hazard map, all these factors need to be analysed in order to define the instability in a region. Remotely sensed data provide valuable information for determining the occurrence of landslides, such as recent land-cover and fractured zones. • The method of landslide hazard analysis, which is applied in the Thua-Thien-Hue Province (TTH), is based on the methodology of Chung and Shaw (2000) with the following assumptions: Future landslides will occur under circumstances similar to the ones of past landslides in either the study area or in areas in which experts have obtained their knowledge on the relationships between the causal factors and the occurrences of the landslides. • Spatial GIS data representing the causal factors can be used to formulate the future landslide hazard. Data integration was carried out using the ordinal scale (qualitative) relative weighting rating technique to give a Landslide Hazard Index (LHI) value. The breaks in the LHI frequency diagram were used to delineate various landslide hazard zones, namely, very low, low, moderate, high and very high.

Similarly, extensions of some fractures, not apparent on existing maps, have been revealed. Synthesis of this information gave a new lithostructural map. Comparing it with previous works showing that the geological contours mapped are the same with those references. However, the Niellé massif and Dioula volcano-sedimentary series could not be differentiated. Similarly, simulated image was ineffective at detailed mapping...|$|R
40|$|Lavadores' beach {{stands on}} the South of the Douro's river mouth about 2 km from Porto. It's the only sector of litoral "high" coast at the South of Douro's. This beach stays {{very close to the}} passage through the {{coastline}} of the Porto-Tomar fault, which corresponds to the contact between the Central-Iberian and Ossa-Morena zones. Posttectonics granite’s are outcropping in this beach. The fracture net seems to control the development of the coastline, imposing a rigid orientation to the cliffs as well on certain rectlineous corridors inside between the granites’ walls, which are usually abrupt. The same fracture net controls the existence of a typical block disjunction and other geomorphologic aspects of detail. We pretend to present geological and geomorphological sketches of the exposed rocks at the Lavadores beach and discuss the relationship between the <b>geological</b> structure (<b>fracture</b> net, neotectonics) and the forms due to the marine erosion...|$|R
