5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E

That being true, a jury might have found <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> accused were embarked upon a single venture, in all parts of which each was a participant, and an abettor in <b>the</b> sense <b>that</b> <b>the</b> success of <b>that</b> part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionaries started {{negotiations}} with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held Sun Yat-sen's power of attorney, to buy a million rifles. However, the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders. From China, Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement. However, he was forced into hiding within 48 hours {{when he came to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese authorities planned to hand him over to the British. Later reports indicated he was protected at this time by Toyama Mitsuru right-wing political leader and founder of the Genyosha nationalist secret society.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stone mask and its powers {{would be what}} would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; {{he came up with}} the idea of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

5|$|German forces {{began to}} probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences {{throughout}} the morning. Units of Kampfgruppe Von Tettau attacked the Border's positions; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and Kriegsmarine troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew. Small amounts of fighting broke out around LZ 'X' {{but not enough to}} seriously hamper the glider landing there. At DZ 'Y', the Dutch SS Wach Battalion became heavily engaged with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, threatening to hamper the arrival of the second lift. The communications breakdown meant {{that it was impossible to}} warn the aircraft. Equally, there was no way for the division to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2nd lift had been delayed by ground fog in England. Thus, the arrival of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue. When the parachutists did arrive after 15:00, they dropped under fire. Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath-land they were landing on caught fire. Nevertheless, the arrival of a full brigade overwhelmed the Dutch who were routed and surrendered in droves.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. The Germans did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including Lion, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.|$|E
