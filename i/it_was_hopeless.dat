500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the circle of}} friends with whom Presley {{constantly}} surrounded himself until his death {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Memphis Mafia". [...] "Surrounded by the parasitic presence", as journalist John Harris puts it, [...] "it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open." [...] Tony Brown, who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: [...] "But we all knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hopeless</b> because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends". In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, [...] " [...] was his own man.... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier." ...|$|E
2500|$|The planned {{attack on}} Fort Fisher {{required}} {{the cooperation of}} the army, and the troops were taken from the Army of the James. It was expected that Brigadier General Godfrey Weitzel would command, but Major General Benjamin F. Butler, the commander of the Army of the James, exercised one of the prerogatives of his position to install himself as leader of the expedition. Butler proposed that the fort could be flattened by exploding a ship filled with gunpowder near it, and Porter accepted the idea; if successful, the scheme would avoid a protracted siege or its alternative, a frontal assault. Accordingly, the old steamer [...] was packed with powder and blown up in the early morning of December 24, 1864. It had, however, no discernible effect on the fort. Butler brought part of his troops ashore, but he was already convinced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hopeless,</b> so he removed his force before making an all-out assault.|$|E
2500|$|From the mid 1960s {{until the}} summer of 1971, the theatre was owned by a Salford businessman, Councillor Sam Goldberg. Goldberg allowed {{repertory}} groups such as Venture Productions to put on productions rent free. He also used the theatre as winter headquarters for his own Southport Repertory Company. Goldberg tried unsuccessfully to sell the freehold to Salford City Council, {{in the hope that}} they might operate the building as a civic theatre and arts centre. Talks stalled after it was estimated that the cost of modernising the building could be about £80,000, the theatre was running at a loss at the time of Goldberg's death. Councillor Cecil Franks, the chairman, said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hopeless</b> to try to maintain a [...] "Victorian relic" [...] of this size in its present form. Goldberg died prior to the North Manchester Amateur Operatic Society's production of [...] "The Quaker Girl", May–June 1971, (music by Lionel Monckton, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank), the theatre then lay dark.|$|E

60|$|At last, {{somehow or}} other, {{it does get}} up, and you land the things. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hopeless</b> {{attempting}} to make a wood fire, so you light the methylated spirit stove, and crowd round that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean {{chances to}} marry," [...] said Isabel, her colour quickly {{coming back to}} her. And then she stopped, looking down with a deep frown, as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>hopeless</b> to attempt to make her meaning clear.|$|R
6000|$|Before he {{left that}} evening Spode made an {{alarming}} discovery. Mr. Tillotson did not possess a dress-suit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hopeless</b> {{to think of}} getting one made at this short notice, and, besides, what an unnecessary expense! ...|$|E

6000|$|The men-at-arms {{looked at}} each other, and guarded the door more closely. Osmond saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hopeless,</b> and only wanted to draw his young charge back without being recognised, but Richard exclaimed loudly, [...] "What means this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He cries you down,' {{repeated}} Gudrun. 'And by mere {{force of}} violence. And of course <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hopeless.</b> Nobody <b>is</b> convinced by violence. It makes {{talking to him}} impossible--and living with him I should think {{would be more than}} impossible.' ...|$|R
