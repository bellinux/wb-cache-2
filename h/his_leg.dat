5|$|Although he was {{eligible}} to declare for the CFL Draft, Aidoo chose {{to remain with}} the Marauders for the 2002 season, citing a desire to further recover from <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> injury. His season was again plagued by injury. Aidoo struggled in the season opener, rushing six times for 16 yards. Due to his recurring leg injury and a new back injury, he sat out the next five games. Aidoo returned in mid-October and played in a 72–0 blowout against the Toronto Varsity Blues, but he received only three carries. He also played on special teams. He did not appear in another game for the Marauders that season due to <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] responded {{his mother}} thoughtfully, [...] "you're right there. <b>His</b> <b>legs</b> are <b>his</b> weak point. I can't say I {{think much of}} <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> myself." ...|$|R
500|$|The CGI {{removal of}} actor Gary Sinise's <b>legs,</b> after <b>his</b> {{character}} had them amputated, {{was achieved by}} wrapping <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> with a blue fabric, which later facilitated {{the work of the}} [...] "roto-paint" [...] team to paint out <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> from every single frame.

5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E

5000|$|The {{placement}} of the legs usually falls into two categories. The first is a body lock. The attacker places one of <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> across the stomach or lower chest of the victim. He then places <b>his</b> other <b>leg</b> over <b>his</b> own shin, creating a figure-four with <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> This allows him to limit movement and {{stay close to the}} back of his victim. This technique was used by Anderson Silva against Dan Henderson and by Jim Miller against Melvin Guillard. The other common technique is known as using [...] "hooks". In this version the attacker places <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> inside of the victim's legs. He then moves <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> out, placing <b>his</b> shin behind the victim's knees, essentially using his shins and feet as hooks to control the victim's legs.|$|R
5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride.

On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} the glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E
5|$|After the day's play, former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly {{and former}} {{teammate}} of Bradman, now a journalist, consulted Bedser on {{his use of}} leg theory.

5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of <b>his</b> <b>leg.</b> Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment that}} Cheenbuk felt the noose tighten on <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> {{he knew that}} it was all over with him. To run or fight with <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> tied would be impossible, so, like a true philosopher, he {{submitted}} to the inevitable and gave in. His captors, however, did not deem it wise or safe to relax their hold until they had swathed his body with deerskin thongs; then they removed the belt from <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and assisted him to rise.|$|R
5|$|As in the {{previous}} winter, Simpson went on a skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, breaking his right tibia, and <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> was in a plaster cast {{until the end of}} February.
