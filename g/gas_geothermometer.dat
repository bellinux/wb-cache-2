40|$|Several {{formulas}} {{of surface}} <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometer</b> {{have been developed}} to utilize in geothermal exploration, i. e. by D'Amore and Panichi (1980) and by Darling and Talbot (1992). This paper presents an empirical <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometer</b> formula using multidimensional approach. The formula was derived from 37 selected chemical data of the 5 production wells from the Awibengkok Geothermal Volcanic Field in West Java. Seven components, i. e., gas volume percentage, CO 2, H 2 S, CH 4, H 2, N 2, and NH 3, from these data are utilize to developed three model equations which represent relationship between temperature and gas compositions. These formulas are then tested by several fumarolic chemical data from Sibual-buali Area (North Sumatera) and from Ringgit Area (South Sumatera). Preliminary result indicated that gas volume percentage, H 2 S and CO 2 concentrations have a significant role in term of <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometer.</b> Further verification is currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|Various {{sources for}} {{hydrothermal}} CH 4 {{have been proposed}} over the years. While C isotope studies have narrowed the possibilities, enough higher hydrocarbon gas data now exist both to supplement the isotopic data and to permit additional deductions regarding origins. Comparison of typical C 1 –C 6 data for gases of various origins (from sedimentary and crystalline rocks, and hydrothermal systems) reveals certain characteristics. Apart from isotopic differences, hydrothermal hydrocarbons differ from sedimentary hydrocarbons mainly in possessing tendencies towards a relative excess of CH 4, higher normal/iso ratios for butane and pentane, and relatively high amounts of C 6 gases. Despite these differences, consideration of the evidence indicates that hydrothermal hydrocarbon gases in most cases originate like sedimentary basin gases by thermal degradation of organic matter in the relatively shallow subsurface. The principal characteristic of these hydrothermal gases, “excess” CH 4, {{appears to have a}} geothermometric function. The following empirical relationship has been derived: t°C= 57. 8 log(CH 4 /C 2 H 6) + 96. 8, which fits moderately well a range of geothermal fields worldwide. This <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometer</b> may be particularly applicable during geothermal exploration in areas where there is little direct knowledge of subsurface conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Chemical and isotopic {{data are}} {{presented}} for nonthermal, thermal, and slightly thermal springs and drill holes and fumaroles on Mount Hood, Oregon. Temperatures of nonthermal springs on Mount Hood decrease with elevation and {{are similar to}} air temperatures from nearby weather stations. Dissolved constituents in nonthermal springs generally increase with spring temperatures and reflect weathering of volcanic rock from the action of dissolved carbon dioxide. Isotopic contents of nonthermal springs follow a local meteoric water line and generally become lighter with elevation. Some nonthermal springs at low-elevation have light values of isotopes indicating a high-elevation source for the water. Three hydrothermal systems have been identified on Mount Hood. Swim Warm Springs is interpreted to have a source water that boiled from 187 °C, re-equilibrated at 96 °C, and then mixed with nonthermal water to produce the range of compositions found in various springs. The Meadows Spring is interpreted to have a source water that boiled from 223 °C, re-equilibrated at 94 °C, and then mixed with nonthermal water to produce the range of compositions found in the spring over several years. Both systems contain water that originated as precipitation at higher elevation. The summit fumaroles have <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometer</b> temperatures generally over 300 °C, indicating {{that they are not}} the steam discharge from the Swim and Meadows hydrothermal systems. Representative values of thermal discharge for the three hydrothermal systems are 10 MWt for the fumaroles, 2. 2 MWt for Swim, and 1. 9 MWt for the Meadows and Cascade springs...|$|E
30|$|The {{chemistry}} of discharging stream from the wells indicated that about 98 % {{of the total}} gas content is CO 2, while H 2 S, N 2, Ar, H 2 and CH 4 form the remaining steam components (Kosari 2011). The temperature calculated by <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers,</b> particularly H 2 S geothermometer changes from 269.1 to 277.1  °C (with an average of 274.2  °C), is fairly well correlated with that of Na–K geothermometer (279  °C). However, CO 2 geothermometer estimated temperatures ranging from 287.3 to 308.9  °C (having an average of 301.8  °C) which is higher than those calculated applying all the other gas and solute thermometers (Table  3). The elevated CO 2 concentration in deep liquid {{is the main reason}} for this overestimation (Kosari and Sattari 2015).|$|R
40|$|The low {{enthalpy}} program {{developed in}} the Paris Basin provides the opportunity for studying the gas geochemistry of the calcareous aquifer of the Dogger. Hydrocarbons and CO{sub 2 } are mainly biogenic, He displays high concentrations. He, Ar and N{sub 2 } have multiple origins (radioactive decay, atmospheric migration, biochemical processes). The distribution of the gases in the zones of the basin varies {{in relation to the}} general chemistry, sedimentology and hydrodynamics. The <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> do not apply to this environment but useful estimations of the redox potential of the fluid can be derived from CO{sub 2 }/CH{sub 4 } and N{sub 2 }/NH{sub 4 }{sup +} ratios. H{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S are involved in corrosion processes and scaling in the pipes. 12 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Five new <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> are introduced. They {{are useful}} for {{predicting}} subsurface temperatures in water dominated geothermal systems. The geothermometers use data on CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }S and H{sub 2 } concentrations in fumarole steam as well as CO{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S/H{sub 2 } ratios. It is demonstrated that the gas composition of fumarole steam may be used with or withour drillhole data to evaluate steam condensation in the upflow zones of geothermal systems. Uncertainty exists, however, in distinguishing between the effects of steam condensation and phase separation at elevated pressures. The gas content in steam from discharging wells and the solute content of the water phase {{can be used to}} evaluate which boiling processes lead to "excess steam" in the discharge and at which temperature this "excess steam" is added to the fluid moving through the aquifer and into the well. Examples, using field data, are given to demonstrate all the mentioned applications of geothermal chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> {{exist that}} have {{applications}} in the geothermal industry. Most {{are based on the}} CO 2 -CH 4 -H 2 -H 2 O system but none involve H 2 S, a gas that is always present in geothermal systems. The equilibrium reactions for water-magnetite-pyrite-pyrrhotite-H 2 S-CO 2 -CH 4 were first described by Norman et al. (1998) to explain approaching equilibrium from the hot and cold sides. Equilibrium is based on the reaction: 2 Fe 3 O 4 + 12 H 2 S + CO 2 = 6 FeS 2 + 10 H 2 O + CH 4 Fluid-rock equilibria modeling using PHREEQC v. 2. 10 confirms that the H 2 S content increases approximately five fold for every 50 °C increase in temperature. The H 2 S concentration increases from 0. 0003 mole % at 200 °C to 0. 008 mole % at 300 °C. A formula to calculate temperature based on H 2 S concentration is presented for the 200 - 300 °C range and is valid for non-boiling low-salinity fluids...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon gases are {{ubiquitous}} in the hydrothermal {{systems of the}} East African Rift System (EARS), though often found at very low concentrations in the ‘volcanic’ eastern branch {{as compared to the}} ‘sedimentary’ western branch. Study of the chemical and isotopic compositions of these hydrocarbons from sites in Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Uganda reveals considerable homogeneity over hundreds of km of the various rift units. Consideration of C and He isotopic evidence points to a predominantly crustal thermogenic origin for the hydrocarbons, there being no evidence of mantle inputs in either the MORB or ‘hotspot’ sectors of the EARS. Temperature information from geothermal wells has been utilised to investigate the relationship between reservoir temperatures and ratios of CH 4 to C 2 H 6. The general C 1 /C 2 geothermometric relationship proposed in Part 1 of this study holds reasonably well, and is shown to give results equal to or better than the ‘inorganic’ <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> presently in use, both in the wellfields and undeveloped high-enthalpy geothermal areas. Results from low-enthalpy hot spring systems are less well correlated with apparent deep temperatures, but consistent with data from similar systems elsewhere in the world. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European Hot Dry Rock Energy (HDR) Program, three deep wells (5000 m) have been drilled into a fractured granite basement at Soultz-sous-Forêts, located within the Rhine Graben, in order to develop a deep heat exchanger (GPK- 3 as injector and GPK- 2 /GPK- 4 as producers) and produce electricity after the creation of an EGS reservoir. Despite very few representative analyses of deep geothermal fluids, often contaminated by drilling fluids or injected waters, the geochemical data provide interesting information on the nature, origin, circulation and deep temperature of these fluids (Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). They indicate similar chemical and isotopic compositions (NaCl fluids) and high salinity values (TDS about 100 g/l) which suggest a common sedimentary origin and identical water-rock interaction processes. This sedimentary origin is confirmed by the presence of organic matter in highly fractured and altered granite cores (Ledésert et al., 1996) and of dissolved organic carbon in fluid samples. The chemical and <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> suggest that the native geothermal brine and associated gases are equilibrated with a mineralogical assemblage at temperatures close to 220 - 240 °C (> 200 °C measured a t the bottom-hole; Sanjuan et al., 2006...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of two high-temperature fumaroles, with gas geochemistry compatible with an economic geothermal system, established Apacheta {{as one of}} the most attractive geothermal exploration prospects in northern Chile. These remote fumaroles at 5, 150 m elevation were first sampled in 1999 by ENAP and its partners, following up on the reports of a CODELCO water exploration well that flowed small amounts of dry steam at 4, 540 m elevation in the valley 4. 5 km east of the fumaroles. The prospect is associated with a Plio-Pleistocene volcanic complex located within a NW-trending graben along the axis of the high Andes. The regional water table is ~ 4, 200 masl. There are no hot springs, just the 88 °C steam well and the 109 ° and 118 °C fumaroles with gas compositions that indicate reservoir temperatures of ≥ 250 °C, using a variety of <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers.</b> An MT-TDEM survey was completed in 2001 - 2002 by Geotérmica del Norte (SDN), an ENAP-CODELCO partnership, to explore the Apacheta geothermal concession. The survey results indicated that base of the low resistivity clay cap has a structural apex just west of the fumaroles, a pattern typically associated with shallow permeability within a high temperature geothermal resource. SGN plans to drill at least one exploration well in 2002 - 03 to characterize a possible economic resource at Apacheta...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} gas samples {{collected from}} fumaroles and bubbling pools at Irruputuncu, Putana, Olca and Alitar volcanoes {{located in the}} central Andes volcanic zone (northern Chile). The Irruputuncu and Putana fumarolic discharges showed outlet temperatures ranging from 83 ˚C to 240 ˚C and from 82 ˚C to 88 ˚C, respectively. The chemical and isotopic (3 He/ 4 He, d 13 C-CO 2, d 18 O-H 2 O and dD-H 2 O) compositions of these discharges were similar to medium-to-high temperature volcanic gases from other active volcanoes in this sector of the Andean volcanic chain (e. g. Lascar volcano). Inorganic and organic <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> for the H 2 O-CO 2 -CO-H 2, CO 2 -CH 4 and C 2 -C 3 alkenes-alkanes systems indicated equilibrium temperatures that exceed 500 ˚C at the gas sources. These relatively high temperatures are {{in agreement with the}} presence of relevantly high concentrations of magmatic gas emissions, including SO 2. Olca and Alitar volcano fluid chemistries indicated lower amounts of magmatic-derived gas species, while both the helium and the water isotopic compositions suggested significant fractions of shallow, crustal/meteoric-originated fluids. These indicate contributions from a hydrothermal environment with temperatures &lt; 400 ˚C. The geochemical and isotopic features derived from the present study show that the Irruputuncu, Putana, Olca and Alitar volcanoes should be considered as active and thus warrant periodic geochemical monitoring to determine the evolution of these systems and their potential hazards. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} is {{dedicated}} to Yuri Taran's outstanding contributions to gas geochemistry {{that began in the}} early 1980 s with his work on deuterium and 18 O compositions of geothermal waters in the Mutnovsky (Kamchatka) region and continues to this day with work on the Kamchatka volcanic volatile budget, carbon isotopes of hydrocarbons, and new insights into the geochemistry of El Chichón volcano, Chiapas. Yuri has contributed greatly to the field of volcanic gas geochemistry and was the first to recognize the distinct deuterium and oxygen isotopic composition of fumarole condensates from volcanoes in Kamchatka (Taran et al. 1987 a). The shift in δD and δ 18 O to significantly heavier values compared to local meteoric water led Yuri to introduce the term “andesitic water” (Taran et al. 1989 a, b) which has since been recognized at subduction zone volcanoes globally. This distinct isotopic composition is evidence that volcanoes release water that ultimately originates as subducted seawater and is recycled through the mantle wedge back to the earth's surface. Yuri's early work on the gas emissions from Kamchatka and Kurile Islands volcanoes also included the development and testing of <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> (Taran 1986) and investigating hydrothermal alteration using isotopic data (Taran et al. 1987 b). His curiosity remained focused on the isotope systematics of volcanic gases discharging from Kamchatka and the Kuriles through the late 1980 s and 1990 s with publications on the gas compositions of Klyuchevskoi (Taran et al. 1991), Mutnovsky (Taran et al. 1992), Avachinsky and Koryaksky (Taran et al. 1997). Yuri was involved in the discovery of a pure and unique rhenium mineral on Kudryavy volcano (Korzhinsky et al. 1994) and provided one of the most detailed chemical studies of high temperature (up to 950 °C) fumaroles to date of any volcano (Taran et al. 1995). His 1995 paper on Kudryavy remains highly cited and provides the highest quality volcanic gas data which also include trace elements from a subduction zone. Such data are crucial when we attempt to interpret lower temperature volcanic gas compositions or calculate rare metal fluxes from volcanoes worldwide. His most recent publication on Kamchatka-Kurile volcanic emissions provides a detailed analysis of the total gas flux from these volcanoes (Taran 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{compositions}} {{of steam}} from the vapor-dominated geothermal systems of Larderello, Italy and The Geysers, California {{have been shown}} by previous investigators to vary with position in the field. The most conspicuous chemical patterns observed in the Larderello and The Geysers vapor-dominated geotherrnal are strong increases or decreases from the center {{to the edges of}} constituents carried in the steam. The pattern of these parameters in vapor-dominated systems seem to be controlled mainly by a process of lateral steam movement and condensation. The condensation process, at constant temperature and total pressure increases the partial pressure of CO{sub 2 } {{at the same rate as}} the gas/steam ratio, strongly affecting the composition of the total gas (including steam). The condensation effect should increase contents of CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }S, H{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 } in the residual steam to about the same degree because their solubilities are similar. However, the general trend observed is almost constant ratios of H{sub 2 }S, H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 } to H{sub 2 }O as the CO{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 }O ratio increases in Larderello about 5 - 6 times from the center to the edges at constant temperature. This means that the H{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }/CO{sub 2 }, and H{sub 2 }S/CO{sub 2 } ratios decrease with increasing CO{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 }O ratios. Apparently the only rnechanism that can explain this behavior is reaction of these three gases with other gases and with reservoir minerals so that the partial pressures of these gases are buffered by temperature-dependent reactions with water and rock minerals. A system of appropriate equations involving H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }. CH{sub 4 }, H{sub 2 }S were set up. The geothermometers have been tested on data from the Italian fields of Larderello, Travale, Bagnore, Piancastagnaio and from The Geysers, U. S. A. The <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> have been applied t o steam samples from wells FBN and ALR in order to define changes in both well and reservoir temperatures. The H{sub 2 }S geothermometer appears to give results consistant with liquid-based geothermometers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of the European Hot Dry Rock Energy (HDR) Program, three deep wells (5000 m) have been drilled into a fractured granite basement at Soultz-sous-Forêts, located within the Rhine Graben, in order to develop a deep heat exchanger (GPK- 3 as injector and GPK- 2 /GPK- 4 as producers) and produce electricity after the creation of an EGS reservoir. Despite very few representative analyses of deep geothermal fluids, often contaminated by drilling fluids or injected waters, the geochemical data provide new and interesting information on the nature, origin, circulation and deep temperature of these fluids (Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). They indicate similar chemical and isotopic compositions (NaCl fluids) and high salinity values (TDS about 100 g/l) which suggest a common sedimentary origin and identical water-rock interaction processes. The chemical and <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> suggest that the native geothermal brine and associated gases are equilibrated with a mineralogical assemblage at temperatures close to 220 - 240 °C (> 200 °C measured at the bottom-hole; Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). According to the Na/Li geothermometer and the  7 Li values, these equilibrium reactions would occur in a sedimentary rather than granite reservoir (Fig. 1). Given the location of the Soultz site and these constraints, this reservoir would be situated more eastern, towards the Graben centre where the Triassic sedimentary formations are the deepest and hottest (Fig. 2). From tracer tests carried out after 2000, the natural flux of the native geothermal brine was estimated at 1 - 1. 2 m 3 /h, which is identical to that calculated for the fluid flux parallel to the Graben strike, based on a convection model and numerical 3 D modeling (Bächler, 2003; Sanjuan et al., 2006 b and c). During all the production and circulation tests, the tracer tests and geochemical data showed the omnipresence of the native geothermal brine in the discharged fluids even after injection of large amounts of external water into the wells. The existence of at least three fluid flow pathways between the wells GPK- 2 and GPK- 3 with different effective fluid velocities, which contrasts with a poor hydraulic connection between GPK- 3 and GPK- 4 (Fig. 3), was highlighted during the fluid circulation loop and the associated tracer test using fluorescein, carried out between July and December 2005 (Sanjuan et al., 2006 b and c) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{exploration}} {{phase was}} carried out in the Lamentin plain (Martinique, French West Indies) in 2001. On the three bore-holes drilled by CFG in this area, only the bore-hole located more at north (Californie bore-hole) and near the old LA- 101 borehole, indicated the presence of inflows of hot fluid close to 90 °C starting from 400 m of depth. The main inflow was observed at about this depth. A similar geothermal fluid was also found at a depth of about 400 m in the Carrère bore-hole, situated near thermal springs, but with a lower temperature (50 °C). The geochemical monitoring carried out by BRGM made it possible to find some surface inflows of cold fluid with often a probable marine influence in the three bore-holes and to characterise the chemical and isotopic composition of the low temperature geothermal fluid. According to the geochemical data, this Na-Cl geothermal fluid (TDS ≈ 10 - 11 g/l; pH ≈ 6. 2 - 6. 3) is a mixing of 20 - 25 % sea water and 80 - 75 % fresh water, which could mainly come from the massif of the Pitons du Carbet, following a general structural NW-SE direction. This mixing has reacted with the surrounding volcanic rocks and with magmatic CO 2 emanations (minimum CO 2 partial pressure estimated to 1 bar). Relative to a diluted sea water, it is enriched in dissolved Ca, HCO 3, SiO 2, Sr, Ba, B, As, Fe, Mn, Li, Rb, Cs and Ge and depleted in SO 4 and Mg. Additional chemical and isotopic analyses performed on the fluids of neighbouring thermal springs confirm these results and indicate that the geothermal fluid sampled in the bore-holes has been slightly diluted probably by the drilling fluid. When applied on all these fluids, numerous chemical geothermometers yield concordant values of deep temperature around 90 - 130 °C, which are close to the measured temperatures and to those estimated using the <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers.</b> The relatively high Mg and SO 4 concentrations of these waters and their absence of a 18 O enrichment from the rocks are rather in agreement with the moderate temperature estimated using the geothermometers. All the results suggest that the temperature gradient increases towards the north of the Lamentin plain where the geothermal reservoir would be rather located. According to the geochemical results, the geothermal fluid would derive from a reservoir situated near sea water, somewhere between the Lamentin plain and the Absalon-Didier area. This fluid would flow out laterally from NW to SE at relatively low depths. No major evidence of a high temperature geothermal reservoir was observed in the Lamentin and Absalon-Didier areas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} the first to present the main geochemical {{characteristics}} of the native brines collected from all the geothermal wells penetrating the granite basement underlying the sedimentary cover, in the Upper Rhine Graben. These deep wells (from 2580 to 5000 m) were only drilled in four geothermal sites (Soultz-sous-Forêts and Rittershoffen in France; Landau and Insheim in Germany). The Na-Cl geothermal brine samples collected from the granite returned TDS values ranging from 99 to 107 g/l with pH values close to 5, along with Cl and Br concentrations and delta D, delta 18 O and delta 34 S values that indicate a multiple origin with mixing between primary brine formed by advanced evaporation of seawater (probably until the stage of halite precipitation) and dilute meteoric water, plus contributions from halite dissolution following successive marine transgression-regression cycles from the Triassic to the Oligocene. Chemical, isotopic and <b>gas</b> <b>geothermometers</b> indicate concordant reservoir temperatures close to 225 ± 25 °C for all the fluids, even though the maximum temperature so far measured on site is 200 °C. An exhaustive literature review has indicated that only the geothermal brine from the deep Cronenbourg well (2870 m) ending in the Buntsandstein has similar chemical and isotopic compositions (apart from Br and Ca) to the fluids from the granite, with an identical estimation of reservoir temperature from geothermometry. Geothermal brine from the deep Bruchsal well (2540 m), drilled down to the junction of the Buntsandstein and the Saxo-Thuringian formations, has a higher TDS value (120 - 125 g/l) with its chemical and isotopic compositions giving a lower estimation of reservoir temperature (190 ± 25 °C). By contrast, geothermal brine from the Bühl well (2655 m) ending in the Buntsandstein has an even higher TDS value of about 201 g/l and a lower temperature-at-depth estimation of 110 ± 25 °C, close to the temperature measured on site (115 °C). The above results indicate that the geothermal fluids collected from the granite probably originate from Triassic sedimentary formations located at great depth (≥ 4 km) with temperatures close to 225 ± 25 °C in the centre of the Rhine Graben, but that their different TDS and Cl/Br values reflect the presence of several distinct geothermal reservoirs. Many discrepancies due to high-temperature water-rock interactions are revealed on comparing the chemical and isotopic compositions of the hot brines with those of cooler brines from Bühl and the Landau Eocene-Oligocene oilfield wells, among others. The hottest brines are much enriched in K, Ca, SiO 2, Li, Rb, Cs, As, Sr, Ba, Mn, Nd, U and in metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, Co, Cd, Sb, but are depleted mainly in Mg, SO 4 and B and have much lower isotopic Li and B signatures. The He isotopic signatures of the gases associated with these fluids (R/Ratm. = 0. 128 at Bruchsal and 0. 252 at Insheim) confirm that the thermal anomalies are mainly crustal and not mantle-derived (1. 46 % and 2. 88 % of mantellic He, respectively, for the two sites). Thus it is concluded that the thermal anomalies are associated mainly with the convective circulation of hot fluids along probable NE-SW faults between the graben’s deep sedimentary centre and the fractured granite basement at its edges. Moreover, {{the western part of the}} Upper Rhine Graben (the Landau, Insheim, Soultz, Rittershoffen and Cronenbourg sites) seems to be hotter than the eastern part (Bruchsal and Bühl). According to the U-Th isotope system, the minimum transit time of these deep geothermal brines would be about 1000 years...|$|R
