Until now, the LED process could not make LED from broken substrates during production.

Therefore, if additional mark printed on the blue tape, it will be able to process the following post-process.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} and comprehensive repair techniques is increasing {{throughout the world}} as existing concrete structures continue to age. The bonded concrete overlay method, where a new repair material layer is cast over an existing <b>damaged</b> <b>substrate,</b> is the most commonly utilized method of repair. However, this repair technique is prone to failure due to differential volume changes between the newly cast repair material and the existing substrate. These volume changes {{can be attributed to}} thermal and shrinkage differences, with drying shrinkage being identified as they key source of the volume change. When the resulting induced stress form the differential volume changes exceeds the intrinsic tensile strength of the repair material, cracking failure occurs. This can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the repair and its durability. Overlay crack resistance {{has been found to be}} dependent on specific material properties, namely: tensile strength, elastic modulus and shrinkage. The effect of tensile relaxation on overlay performance is also significant, with the resulting 'stress relief' cause by this relaxation prolonging the time to cracking failure. In this investigation, the influence of the inclusion of coarse aggregate in the repair material is investigated. The study focuses on the specific impact of coarse aggregate volume content and size on the performance of bonded overlay materials, and the material properties that influence this performance. Two laboratory concrete mixes, with a w:c = 0. 45 and 0. 6, and a commercial repair product were tested with varying coarse aggregate volume contents. Further testing was conducted with w:c = 0. 6 laboratory mixes with different nominal sized coarse aggregates. The impact of coarse aggregate volume and size on individual material properties, which included tensile strength, tensile relaxation, free drying shrinkage and elastic modulus, were tested separately for the various mixes. In conjunction with this, direct restrained shrinkage tests were conducted using ring tests to measure the influence of coarse aggregate volume and size on the time to cracking failure and crack intensity of the repair materials...|$|E

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a progressive}} degenerative disease of motor neurons. The inherited {{form of the}} disease, familial ALS, represents 5 – 10 % of the total cases, and the best documented of these are due to lesions in SOD 1, the gene encoding copper–zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The mechanism by which mutations in SOD 1 cause familial ALS is currently unknown. Two hypotheses have dominated recent discussion of the toxicity of ALS mutant CuZnSOD proteins: the oligomerization hypothesis and the oxidative damage hypothesis. The oligomerization hypothesis maintains that mutant CuZnSOD proteins are, or become, misfolded and consequently oligomerize into increasingly high-molecular-weight species that ultimately lead {{to the death of}} motor neurons. The oxidative damage hypothesis maintains that ALS mutant CuZnSOD proteins catalyze oxidative reactions that <b>damage</b> <b>substrates</b> critical for viability of the affected cells.

Using gas chromatography/isotope dilution mass spectrometry, we have detected induction of the oxidative DNA lesions 5 -hydroxycytosine (5 -OH-Cyt), 2, 6 -diamino- 4 -hydroxy- 5 -formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) and 4, 6 -diamino- 5 -formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) in cultured cells irradiated with FL. We followed the repair of these lesions in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XP-A) cells. 5 -OH-Cyt and FapyGua were repaired efficiently in normal cells within 6 h following FL exposure. XP-A cells were unable to repair these oxidative DNA base lesions. Additionally, to compare the repair of oxidative lesions induced by various sources, in vitro repair studies were performed using plasmid DNA damaged by FL, gamma-irradiation or OsO(4) treatment.

40|$|The multiprotein factor {{composed}} of XPA and replication protein A (RPA) {{is an essential}} subunit of the mammalian nucleotide excision repair system. Although XPA-RPA has been implicated in damage recognition, its activity in the DNA repair pathway remains controversial. By replacing DNA adducts with mispaired bases or non-hybridizing analogues, {{we found that the}} weak preference of XPA and RPA for <b>damaged</b> <b>substrates</b> is entirely mediated by indirect readout of DNA helix conformations. Further screening with artificially distorted substrates revealed that XPA binds most efficiently to rigidly bent duplexes but not to single-stranded DNA. Conversely, RPA recognizes single-stranded sites but not backbone bending. Thus, the association of XPA with RPA generates a double-check sensor that detects, simultaneously, backbone and base pair distortion of DNA. The affinity of XPA for sharply bent duplexes, characteristic of architectural proteins, is not compatible with a direct function during recognition of nucleotide lesions. Instead, XPA in conjunction with RPA may constitute a regulatory factor that monitors DNA bending and unwinding to verify the damage-specific localization of repair complexes or control their correct three-dimensional assembly...|$|R

40|$|CO 2, {{known for}} its role in acid-base regulations, is a {{mediator}} of peroxynitrite-induced oxidative damage and it also enhances Cu,Zn-SOD's antioxidant activity. These two means, by which CO₂ affects free-radical damage, are well-explored, {{but there are many}} other mechanisms. When CO 2 joins in free radical reactions, carbonate radical is often produced. The carbonate radical specifically <b>damages</b> <b>substrates,</b> but {{it is not possible to}} generalize, if the effect is pro-oxidant or antioxidant. A protective role of CO 2 has been observed during lipid peroxidation and during peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of DNA, when the carbonate radical caused injury to specific bases, but in the same time it prevented DNA strand breaks. Similarly, CO 2 prevented peroxynitrite- induced protein fragmentation as well as it caused injury to specific aminoacids. These observations are mostly based on experiments in a chemical system, which means under simplified conditions. In vivo, CO 2 exerts much more mechanisms to affect free radical reactions. Under more complex conditions, as cell culture is, there was an increase of oxidative stress after CO 2 exposure. Increased concentration of CO 2 causes a change in erythrocyte's function and an increase of oxidative stress on the organism's level...|$|R

Extract repair within the nucleosome is > 50 -fold more rapid than either enzymatic photoreversal or endonuclease cleavage of the lesion in vitro. Furthermore, nucleosome formation occurs (after repair) only on damaged naked DNA (165 -bp fragments) during a 1 -h incubation in these extracts, even in the presence of a large excess of undamaged DNA.

Several of these XP proteins are characterized by a mediocre preference for <b>damaged</b> <b>substrates</b> over the native double helix but, intriguingly, none of them recognizes injured bases with sufficient selectivity to account for the very high precision of bulky lesion excision.

Through this step-by-step filtering procedure, the XP proteins operate like a systematic decision making tool, generally known as decision tree analysis, to sort out rare damaged bases embedded in a vast excess of native DNA.
