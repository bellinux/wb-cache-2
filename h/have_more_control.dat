5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E
5|$|Late in the season, reports {{began to}} surface that the Canucks would be {{purchasing}} their own AHL team and relocating it. Vancouver wanted to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over personnel decisions for their farm team {{and bought the}} Peoria Rivermen. The Canucks had originally hoped to move the franchise to nearby Abbotsford, British Columbia, which was home of the Calgary Flames AHL affiliate the Abbotsford Heat. Calgary indicated {{they would be willing}} to move their franchise, but a deal between the Canucks and the city of Abbotsford was unable to be reached. With the Abbotsford deal not working out, the Canucks set out to find a new home for their affiliate. They considered moving the team to Vancouver and sharing Rogers Arena, but the city was within the 50-mile territorial radius provided by the AHL. They next considered moving the team to Seattle, Washington, but were not allowed by the NHL. Seattle was a candidate to land the Phoenix Coyotes if a lease agreement could not be reached with the city of Glendale. Eventually, the Canucks decided to relocate their franchise to Utica, New York, creating the Comets.|$|E

In opposing the Medicare bill, Ryun said the bill didn't provide enough reform to keep future costs from soaring.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{the sexual}} {{education}} {{perspective of the}} discourse of desire is very rare in U.S. high schools. This perspective encourages adolescents {{to learn more about}} their desires, gaining pleasure and feeling confident in their sexualities. Researchers state that this view would empower girls because it would place less emphasis on them as the victims and encourage them to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over their sexuality.|$|E

25|$|Age {{plays an}} {{important}} role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.|$|E
25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
25|$|Through the new Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945, {{the board}} was {{replaced}} by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank's administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and exchange control and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on private banks, which later-Governor H.C. Coombs was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank nationalisation in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over their liquidity and attempted to introduce market-based monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of stagflation in 1959.|$|E

25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{took over}} the subway from the Board of Transportation. They {{continued}} to issue Hagstrom maps as official maps until 1956, but instituted two changes. First: from 1954 onwards, they acquired stocks of subway maps designed by Stephen Voorhies and printed with promotional material for the Union Dime Bank. This was done to save money, as the Voorhies map was free, while Hagstrom charged for theirs. To keep the publications valid, the NYCTA periodically sent updated service information to both Hagstrom and Voorhies to be printed in service tables and, where necessary, incorporated into the map. Second: the NYCTA solicited proposals to create an in-house map design to save money and <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> of the map.|$|E
25|$|In some styles or settings, such as {{country music}} clubs or churches, small venues, {{or when a}} live {{recording}} is being made, the drummer may use a transparent perspex or plexiglas drum screen (also known as a drum shield) to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit {{is known as a}} drum booth. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.|$|E

25|$|American International Pictures had {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} of commercial success in the early 1960s with Bava's Black Sunday (1960) and Black Sabbath (1963), as well as dozens of lesser Italian films, including several sword and sandal pictures. Eventually, AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson decided to coproduce some of these films, rather than just pay for the rights to distribute them, in order to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over their content. Planet of the Vampires was one such coproduction, financed by AIP and Italy's Fulvio Lucisano for Italian International Film, along with some Spanish production money provided by Castilla Cooperativa Cinematográfica. AIP provided the services of writer Ib Melchior, whose previous movies had included such modest hits as The Angry Red Planet (1959) and Reptilicus (1961), as well as the relatively big budget Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). Melchior wrote the screenplay for the English-language version of the film, with some assistance from AIP producer Louis M. Heyward.|$|E
25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, private equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control. Finally, private equity firms only take long positions, for short selling is not possible in this asset class.|$|E
500|$|Outsourcing, {{according}} to Grossman and Helpman, {{refers to the}} process of [...] "subcontracting an ever expanding set of activities, ranging from product design to assembly, from research and development to marketing, distribution and after-sales service". Many companies have moved to outsourcing services in which they no longer specifically need or have the capability of handling themselves. This is due to considerations of what the companies can <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over. Whatever companies tend to not have much control over or need to have control over will outsource activities to firms that they consider [...] "less competing". According to SourcingMag.com, the process of outsourcing can take the following four phases.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system was}} designed to allow players {{to have a lot}} of freedom. As a result, the team implemented the [...] "Golden 3C Rules", which represents Character, Control, and Camera. Players are always controlling their own actions and movements, and the team intentionally avoided any animation that would disrupt the players. As a result, actions such as setting explosives, or placing a breach charge, can be cancelled immediately so that players can react and shoot. The game's camera only moves when the player moves, as the team feared that the changes of camera angle may lead to players' in-game deaths. A free-lean system was introduced to the game so that players can <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> on their line of sight. According to Ubisoft, this input-driven control mechanism makes the game feel more [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "fluid". This is because it allows players to concentrate on planning and coordinating, rather than thinking if the camera or environment will interfere their actions.|$|E
500|$|Green {{described}} {{the game as}} both [...] "exceedingly simple ... yet very addictive" [...] and rated it four of five stars. McGrath wrote {{that he wanted to}} <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control</b> over his money, and added that a store for purchasing upgrades would have been useful. He thought that games such as Dunjonquest and Maces and Magic handled this aspect better. McGrath suggested that the player draw their own map {{in the absence of an}} overview mapping system. He felt that his appreciation for the game grew with time and that it had the necessary hook to make him continually return and play again. Tony Roberts of Compute! considered the Commodore 64 version of the game best for its enhanced graphics. The Commodore 64 GHome Companion agreed, stating that it [...] "has some fine sprite graphics and sound effects not found in other versions of the game". Scorpia in 1993 stated that while Telengard was [...] "interesting for its time, the game would be pretty dated today" [...] compared to the Gold Box games; [...] "back then, however, it was hot stuff, and a fun way of passing the time".|$|E
500|$|Curtis chose Notting Hill as {{he lived}} there {{and knew the}} area, saying [...] "Notting Hill is a melting pot and {{the perfect place to}} set a film". This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea of}} building a huge exterior set. That way we would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>control,</b> because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E
