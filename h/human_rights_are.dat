5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the State of Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, that <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E

40|$|A Christian {{theory of}} <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> The {{protection}} of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> a core issue in modern-day ethics. This issue {{can be regarded}} as one of the most important challenges to international politics and in the analysis of social phenomena. In this article a Christian theory of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> presented. With a terminological distinction between fundamental <b>rights</b> and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> this Christian theory is built upon biblical themes such as the imago dei, the Ten Commandments, the lex naturalis and the relation between authority and subject. In conclusion, the Universal Declaration of <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>is</b> evaluated in accordance with this theory...|$|R

There have been no such complaints to date.|$|E
25|$|H. Patrick Glenn {{states that}} sharia is {{structured}} around {{the concept of}} mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people). Bassam Tibi states that sharia framework and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> incompatible. Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish sharia from siyasah (politics).|$|E

The initiative aims to mobilize people in communities to “pursue a community-wide dialogue and to launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on human rights norms and standards.” This approach is different from the traditional way that <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> enforced and applied because of its emphasis on popular education, engagement, and culture as a necessary complement to government enforcement.|$|E
25|$|According to the Republic of Niger's Constitution of 1999, {{most human}} rights, {{as defined by}} the Universal Declaration of <b>Human</b> <b>Rights,</b> <b>are</b> upheld and protected. Despite these protections, {{concerns}} of both domestic and international human rights organizations have been raised over the behavior of the government, military, police forces, and over the continuation of traditional practices which contravene the 1999 constitution. Under French colonial rule (1900–1960) and from independence until 1992, citizens of Niger had few political rights, and lived under arbitrary government power. Although the situation has improved since the return to civilian rule, criticisms remain over the state of human rights in the country.|$|E

25|$|Some make a {{distinction}} between language rights and linguistic human rights because the former concept covers a much wider scope. Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented. Necessary rights, as in <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>are</b> those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), right of access to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.|$|E

25|$|Human {{rights in}} Somalia {{throughout}} the late 20th-century and early 21st-century were considered dire, but have gradually improved {{over the following}} years. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012.

A Human Rights Task Force was also established in February 2013 to firm up on the protection of individual rights.
