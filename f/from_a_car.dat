5|$|Prior {{to making}} landfall, the storm {{produced}} strong waves on the Florida west coast. Following {{a summer of}} tropical moisture in Florida, Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state, peaking at 9.09in (230mm) in Hialeah in the southeast portion of the state. Two other areas experienced over 7in (180mm), though most areas received only light rainfall. In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5in (125mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, {{due to lack of}} many homes in the area. A feeder band in Charlotte County dropped 7in (180mm) of rain in three hours, flooding numerous streets and homes. Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from a feeder band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> crash due to hydroplaning.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics.

Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>car.</b> Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E
