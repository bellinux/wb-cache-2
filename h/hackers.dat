5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that <b>hackers</b> gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by <b>hackers</b> occurred on 19 September. Apparently <b>hackers</b> gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E
5|$|During the war, <b>hackers</b> {{attacked}} Georgian {{government and}} news websites and disabled host servers. Some Russian news websites were also attacked.

5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat <b>hackers.</b> Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat <b>hackers</b> break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and <b>hackers.</b> For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 <b>hackers,</b> of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the <b>hackers</b> had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from <b>hackers,</b> military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six {{acquisitions}} and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than {{selling it to}} pre-existing Juniper clients. Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks. In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive <b>hackers</b> already within the network perimeter. and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems. In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.|$|E

5|$|The Windows {{version of}} Remastered {{was criticized for}} {{suffering}} {{from a number of}} technical issues in the multiplayer, with players also being dissatisfied with the game's available settings for PC. On Steam, it received mostly negative user reviews, with complaints including poor performance, a locked 90 frames per second, inadequate mouse support, numerous <b>hackers,</b> and a low player count. Some users suggested that the multiplayer of Modern Warfare would be a more suitable alternative, which still attracted a sizable amount of players and offered better options for performance, modding and customization.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Steam {{has led to}} the service's being attacked by <b>hackers</b> in the past. An attempt occurred in November 2011, when Valve temporarily closed the community forums, citing potential hacking threats to the service. Days later, Valve reported that the hack had compromised one of its customer databases, potentially allowing the perpetrators to access customer informationincluding encrypted password and credit card details. At that time, Valve was not aware whether the intruders actually accessed this information or discovered the encryption method, but nevertheless warned users to be alert for fraudulent activity.|$|E

5|$|Ubisoft Montreal, the game's developer, studied player {{feedback}} from the first game to assess what could be improved in Watch Dogs 2 and the setting was researched by making frequent trips to California. Ubisoft Reflections was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real <b>hackers</b> were consulted to validate scripts and game mechanics for authenticity and references to real life hacktivism were fictionalized, like the Project Chanology protest. The original soundtrack for Watch Dogs 2 was composed by Hudson Mohawke.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which <b>hackers</b> stole the source code for Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code for the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E
