5|$|Three of Galileo's five {{siblings}} survived infancy.

Michelangelo was unable to contribute <b>his</b> <b>fair</b> share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens {{may have contributed to}} Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving <b>his</b> <b>fair</b> share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the crusade to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero {{was a free}} {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for <b>his</b> <b>fair</b> play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E

Composition royalties were not an issue, as Rourke and Joyce had never been credited as composers for the band. Morrissey and Marr claimed that the other two members of the band had always agreed to that split of the royalties, but the court found in favour of Joyce and ordered that he be paid over £1million in back pay and receive 25% thenceforth.|$|E
