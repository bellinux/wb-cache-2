This is claimed as the origin of the lucky <b>horseshoe.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of <b>horseshoe</b> crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes.

25|$|Around 1000AD, cast bronze <b>horseshoes</b> with nail holes became {{common in}} Europe. Common was a design with a {{scalloped}} outer rim and six nail holes.

5|$|All {{identifiable}} {{fossils of}} Albertosaurus sarcophagus are {{known from the}} upper <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon Formation in Alberta. These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing {{a section of the}} Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon times.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was {{a wide-ranging}} genus in both time and space. The rock units {{from which it}} is known {{can be divided into}} two groups by age: the older <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon and St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon Formation and {{equivalents}} is also known as Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} <b>horseshoe</b> turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, <b>Horseshoe</b> turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second <b>horseshoe,</b> it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

5|$|The Edmontonian land {{vertebrate}} age {{is defined}} by the first appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record. Although sometimes reported as of exclusively early Maastrichtian age, the <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon Formation was of somewhat longer duration.

Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the <b>Horseshoe</b> Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top. As many as three quarters of the dinosaur specimens from badlands near Drumheller, Alberta may pertain to Edmontosaurus.|$|E
