Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E
5|$|Working in {{collaboration}} with the United Kingdom and Canada, with their respective projects Tube Alloys and Chalk River Laboratories, the Manhattan Project, under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, designed and built the first atomic bombs. Groves appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to organize and head the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out. Two types of bombs were eventually developed. Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon that used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The other, known as a Fat Man device (both types named by Robert Serber), was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington. A test <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon,</b> the gadget, was detonated at Trinity Site, on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Linear <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> {{have much}} lower {{efficiency}} due to low pressure, and require 2-3 times more nuclear material than conventional <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons.</b> They are also considerably heavier, and {{much smaller than}} conventional <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons.</b> The W54 nuclear warhead used in the Davy Crockett nuclear artillery unit was about 11 in diameter and weighs 51 lb. The W48 is 6 in in diameter and weighs over twice as much, and probably requires twice as much plutonium. Independent researchers have determined that one model of US conventional <b>implosion</b> fission <b>weapon</b> cost $1.25 million per unit produced, of which $0.25 million was the total cost for all non nuclear components and $1 million {{the cost of the}} plutonium. Linear <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> requiring 2-3 times more plutonium are proportionally more expensive.|$|R
25|$|Neither {{of these}} effects is likely with <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> {{since there is}} {{normally}} insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses. However, the earliest <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some nuclear yield was a concern.|$|R
50|$|Linear-implosion {{weapons have}} much lower {{efficiency}} due to low pressure, and require {{two to three}} times more nuclear-material than conventional <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons.</b> They are also considerably heavier, and much smaller than conventional <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons.</b> The W54 nuclear warhead used for special purposes and the Davy Crockett nuclear-artillery unit was about 11 inches diameter and weighs 51 pounds. The 155 mm W48 is 6 inches in diameter and weighs over twice as much, and probably requires twice as much plutonium. Independent researchers have determined that one model of US Army conventional implosion fission-weapon cost $1.25 million per-unit produced, of which $0.25 million was the total cost for all non-nuclear components and $1 million the cost of the plutonium. Linear-implosion weapons, requiring {{two to three times}} more plutonium, are considerably more expensive.|$|R
25|$|The core of an <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> – the fissile {{material}} and any reflector or tamper bonded to it – {{is known as}} the pit. Some weapons tested during the 1950s used pits made with U-235 alone, or in composite with plutonium, but all-plutonium pits are the smallest in diameter and have been the standard since the early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|A {{neutron bomb}} is only {{feasible}} if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, {{and if the}} yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.|$|E

Other Los Alamos spies—none of whom knew each other—included Theodore Hall and David Greenglass.

5|$|Plutonium–gallium is {{used for}} {{stabilizing}} the δ phase of plutonium, avoiding the α-phase and α–δ related issues. Its main use is in pits of <b>implosion</b> nuclear <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fusion {{reaction}} rate typically becomes significant at 20 to 30 megakelvins. This temperature is reached {{at very low}} efficiencies, when less than 1% of the fissile material has fissioned (corresponding to a yield {{in the range of}} hundreds of tons of TNT). Since <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> can be designed that will achieve yields in this range even if neutrons are present at the moment of criticality, fusion boosting allows the manufacture of efficient weapons that are immune to predetonation. Elimination of this hazard is a very important advantage in using boosting. It appears that every weapon now in the U.S. arsenal is a boosted design.|$|R
500|$|The entire {{plutonium}} weapon design {{effort at}} Los Alamos was soon changed {{to the more}} complicated implosion device, code-named [...] "Fat Man". With an <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon,</b> plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lenses—a technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design, but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes. Enriched uranium, by contrast, {{can be used with}} either method.|$|E
500|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind the}} composite core {{was to make}} better use of the available fissionable material. The use of uranium-235 in an <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields. By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering [...] using both materials in a composite core containing [...] of plutonium and [...] of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos' priority then became {{the development of an}} all-uranium-235 core. By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores. Testing the new levitated, composite and uranium-235 cores would require at least three test firings.|$|E
50|$|The W48 {{was a small}} {{diameter}} linear implosion {{nuclear fission}} weapon. An <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> needs less nuclear material than is required to form a critical mass at normal pressure and configurations, and uses precise explosive assemblies to collapse the material to many times normal density in order to attain critical mass.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review is}} given of blast and {{detonation}} wave phenomena {{and some of}} their uses in war and peace. It is concluded that great strides have been made over the last three decades toward the physical understanding, the analytical-numerical solution, and the measurement of dynamic and thermodynamic quantities, also taking into consideration severe environments and extremely short durations. Questions of internal ballistics are discussed together with hypervelocity launchers and shock tubes, collapsing cylindrical drivers, spherical <b>implosions,</b> explosive <b>weapons,</b> dynamic response, and equation of state data...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{means of}} {{combined}} spectroscopic and radiographic zero-knowledge warhead verification {{has been developed}} and investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. This verification approach, henceforth called "epi-ZK," uses time-structured beams of epithermal neutrons to verify weapon isotopics and geometry without creating or transmitting meaningful information about the device design. This method seeks to remedy information security and hoax resistance issues inherent in previously proposed zero-knowledge verification methods such as fast neutron radiography with preloaded detector arrays and NRF based methods. By {{using a combination of}} epithermal neutron radiography and time-of-flight analysis, the epi-ZK method achieves sensitivity to subtle isotopic and geometric hoaxes, while preserving a high level of information security. Results using a MCNP 5 ¹ model of the verification setup on the "Black Sea Object" pit geometry as well as a speculative HEU <b>implosion</b> <b>weapons</b> design indicate that the method would be highly effective, even using existing research reactor or accelerator neutron sources. This method of verification therefore presents a viable means of verification for weapons previously excluded from treaties such as ST ART {{due to a lack of}} information-secure means of assuring device authenticity. by Jake J.

50|$|Along {{with being}} {{composite}} cores, {{the device was}} the first weapon to rely upon levitated-pit <b>implosion.</b> These early <b>weapons</b> with a levitated pit had a removable pit, called an open pit. It was stored separately, in a special capsule called a birdcage.Various versions of the Mark 4 had explosive yields of 1, 3.5, 8, 14, 21, 22, and 31 kilotons (4 to 130 TJ).|$|R
50|$|The RDS-1 {{explosion}} yielded 22 kilotons of TNT, {{similar to}} the American Gadget and Fat Man bombs. At Lavrentiy Beria's insistence, the RDS-1 bomb was designed as an <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> {{similar to the}} Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan; RDS-1 also had a solid plutonium core. The bomb designers had developed a more sophisticated design (tested later as RDS-2), but rejected it due to the known reliability of the Fat Man type design, the USSR having received extensive intelligence {{on the design of}} the Fat Man bomb during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|To {{achieve a}} large {{explosive}} yield, a linear <b>implosion</b> <b>weapon</b> needs somewhat more material, about 13 kg. The mass, {{known as the}} [...] "pit", is configured in a lower density non-spherical configuration. Tampers or reflectors {{could be used to}} reduce the mass but the overall diameter of the fissile material plus tamper/reflector increases compared to the volume required for an untamped, unreflected pit. To fit weapons into small artillery shells (155 mm or 152 mm are known and 105 mm has been alleged to be possible by nuclear weapon designer Ted Taylor) bare pits are required.|$|E

5000|$|While U-233 {{would thus}} seem ideal for weaponization, a {{significant}} obstacle to that goal is the co-production of trace amounts of uranium-232 due to side-reactions. U-232 hazards, {{a result of}} its highly radioactive decay products such as thallium-208, are significant even at 5 parts per million. <b>Implosion</b> nuclear <b>weapons</b> require U-232 levels below 50 PPM (above which the U-233 is considered [...] "low grade"; cf. [...] "Standard weapon grade plutonium requires a Pu-240 content of no more than 6.5%." [...] which is 65,000 PPM, and the analogous Pu-238 was produced in levels of 0.5% (5000 PPM) or less). Gun-type fission weapons would require low U-232 levels and low levels of light impurities on the order of 1 PPM.|$|R
500|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{conventional}} aerial bombs {{developed by the}} Manhattan Project and used by the United States Army Air Forces against Japan during World War II. The pumpkin bomb was a close replication of the Fat Man plutonium bomb with the same ballistic and handling characteristics, but used non-nuclear conventional high explosives. It was mainly used for testing and training purposes, which included combat missions flown with pumpkin bombs by the 509th Composite Group. The name [...] "pumpkin bomb", which was the actual reference term used in official documents, resulted from the large, fat ellipsoidal shape of the munition casing, meant to enclose the Fat Man's spherical [...] "physics package" [...] (the plutonium <b>implosion</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> core), instead of the more usual cylindrical shape of other bombs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{theoretical}} 100% pure Pu-239 weapon {{could also}} be constructed as a gun-type weapon, like the Manhattan Project's proposed Thin Man design. In reality, this is impractical because even [...] "weapons grade" [...] Pu-239 is contaminated {{with a small amount}} of Pu-240, which has a strong propensity toward spontaneous fission. Because of this, a reasonably sized gun-type weapon would suffer nuclear reaction (predetonation) before the masses of plutonium would be in a position for a full-fledged explosion to occur. Instead, the plutonium is present as a subcritical sphere (or other shape), which may or may not be hollow. Detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere, increasing the density (and collapsing the cavity, if present) to produce a prompt critical configuration. This is known as an <b>implosion</b> type <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|So, {{although}} most neutrons are {{absorbed by the}} casing in a 1-megaton bomb, in a 1-kiloton bomb they would mostly escape. A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1-10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage).

5000|$|The term [...] "radiation implosion" [...] {{suggests}} that the secondary is crushed by radiation pressure, and calculations show that while this pressure is very large, the pressure of vaporized materials caused by it is much larger. The outer layers of the secondary become so hot that they vaporize and fly off the surface at high speeds. The recoil from this surface layer ejection produces pressures which are {{an order of magnitude}} stronger than the simple radiation pressure. The so-called radiation <b>implosion</b> in thermonuclear <b>weapons</b> is therefore thought to be a radiation-powered ablation-drive implosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} {{portable}} nuclear weapons lies {{in their ability}} to be easily smuggled across borders, transported by means widely available, and placed as close to the target as possible.In nuclear weapon design, there is a tradeoff in small weapons designs between weight and compact size. Extremely small (as small as 5 in diameter and 24.4 in long) linear <b>implosion</b> type <b>weapons,</b> which might conceivably fit in a large briefcase or typical suitcase, have been tested, but the lightest of those are nearly 100 lb and had a maximum yield of only 0.19 kiloton (the Swift nuclear device, tested in Operation Redwing's Yuma test on May 27, 1956) The largest yield of a relatively compact linear implosion device was under 2 kilotons for the cancelled (or never deployed but apparently tested) US W82-1 artillery shell design, with yield under 2 kilotons for a 95 lb artillery shell 6.1 in in diameter and 34 in long.|$|R
50|$|This {{became the}} first air-droppable {{thermonuclear}} device, the EC-17, of which only 5 were made and the first deployable staged radiation <b>implosion</b> Teller-Ulam thermonuclear <b>weapon.</b> This evolved into the Mk 17 of which 200 were made. Both of these were huge devices, weighing 39,000 and 42,000 pounds respectively. As a result, they were only capable of being carried by the B-36. They were also {{some of the largest}} yield devices deployed by Strategic Air Command—the EC-17 giving around 10 Mt and the Mk17 between 11 and 15 Mt. They were all out of service by August 1957.|$|R
