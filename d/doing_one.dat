5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> thing with the value, and another thing with the children.|$|E

500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is {{something you have to}} put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people had the luxury of <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} and show runner Greg Daniels stated {{that one of}} the main purposes of [...] "The Deposition" [...] was to add on to the tension building between Michael and Jan.

The scene where Michael pushes Toby's lunch tray off the table was not scripted. The crew was <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> last take of the scene and actor Paul Lieberstein suggested that Steve Carell push his food off the table. The ping pong game between Dwight and Mose was made using Computer-generated imagery. [...] Rainn Wilson and Michael Schur mimed the actions of a ping pong game, and during the stages of editing and post-production the ping pong ball was added in as an effect.|$|E

500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done, called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, the {{bathroom}} scene was reused {{for a series}} of YouTube videos promoting the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series nominations that Family Guy received for consideration to voters for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. In it, Brian considers voting for the fellow nominees—The Office, Flight of the Conchords, Entourage, 30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother, and Weeds. In the first five videos, Stewie brutally beats up Brian for his different votes, in their respective videos, asking [...] "Where's my Emmy man?" [...] and forces him to vote for Family Guy. In the last video, when Brian thinks about voting for Weeds, Stewie doesn't beat him up and instead says, [...] "Oh, fuck this. I'm not <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> for fucking Weeds," [...] referring to the declining quality of the show within it's fourth season.|$|E
500|$|Cake {{incorporates}} {{a wide range}} of genres into its music, including country music, Mariachi, new wave, college rock, jazz, funk, Iranian folk music, Brazilian music and hip hop. McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Zé, the Golden Gate Quartet and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for three things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines, McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics, and his [...] "droll, deadpan...monotone" [...] vocals. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; [...] "A lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey. I like it when it's a contrapuntal thing, where the guitar is <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time".|$|E

Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido summed it up by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d have been better off <b>doing</b> <b>one</b> fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V.

Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green [...] "just doesn't seem to work somehow". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate [...] "Spitfires in space".

Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does not sound like an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a [...] "personal shift" [...] for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is more positive than previous singles such as [...] "We Found Love" [...] and [...] "Where Have You Been", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. Contactmusic's reviewer described it as a [...] "laid-back track", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown.

Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic, and gave it three and a half stars.|$|E
