5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, {{looks for}} relief from his weary watch, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> eyes toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight {{approaches}} the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks {{the passage of}} Time upon the dial of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passingthat relief and rest are close at hand.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Homer {{attend a}} parent-teacher night at Springfield Elementary School. Although Miss Hoover tells Homer that Lisa is doing well, Mrs. Krabappel tells Marge that Bart is {{continually}} causing trouble. Urging Homer and Marge to enforce stronger discipline on Bart {{with the idea}} that he could grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice if <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> life around, the two return home to find that Bart stole and broke Grampa's false teeth. Therefore, Bart is sent up to his room without dinner as punishment, but Homer sneaks up and brings him some pizza, making Bart promise to behave. However, Bart continues to get in trouble and Homer's attempts to discipline him fail. Eventually he promises Marge to make the next punishment stick.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which is pressing on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E

25|$|This {{information}} {{brings a}} lot of emotional turmoil for Hikari even more when she goes to Mao Natsukawa for support and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> back on her, tired of always coming to sloppy seconds to Ooishi. Natsukawa is frustrated with her, since Hikari is always focusing herself on Ooishi even though she always knew deep inside that Ooishi (while he was developing feelings for her at first) always thought {{of her as a}} friend or a little sister.|$|E
25|$|In the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogion of Welsh mythology, Gwydion helps {{his brother}} Gilfaethwy rape Goewin, Math's foot-holder. Gwydion and Gilfaethwy sneak back to Math's court where Gilfaethwy rapes Goewin. When Math hears of this, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> nephews {{into a series}} of mated pairs of animals; Gwydion becomes a stag for a year, then a sow and finally a wolf. Gilfaethwy becomes a hind deer, a boar and a she-wolf. Each year they must mate and produce an {{offspring}} which is sent to Math: Hyddwn, Hychddwn and Bleiddwn; after three years Math releases his nephews from their punishment.|$|E

When the staff wake her up, she has a gash on her arm and Freddy's hat in her possession.|$|E
25|$|Shirley MacLaine {{appeared}} in the 1958 film Some Came Running along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film Around the World in 80 Days. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> face toward the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film Can-Can. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film Ocean's 11 as a drunken woman. The 1984 film Cannonball Run II, with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.|$|E
500|$|Having {{observed}} {{the workings of}} what he thought an alarming tendency of the poetic imagination, as well as Shakespeare's possible aristocratic bias, Hazlitt then observes that, after all, traits of Coriolanus's character emerge, even in this dramatic context, that Shakespeare clearly shows {{to be less than}} admirable. For example, [...] "Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet, the instant he cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> arms against his own country. If his country was not worth defending, why did he build his pride in its defence?" ...|$|E

500|$|Thorpe's {{efforts in}} North Devon came to {{fruition}} in the October 1959 general election, {{when he won}} the seat with a majority of 362 over his Conservative opponent—the Liberal Party's solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for Harold Macmillan's Conservative government. [...] On 10 November 1959 he made his maiden speech, during a debate on the government's local employment bill. He highlighted poor communications as the principal reason for the lack of employment opportunities in North Devon, and called for urgent government action. After the speech a Conservative member looked forward to [...] "many very useful contributions from the hon. Member for Devon, North on any subject to which <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> agile legal brain".|$|E
500|$|The first {{third of}} the novel {{provides}} a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: [...] "Ici se termine, en quelque sorte, l'introduction de cette histoire." [...] ("Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story.") At {{the start of the}} novel, Adeline Hulot– wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot– is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named Célestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the hand of the singer Josépha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine. Mme. Hulot resists Crevel's advances, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> attention elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|The man {{is again}} {{lying on the}} bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before {{opening the door to}} a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.|$|E

500|$|When Black {{opts for}} 10...Bxd2, {{he runs the}} risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 {{variation}} and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation. However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> attention to the queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that [...] "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, {{but in fact it}} is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked. Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E
