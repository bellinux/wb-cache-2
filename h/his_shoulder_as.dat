The band returned to touring {{by the fall}} of 2009.|$|E
25|$|During his and Jack's {{feud with}} The Nasty Boys, Payne had become {{increasingly}} unhappy with their stiffness and insistence on controlling the match. During their brawl at Spring Stampede, Brian Knobbs and Payne did not cooperate on a fall, and Knobbs broke <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> a result. After the match, WCW President Eric Bischoff shouted at Payne for hurting Knobbs, and Payne responded in kind. As a result, he was subsequently buried. He {{was fired from}} WCW soon after, although he did help Jack and his new partner, Kevin Sullivan, defeat The Nasty Boys with a guitar shot.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>As</b> Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin ran back to the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, Bagwell still {{reported}} {{to spring training}} hoping he could contribute in some way during the upcoming 2006 campaign, and to test the injured shoulder. [...] His mere presence in camp put the Astros' insurance claim into further question, creating an awkward situation between the player and the team. [...] He appeared in several games, batting [...]219 with two RBI. [...] He never had to make any difficult throws that would place notable stress on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> the other infielders shifted toward him. [...] As expected, the Astros {{put him on the}} 15-day disabled list in late March with bone spurs in the shoulder. [...] Bagwell disclosed that he was only in good enough condition to play every several days, rather than every day. [...] He was eventually paid the full amount of his contract. [...] The Astros and the insurance company settled the claim in a confidential arrangement the same day he announced his retirement.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on {{the two sides of the}} same item, as if they were the beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E

2500|$|Jerome Lester Horwitz (October 22, 1903 – January 18, 1952), {{better known}} by his stage name Curly Howard, was an American comedian and vaudevillian actor. He {{was best known}} {{as a member of the}} American farce comedy team, the Three Stooges, which also {{featured}} his elder brothers Moe and Shemp Howard and actor Larry Fine. Curly was generally considered the most popular and recognizable of the Stooges. He was well known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expressions ("nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!", [...] "woob-woob-woob!", [...] "soitenly!" [...] , and barking like a dog) as well as his physical comedy (e.g., falling on ground and pivoting on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> he [...] "walked" [...] in circular motion), improvisations, and athleticism. An untrained actor, Curly borrowed (and significantly exaggerated) the [...] "woob woob" [...] from [...] "nervous" [...] and soft-spoken comedian Hugh Herbert. Curly's unique version of [...] "woob-woob-woob" [...] was firmly established by the time of the Stooges' second Columbia film, Punch Drunks (1934).|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, {{the museum}} mounted a third, {{significantly}} larger, exhibition {{centered on the}} novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of The Little Prince: A New York Story celebrated the story's 70th anniversary. It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. [...] "The exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness Saint-Exupéry at work..." [...] wrote the museum's director, William Griswold. It was if visitors were able to look over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.|$|E
2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
