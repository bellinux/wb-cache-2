5000|$|The term [...] "Sheffield Plate" [...] {{is widely}} used these days by those dealing in {{electroplate}} produced in Sheffield, and most collectors prefer {{to use the term}} [...] "Old Sheffield Plate" [...] to identify the early <b>fused</b> <b>plate</b> product described on this page. Another misuse of the term is in describing [...] "Close Plated" [...] ware, which was generally made in Birmingham {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. Close plate consists of silver foil soldered onto a steel base and was used for items such as candle snuffers or cutlery requiring greater strength than <b>fused</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The labrum is a flat {{extension}} of the head (below the clypeus), covering the mandibles. Unlike other mouthparts, the labrum is a single, <b>fused</b> <b>plate</b> (though it originally was—and embryonically is—two structures). It is the upper-most of the mouthparts and located on the midline. It serves to hold food in place during chewing by the mandibles and thus can simply be described as an upper lip.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Boulsover needed {{financial}} assistance {{to set up a}} business in <b>fused</b> <b>plate</b> and it came from Mr Strelley Pegge of Beauchief Hall who loaned him the necessary capital. He went into partnership with Joseph Wilson whose father was a scythe smith at Sharrow, setting up a workshop on Baker's Hill in Sheffield. The main product of the business was to make buttons from <b>fused</b> <b>plate</b> which would cost {{only a fraction of the}} cost of solid silver buttons. Boulsover's buttons were stamped from a die on a fused metal sheet, then cut out, polished and burnished until they were hardly distinguishable from genuine silver. The business also made buckles, spurs and small snuff boxes. Joseph Wilson left the partnership in the mid 1740s, setting up his own business at Sharrow Mills making Sheffield plate items before diversifying into manufacturing snuff for which the Wilsons became World famous. In 1749 Boulsover rented a lease of land in Beeley Wood to build a grinding wheel, but an alteration to the original lease allowed it to be converted into a tilt forge known as the Nova Scotia Tilts.|$|E

50|$|Nesochthamalus intertextus is {{the only}} other Pacific Ocean {{barnacle}} with <b>fused</b> opercular <b>plates.</b> Nesochthamalus possesses a partially calcareous saucer-shaped basis, and <b>fused</b> opercular <b>plates</b> which show no visible trace of former articulation. Rehderella shows a line at the former articulation.|$|R
50|$|Temnopleuridea is an infraorder of {{sea urchins}} {{in the order}} Camarodonta. They are {{distinguished}} from other sea urchins {{by the presence of}} large <b>fused</b> <b>plates</b> on top of the feeding lantern. The test is usually sculpted to some degree, and has perforated tubercles.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Ophiurida and Euryalida (the basket stars) {{have five}} long, slender, flexible, whip-like arms, up to 60 cm in length. They are {{supported}} by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates referred to as vertebral ossicles. These [...] "vertebrae" [...] articulate by means of ball-in-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles. They are essentially <b>fused</b> <b>plates</b> which correspond to the parallel ambulacral plates in sea stars and five Paleozoic families of ophiuroids. In modern forms, the vertebrae occur along the median of the arm.|$|R

40|$|Piezoelectric based bimorph mirrors (PBM) find {{extensive}} use in focusing of x-ray beams. Many optical instruments require use of PBM whose radii of curvature can be tuned precisely. The 100 mm and 300 mm PBMs were fabricated with varying piezoelectric to <b>fused</b> silica <b>plate</b> thicknesses. The radii of curvature of free standing mirrors were measured {{as a function}} of voltage and it was found to decrease with increasing voltage. For a given piezoelectric plate thickness, as the fused silica thickness increases, the radii of curvature was found to increase owing to increase in stiffness of the mirror. On the other hand, for a given <b>fused</b> silica <b>plate</b> thickness, when the piezoelectric plate thickness is increased, the radii of curvature are decreased for a given electric field, due to increase in generated force. This study brings out the influence of piezoceramic to <b>fused</b> silica <b>plate</b> thickness on the radii of curvature of PBM...|$|R
50|$|The ivory {{barnacle}} is a medium-sized, cone-shaped sessile barnacle {{with a white}} test {{composed of}} <b>fused</b> <b>plates.</b> It has a diamond-shaped operculum protected by a hinged lid formed from two triangular halves each consisting of two plates, a tergum and a scutum. It can grow to a height of 2.5 cm but most individuals are much smaller. This barnacle can {{be confused with the}} white bay barnacle (Balanus improvisus) but that species is smaller, only growing to a height of 6 mm. Another similar species is the striped barnacle (Balanus amphitrite) but that has vertical pink lines on the test.|$|R
5000|$|Amphibalanus improvisus has {{a smooth}} white or pale grey conical {{calcareous}} shell composed of six <b>fused</b> <b>plates.</b> There is an oval or rhombic {{opening at the}} top which is blocked by two hinged plates. Adults usually grow to about 10 mm in diameter and 6 mm in width though they are sometimes larger than this and can grow taller when densely packed. The base is characteristically grooved radially. This species can {{be confused with the}} striped barnacle (Amphibalanus amphitrite) [...] and in European waters with the northern rock barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) or the rock barnacle (Balanus crenatus).|$|R
50|$|They are {{distinguished}} from other sea urchins {{by the presence}} of large <b>fused</b> <b>plates</b> on top of the feeding lantern. The test is usually sculpted to some degree, but, unlike their close relatives the Temnopleuroida, the tubercles are never perforated. The opening in the test through which the anus passes, known as the periproct, is unusually large in sea urchins from this group. The apical disc, around the mouth, is only loosely attached {{to the rest of the}} test and is often missing in fossil species, giving the false impression that they also have a large oral opening.|$|R
50|$|Prof. Ian Robertson at the University of Hawaiʻi -Mānoa(UHM) has {{developed}} and tested the steel plate {{connections between the}} masonry. The result was a design method of a <b>fuse</b> <b>plate</b> that yields along its entire length, {{with the aim of}} creating a ductile energy dissipating fuse. Bolt pullout tests were also performed at UHM to validate the strength of the masonry with through bolts. A research team at Rice University develops computational models for the study of hybrid masonry structural systems. Profs. Larry A. Fahnestock and Daniel P. Abrams are performing full scale experimental tests on hybrid masonry at the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation(NEES) site at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.|$|R

2500|$|The {{lower half}} of a sea urchin's body is {{referred}} to as the oral surface, because it contains the mouth, while the upper half is the aboral surface. The internal organs are enclosed in a hard shell or [...] "test" [...] composed of <b>fused</b> <b>plates</b> of calcium carbonate covered by a thin dermis and epidermis. The test is rigid, and divides into five ambulacral grooves separated by five interambulacral areas. Each of these areas consists of two rows of plates, so the sea urchin test includes 20 rows of plates in total. The plates are covered in rounded tubercles, to which the spines are attached. The inner surface of the test is lined by peritoneum. Sea urchins convert aqueous carbon dioxide using a catalytic process involving nickel into the calcium carbonate portion of the test.|$|R

5000|$|The {{configuration}} of the skin ossifications, or osteoderms, {{of the body is}} partly known: no single specimen conserves a complete set. Additional information can be gleaned from the larger specimen MPC 100/1305, a possible Pinacosaurus exemplar. The neck is protected by two cervical halfrings, consisting of keeled rectangular segments fused to an underlying bone band. This band is completely ossified even in juvenile individuals. Godefroit assumed Pinacosaurus differed from other species in having three or four segments instead of the usual six, but Arbour concluded that the normal number was in fact present.The sides of the rump and the tail were occupied by moderately long, flat, recurved, triangular spikes. Parallel rows of smaller oval keeled osteoderms were present on the back. A continuous [...] "sacral shield" [...] on the hip, made of <b>fused</b> <b>plates,</b> is absent.|$|R
50|$|Echinothurioids {{have regular}} tests (shells) with 10 columns of plates. These <b>plates</b> are <b>fused</b> {{in groups of}} three with a central primary plate and a half plate on either side. The edge of each group of plates {{overlaps}} the next one {{in the manner of}} tiles on a roof and this means the test is flexible. These animals usually collapse to a disc shape when brought to the surface. The primary tubercles which articulate with the spines are each perforated by a hole and the spines are hollow. The primary spines are usually long and are used to support the test and in locomotion. In many species, the secondary spines are tipped with poison glands and the urchins should only be handled with gloves. The <b>fused</b> <b>plates</b> continue {{to the edge of the}} jaws, covering the peristome membrane that surrounds the mouth. The mouthparts, known as the Aristotle's lantern, have simple plates and grooved teeth. The gills are relatively small, and in many species, entirely absent.|$|R
50|$|The only {{previously}} known {{fossil record}} was a Miocene occurrence from New Zealand ascribed questionably to Chamaesipho brunnea. No opercular plates {{were present in}} this material, thus exact species placement cannot be determined. Chamaesipho grebneffi from the late Oligocene of New Zealand was recently described by Buckeridge, et al., with opercular plates present. The four completely <b>fused</b> shell <b>plates</b> show that Chamaesipho was fully derived on generic level in Paleogene times.|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of coral {{associated}} barnacle (Balanomorpha: Pyrgomatidae) sharing morphological features of Darwiniella (Anderson, 1992) and Galkinius Perreault, 2014 is described. It has a fused shell and opercular plates, characteristic of Darwiniella. However, the morphology of the tergum and somatic body are closer to Galkinius. Sequence divergence of mitochondrial DNA 12 S rDNA and COI reveals this new species clusters with the Galkinius clade. Therefore this new form is assigned to the genus Galkinius, as G. maculosus sp. n. Concomitantly the diagnosis of Galkinius is emended to include species with <b>fused</b> or four- <b>plated</b> shells and <b>fused</b> opercular <b>plates.</b> The new species is distinct from all Galkinius species in having a fused shell. It inhabits the corals Lobophyllia spp. and is distributed from the Dongsha Atoll in the South China Sea, Orchid Island of Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean, to Madang in Papua New Guinea waters...|$|R
50|$|Echinoida is {{an order}} of sea urchins in the class Echinoidea. They are {{distinguished}} from other sea urchins by simultaneously possessing both an un-sculpted test and a feeding lantern with large <b>plates</b> <b>fused</b> {{across the top of}} each pyramid.|$|R
25|$|Aside from {{scattered}} scales, some specimens do {{appear to}} display imprints, giving {{an indication of}} the structure of the whole animal - which appeared to reach 15–30cm in length. Tentative studies appear to suggest that the fish possessed a more developed braincase than the lampreys, with an almost shark-like outline. Internal scales have also been recovered, some <b>fused</b> into <b>plates</b> resembling gnathostome tooth-whorls to such a degree that some researchers favour a close link between the families.|$|R

50|$|Holland {{was born}} with a defect in his right leg which he had {{corrected}} in seventh grade. They had to break his leg and <b>fuse</b> his growth <b>plates</b> together on both legs which stunted his growth which made it so he could not grow anymore.|$|R
50|$|All ankylosaurians had armor {{over much}} of their bodies, mostly scutes and nodules, with large spines in some cases. The scutes, or plates, are {{rectangular}} to oval objects organized in transverse (side to side) rows, often with keels on the upper surface. Smaller nodules and plates filled in the open spaces between large plates. In all three groups, the first two rows of plates tend to form a sort of half-ring around the neck; in nodosaurids, this comes from adjacent <b>plates</b> <b>fusing</b> with each other (and {{there is a third}} row as well), while ankylosaurids usually have the <b>plates</b> <b>fused</b> to the top of another band of bone.
