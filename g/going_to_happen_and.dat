500|$|To {{promote the}} album, the band ran a contest on MTV. The contest was called, [...] "Lost Weekend" [...] with Van Halen. Fans mailed over 1 million postcards to MTV {{in hopes of}} winning the contest.

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times {{rated the}} episode the 79th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale), {{described}} the episode as [...] "thrilling," [...] but opined {{that the show}} since [...] "has done similar things much better." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating [...] "even though I {{knew he was going}} to go back to the CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying. This is how you identify good TV: When you know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> you still get swept up in it all." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode's ending caused a [...] "huge divide among the writing {{staff and the}} {{director}} and the cast". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to [...] "follow the characters and the emotion of the moment" [...] by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [...] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> so only heard on their mics and came running {{around the corner to}} film." [...] Eventually, both versions were filmed, but the former was broadcast. The alternate version has never been released.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{takes place}} {{immediately}} before the French Revolution and, while not {{discussed in the}} novel, a number of sights and incidents foreshadow the impending events. Clare Clark, in The Guardian, stated [...] "as Baratte's story unfolds, the impending revolution hangs over the narrative like the blade of the guillotine to come", identifying a number of auguries of the future turmoil; including [...] "an organist play to an empty church", the local theatre putting on a production of Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro; and a cart displaying the phrase [...] "M Hulot et Fils: Déménageurs à la Noblesse" [...] on its side (English: M Hulot and Son: Movers to the Nobility). In The Week, Michael Bywater stated {{he felt that the}} novel has [...] "a sense in the air that something decisive is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> happen soon".|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Homer tells Marge: [...] "We were {{so close}} to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>And</b> I {{spent so much time}} {{building}} that trophy case." [...] The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an Academy Award in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film The Killing Fields, was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.|$|E
500|$|A {{co-owner}} for Swedish lifestyle magazine Millennium, Blomkvist {{is devoted}} to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to [...] "go too far". Craig competed with Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Viggo Mortensen, and Johnny Depp as candidates for the role. Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys & Aliens (2011) and Skyfall (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process. Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's bankruptcy, Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part. The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric. Having read the book amid its [...] "initial craze", Craig commented, [...] "It's one of those books you just don't put down" [...] There's just this immediate feeling that bad things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> I think that's part of why they've been so readable for people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz three days after another script idea fell through. [...] Spotnitz noted that [...] "Darin Morgan had left the show but was going to {{contribute}} an episode. And we realized at the eleventh hour that it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> we were stuck with nothing. John, Vince and I broke that story in maybe two days. We split up the acts, wrote it in probably another two days, and gave the crew something to prep before Christmas break. That was the worst ever." [...] Carter ended up rewriting the script over the holiday. The initial cut ended up being too long, resulting in a scene introducing Scully's older brother Bill Scully, played by Pat Skipper, being removed. The character, still played by Skipper, would eventually make his first appearance in the fourth-season finale [...] "Gethsemane". The scene which would have established the character was intended to echo a similar scene in the second season episode [...] "One Breath", which featured Don S. Davis as Scully's father. Both scenes featured the actors standing over a supine Scully, wearing white United States Navy dress uniforms. Also deleted from the episode was a kiss between Mulder and Scully, {{which would have been}} the first in the series' run. This was an ad-lib on Anderson and Duchovny's part, and was removed from the episode as it was something Chris Carter felt he wanted to make use of in the series' film adaptation. Such a kiss was eventually deferred to season six's [...] "Triangle".|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

2500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} of each category {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. All three of the No. 1 Audi drivers felt their turbocharger problem cost them the victory, with Lotterer saying, [...] "When we had the turbo problem we were very disappointed because it's impossible {{to come back from}} that. We were a bit unlucky, but at Le Mans you never know what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> the team motivated me again - they did a great job." [...] Fässler added the team attempted to pressure Toyota but they were unable to catch the Japanese manufacturer: [...] "But this time everyone had problems. We had to be flat out and have no penalties - it isn't easy to do that when you are pushing." [...] Tréluyer stated that winning Le Mans was [...] "emotional" [...] and praised the engineers strategy. The driver felt their approach was like their 2011 victory: [...] "We concentrated on our own race and took the car through until morning. It was the car which had the least bad luck that won.” Kristensen stated he was not unhappy to finish in second and that while his team {{would have liked to have}} had their [...] "little fairy tale" [...] it was still a good result. Di Grassi said it had been [...] "a difficult race" [...] for his team but hoped to return to Le Mans in the future while Gené revealed that did not expect a strong result but that second was [...] "like a fairytale for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NJLA {{supported}} the American Library Association's position in challenging the 2001 Children's Internet Protection Act, which mandates public libraries install pornography filters on computers with Internet access {{in order for}} the libraries to receive federal funding. The Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2003 decision. [...] "Obviously we feel it's a very difficult decision to implement. There's no guidance on how to implement it. There's a lot of confusion about what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> what requirements would have to be followed if federal funds were obtained," [...] said NJLA executive director Patricia Tumulty in a statement about the decision to The Star-Ledger. Tumulty said that the law would disproportionately affect libraries with less available funding. In 2002, the NJLA and corporate sponsor, the Verizon Foundation, started the nonprofit charity program New Jersey Reads to encourage literacy among the 2 million people in New Jersey who have trouble reading. New Jersey Reads was started with US$325,000 in funding from Verizon. In 2003, the NJLA organized a seminar for approximately 150 librarians, educating them on how to protect readers' privacy in light of the USA PATRIOT Act. [...] "We are grappling with this – we are a country at war and everyone wants to be patriotic, but they're forgetting the First Amendment," [...] said one librarian who attended the convention. The association organizes the One Book New Jersey [...] program, and chooses one book for each age group to promote literacy. In 2003, then-First Lady Dina Matos McGreevey was the spokeswoman for One Book New Jersey. One Book New Jersey was developed by the NJLA and the New Jersey State Library.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
