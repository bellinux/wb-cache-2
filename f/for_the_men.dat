5|$|Besides the director, a matron, {{business}} manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp. An educational director {{was responsible for}} creating recreational, social and educational programs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> Church history, Bible and first aid were standard course topics. The strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp, and after nine hours of physical labor, it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes. Most camps had libraries, some showed current films and camp number 56 (Camp Angel) near Waldport, Oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts. Camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E

The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps. The responsibilities of the churches included day-to-day management of the camps, subsistence costs, meals and healthcare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> When the young men arrived at the first camps, they started a six-month experiment that would extend to six years.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> their first meal in 48 hours.

5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, it was time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more settled and time was found <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E

His countryman Abdelhay, the gold medalist from the 2011 Pan Arab Games, was ranked fifth in the same event after Aukhadov was disqualified. Saad, a silver medalist at the 2011 Pan Arab Games who had taken part in the 56 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics, was ninth in the 62 kg event. Abdelbaki, another gold medalist from the 2011 Pan Arab Games and {{a veteran of the}} 62 kg event at the 2008 Summer Olympics, was tenth in the 69 kg class, while Ramadan, also a gold medalist at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, was fifth in the 77kg event.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was also}} {{active in the}} Volunteer Force. It was common {{practice}} in the Volunteer Force <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of a unit to elect their officers although they were sometimes directed by their superiors to vote for certain candidates. Hart was duly elected a lieutenant in the Carterton Rifle Volunteers. When the Volunteer Force was abolished in 1910 and replaced with the Territorial Force, which was organised more like a conventional military, he chose to continue his service. He was well regarded by his superiors and was promoted to captain in 1911. When {{he was promoted to}} major the following year, he was the youngest officer with that rank in his battalion. He was serving with the 1st Battalion of the 17th (Ruahine) Regiment when the First World War broke out.|$|E

They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> the other for women.|$|E
5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a point system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E

Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel. He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but twodays later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.|$|E
