5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> is disputed, though {{it is clear that}} it was {{standing}} at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13thcentury. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe— a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad.|$|E

30|$|Pith {{dates from}} cores were {{transformed}} into establishment dates using an empirically derived relationship between radial and vertical rates of stem growth. Specifically, for all basal stem sections collected from snags in plots within recently burned stands, mean cumulative {{radius of the}} five innermost annual rings at 30 cm height was plotted against the time taken to grow to 30 cm height (JMP 5.0. 1; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The resulting linear correlation (r = 0.73, n = 41, P ≤ 0.001; time to reach 30 cm height [yr] = 8.269 [yr] − 0.849 [yr per mm] × five-year radius at 30 cm height [mm]) was used to calculate {{an estimate of the}} time taken to reach 30 cm height for each tree in the study from which a complete core had been obtained. These times were then subtracted from their respective core pith dates to estimate <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> (i.e., [tree establishment date] = [pith date from core] — [time to reach 30 cm height]). For cores that lacked pith, within-plot averages of these times were subtracted from the inferred pith dates to determine <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b> Once <b>establishment</b> <b>dates</b> had been determined for all individuals within a plot, dates were grouped into 10 yr classes (e.g., 1900 to 1909), plotted as frequency distributions, and visually evaluated (Veblen 1992). Plots exhibiting unimodal frequency distributions were classified as even-aged, and those exhibiting diffuse distributions were classified as uneven-aged.|$|R
