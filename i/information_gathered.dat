5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One of the homes belonged to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van der Sloot. Aruban investigators used <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> Satellite (Jōhō Shūshū Eisei) is a {{satellite}} in a Japanese spy satellite program. It was {{started as a}} response to the 1998 North Korean missile test over Japan. The satellite program's main mission is to provide early warning of impending hostile launches in the neighborhood. This program is under direct control of the cabinet. All of the <b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> Satellites were launched by an H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center.However, Earth observation is a rather new field for Japan. The first Japanese mission in this field MOS-1 was launched only in 1987.|$|R
5|$|<b>Information</b> <b>gathered</b> in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven {{pointed to}} Strasbourg {{as a place}} of {{particular}} interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried out there, and jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the Commission and <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS), {{established}} in 1997, {{is a program}} {{with the purpose of}} monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations.

5|$|Chain of Memories was {{announced}} along with Kingdom Hearts II at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003. Initial details included {{the switch to}} 2D graphics, the use of cards to perform attacks, and that compressed movies would be utilized in some cut scenes. The cut scene animations were rendered using the graphical engine of the PlayStation 2 iteration and then encoded for the Game Boy Advance by using a technology developed by Japanese company, AM3. To help market the game, Disney and Square Enix launched official Japanese websites. A playable demo was first {{made available to the}} public at the 2003 Jump Festa in Japan; this demo and subsequent demos highlighted the card-based combat system. Aside from <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> from the opening sequences, most details regarding the story were kept secret until the release.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues rail is {{believed}} to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. Apart from <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> from subfossil bones, the bird is poorly known and was only documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts, but no such illustrations. The bird was first mentioned by François Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and was named E. leguati in his honour in 1874. The second account was by Julien Tafforet, also marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

40|$|Intuitively {{we believe}} that {{different}} WWW sites have different response time characteristics and that the characteristics change {{during the course of}} the day. These differences are important in the Cooperative <b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> paradigm because agents search and retrieve information on the WWW with real-time constraints. Thus agents must often plan which sites to search and choose between multiple possible sites [...] response time is one factor used in making this choice. In this empirical study we show that different WWW sites have different response time characteristics and that for many sites response times are cyclical within a 24 hour period. We derive regression models for the sites that can be used in Cooperative <b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> and propose future research directions...|$|R
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van der Sloot with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have Van der Sloot prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used <b>information</b> <b>gathered</b> from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek Van der Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted Van der Sloot of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van der Sloot.|$|E

30|$|The ATRS {{architecture}} {{proposed in}} Fig.  7. ATRS can {{be presented at}} four different layers: Presentation, Application, Database, and External Services Layers. The Presentation Layer is mainly responsible for establishing {{a connection between the}} main stakeholders. The Application Layer is the core of the ATRS which contains seven main components (Fig.  7). ATRS Models are the main component of the Application Layer which consists of both Specific ATRS Models and General Models. Specific ATRS Models support the main ATRS aspects: Holism, Adaptation, Integration, and Collaboration. For example, a traveler logs into the ATRS; Travel Workflow Management Model identifies the traveler’s status (Fig.  5) and then executes the other required ATRS models. Travel Process Linkage supports the process integration concepts (Fig.  4). Traveler <b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> Model and Travel Elements <b>Information</b> <b>Gathering</b> Model are for handling the holistic aspects, which are connected with the External Collaboration Engine to <b>gather</b> <b>information.</b> Travel Adaptation Model is responsible for managing adaptation approaches, as well as adaptation triggers such as how to adapt to the different devices and identify the current status of the traveler.|$|R
