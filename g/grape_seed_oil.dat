The oxidation stability of sunflower, corn and <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> was analyzed in the presence of antioxidants in essential oils of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and basil (Ocimum basilicum) during storage, under conditions of accelerated oxidative processes (4 days, at 60 °C). The total phenolic compounds of these essential oils were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The DPPH method was used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of basil, rosemary and thyme essential oils in comparison with known synthetic antioxidant L(+) -ascorbic acid. The addition of essential oils to edible oils, the amounts proposed in analyses, determines a favorable influence on their oxidation stability as well as their taste. The influence of addition of essential oils on the taste of edible oils was studied in two products consumed mainly at breakfast, bread and spinach leaves.

First of all, binary blends of twelve olive oils and one sunflower oil were studied, in order to evaluate the variability associated to the fatty acids profile of olive oils (Monfreda, Gobbi, & Grippa, 2012). In this study, binary blends of twelve olive oils with four types of <b>seeds</b> <b>oils</b> (peanut, corn, rice and <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils)</b> were evaluated. These four groups of blends were analysed and processed separately, each group consisting of 36 samples with 40 %, 50 % and 60 % of olive oil content. Chemometric tools were also applied to the global data set (180 samples, including those analysed in the previous paper). Outstanding results were achieved, showing that the proposed method would be capable to discriminate blends with a difference in concentration of olive oil lower than 5 % (a standard error of prediction of 3. 97 % was obtained with PLS). Therefore blends containing 45 % and 55 % of olive oil were also analysed with the current method and added to the data sets for chemometric assessment with supervised tools. SIMCA still provided good models; however the best performance was achieved by processing each group of binary blends (consisting of 60 samples) separately, rather than applying SIMCA to the overall data set (300 samples).

40|$|International audienceThe {{behavior}} in solution of original structures of amphiphilic partially natural copolymers based on polyoxazoline (POx) (poly(2 -methyl- 2 -oxazoline)) and <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> vegetable <b>oil</b> derivatives (linear, T- and trident-structure) are investigated. The {{results show that}} such systems are found, using dynamic light scattering (DLS), to spontaneously self-organize into monomodal, narrow-size and stable nanoparticles in aqueous medium. The obtained hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) range from 8. 6 up to 32. 5 nm. Specifically, such size increases strongly with increasing natural block (i. e. lipophilic species) length due to higher hydrophobic interactions (from 10. 1 nm for C 19 to 19. 2 nm for C 57). Furthermore, increasing the polyoxazoline (i. e. hydrophilic block) length leads to a moderate linear increase of the Dh-values. Therefore, the first order size effect comes from the natural lipophilic block whereas the characteristic size can be tuned more finely (i. e. in a second order) by choosing appropriately the polyoxazoline length. The DLS results in terms of characteristic size are corroborated using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and also by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging where well-defined, spherical and individual nanoparticles exhibit a very good mechanical resistance upon drying. Moreover, changing the lipophilic block architecture from linear to T-shape and keeping the same molar mass generates a branching and thus a shrinking {{by a factor of}} 2 of the nanoparticle volume, as shown by DLS. In this paper, we clearly show that the self-assemblies of amphiphilic block copolymer obtained from <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> vegetable <b>oil</b> derivatives (sustainable renewable resources) as well as their tunability are of great interest for biomass valorization at the nanoscale level...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{determination}} of fatty acids in processed and/or processed cheese analogues using gas chromatography with FID detection. Characterization of fatty acids, various methods for lipid extraction and the possibilities of determination of fatty acids are described in the theoretical part. Simple and rapid method for the determination of fatty acids in natural and/or processed cheese was optimized and validated in the experimental part. The modified Folch method (by mixture of chloroform - methanol) was selected for lipid extraction from the samples. The standard method (ISO 5509), using a methanol solution of potassium hydroxide, was selected for lipid esterification. Type of the stationary phase and parameters of the column, flow of carrier gas, temperature of the injector, injection technique, temperature of the detector and temperature program were optimized. Calibration curves were constructed from five calibration points (in the concentration range of 0. 01 - 60 g. ml- 1), all correlation coefficients R 2 were higher than 0, 99. The limits of detection and quantification of individual fatty acids ranged from 0. 002 - 6 g. ml- 1. The repeatability of the method was good, all the relative standard deviations of the peaks were below 9 %.

40|$|Protein-fining {{agents from}} {{animal and plant}} sources are used to clarify and {{stabilise}} wines and lower their astringency. Health concerns have been raised {{because most of the}} proteins used for wine fining are derived from allergenic sources. To overcome this problem, this study proposed the use of a <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> protein extract as a new fining agent for wine.

The capacity of the extracts for removing potentially astringent phenols from tannin solutions and from red wines was assessed by determining the Astringency Mucin Index. The perceived astringency intensity in tannin solutions and in two red wines treated with the extracts was evaluated by sensory tests.

In this work, a lipase from Hypocrea pseudokoningii was efficiently linked to four chemical supports: agarose activated with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), glyoxyl-agarose (GX), MANAE-agarose activated with glutaraldehyde (GA) and GA-crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. Results showed {{a more stable}} lipase with both the GA-crosslinked and GA derivatives, compared to the control (CNBr), at 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C. Moreover, all derivatives were stabilized when incubated with organic solvents at 50 %, such as ethanol, methanol, n-propanol and cyclohexane. Furthermore, lipase was highly activated (4 -fold) {{in the presence of}} cyclohexane. GA-crosslinked and GA derivatives were more stable than the CNBr one in the presence of organic solvents. All derivatives were able to hydrolyze sardine, açaí (Euterpe oleracea), cotton <b>seed</b> and <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils.</b> However, during the hydrolysis of sardine oil, GX derivative showed to be 2. 3 -fold more selectivity (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) /docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio) than the control. Additionally, the types of immobilization interfered with the lipase enantiomeric preference. Unlike the control, the other three derivatives preferably hydrolyzed the R-isomer of 2 -hydroxy- 4 -phenylbutanoic acid ethyl ester and the S-isomer of 1 -phenylethanol acetate racemic mixtures. On the other hand, GX and CNBr derivatives preferably hydrolyzed the S-isomer of butyryl- 2 -phenylacetic acid racemic mixture while the GA and GA-crosslink derivatives preferably hydrolyzed the R-isomer. However, all derivatives, including the control, preferably hydrolyzed the methyl mandelate S-isomer. Moreover, the derivatives could be used for eight consecutive cycles retaining more than 50 % of their residual activity.

Turbidity reduction, effects on wine color, polyphenolic content, browning potential and wine sensory attributes were determined. GSE was effective in decreasing white wine turbidity when compared to K-caseinate. In red wine, GSE removed some anthocyanins and proanthocyanins, while wine colour was only slightly affected. The greatest GSE effect was observed on the organoleptic properties of the treated wines, as it drastically reduced the vegetal notes on the rosé wine and improved the overall taste of the red wine {{as a result of the}} reduction in both acidity and astringency.
