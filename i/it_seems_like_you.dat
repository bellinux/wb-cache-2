5000|$|In his book, Beyond Technique (1968), Bruhn {{discussed}} {{his thoughts on}} partnering:It has been noticed that I {{have been able to}} work with many different kinds of ballerinas, and on most occasions we succeeded in becoming a team if only for a season or two. And that is because I always wanted to relate to them. I don't remain the same. Each ballerina is different; she has a special flavor or she wouldn't be a ballerina. This would color my style and shape my approach. I remain true to myself, but I let her flavor color me as mine colors her ... A good partnership can somehow crystallize something that you have been doing already. When the right people come together, they bring the right thing out of each other ... With the right person, it becomes a situation of being rather than playing ...The role absorbs you and you become it. And then <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can do nothing wrong because you are so totally absorbed by this being.|$|E

[...] When asked about the message in a Pitchfork Media interview, Homme said, [...] "I was just fucking with them. Then they asked if they could put that on the end of their record, and I was like, 'Yeah.' I did the vocal [...] "Colony of Birchmen" [...] and sent it back to them, and that message was before the song started." [...] The song itself ends at 5:03, followed by over 16 minutes of silence, then Homme's message.|$|E

It’s almost {{enough to make you}} dig into that half gallon of ice cream you have in the freezer. It’s true that many of us do weigh more than we ought to and that weighing too much is related to certain health risks. That’s just a fact of life, related to science. Our bodies need a certain amount of food to stay alive and work properly, and extra food can make us gain weight. Obesity, or being too heavy for your height, is a serious subject. It’s one of the worst chronic illnesses we now face. Today only one third of Americans weigh a healthy amount.

40|$|In {{terms of}} the {{evolution}} of the strategy, I think that as we move along, we have learned that different people have different expectations and obviously this is not a curative procedure. The disappointing fact was that we were using this procedure for certain conditions which will not resolve and therefore the risk will remain. I think that there are many other centres which have published data regarding their patient selection as to which patients they choose to employ this strategy for management early on, with the idea that the patient will improve and could have a better outcome. But the reality is that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> shift rather than eliminate the risks along the staging process.

For example, patients who had interrupted aortic arch with VSD, posterior mala-lignment type with critical sub AS, and AS with a trachea-oesophageal fistula, or duodenal atresia that needed an operation.

40|$|Having run out {{of sheep}} the other night, I found myself {{counting}} the ways to flip a mattress. Earlier that day I had flipped the very mattress on which I was not sleeping, and the chore had left a residue of puzzled discontent. If you’re going to bother at all with such a fussbudget bit of housekeeping, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to do it}} right, rotating the mattress to a different position each time, so as to pound down the lumps and fill in the sags on all the various surfaces. The trouble is, in the long interval between flips I always forget which way I flipped it last time. Lying awake that night, I was turning the problem over in my head, searching for a golden rule of mattress flipping. The essential characteristic of a golden rule is universality: One rule works all the time, for everyone. The famous archetype of such rules—the one about doing unto others—certainly has this property. So does the rule of the road: “Drive to the right. ” (“Drive to the left” works just as well; what matters is not which side you choose but that everyone make the same choice.) Not all rules generalize so smoothly. A sign saying “Please use other door ” is not helpful when it’s posted on every door. A golden rule of mattress flipping would be some set of geometric maneuvers that you could perform in the same way every time in order to cycle through all the configurations of the mattress. Following this algorithm might entail more physical labor on each occasion—perhaps making multiple flips or turns—but at least it would eliminate the mental effort of remembering. If you too spend sleepless nights fretting over this problem, I’m afrai...|$|E

[...] Fallon said the band had tried to emulate the sound of soul music from the late 1950s, because [...] "back then <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> there was a genuine feeling of excitement going on that I don’t think is necessarily happening right now. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> when <b>you</b> look back on that era {{a lot of it is}} embodied in that Memphis sound, so it’s just a giant celebratory thing." [...] Bassist Alex Levine noted that in addition to being inspired by soul music, he used to use a 1959 Fender Bassman.

We took pride in your maturity and self-belief, supported your growing ambitions, and were continually surprised and humbled by your persistence and willingness to learn from others, and from experience. Others clucked their tongues at the challenges you faced, at the difficult journeys anticipated when you would set-out on some new endeavour. Not once, twice, but time and time again. You never stopped trying, you kept going, never gave in. You're no stranger to difficult times, having seen plenty since coming into this world. Never have you been one to turn your back on those who sacrificed much for this country, always looking forward- past hard times, to the future. You embraced change, no matter how painful, difficult or challenging it was. Each day brings a new tough decision but you soldier on, heart intact, fiercely adaptable, your landscape shaped by the turning tides and changing climes in which you dwell. And if there are indeed places where we would go to remember what life was <b>like</b> when <b>you</b> were young, know that it's simply because everything is changing so quickly. At times, we need to look in both directions in order to know where we are, and where we should go from here; not just for ourselves, but our children-the future of our nation.
