40|$|A mean {{field model}} is {{presented}} that describes droplet growth resulting from condensation and collisions and droplet loss resulting from fallout. The model allows for an effective numerical simulation. The numerical scheme that is conservative in water mass and keeps accurate {{count of the}} number of droplets is applied, {{and the way in which}} the rain initiation time depends on different parameters is studied. In particular, it is shown that the rain initiation time depends nonmonotonically (has a minimum) on the number of cloud condensation nuclei. Also presented is a simple model that allows one to estimate the rain initiation time for turbulent clouds with an inhomogeneous concentration of cloud condensation nuclei. It is argued that by overseeding even a part of a cloud by small <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>nuclei</b> one can substantially delay the onset of precipitation. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} mean-field model of cloud {{evolution}} that describes droplet growth due to condensation and collisions and droplet loss due to fallout. The model {{accounts for the}} effects of cloud turbulence both in a large-scale turbulent mixing and in a microphysical enhancement of condensation and collisions. The model allows for an effective numerical simulation by a scheme that is conservative in water mass and keeps accurate count of the number of droplets. We first study the homogeneous situation and determine how the rain-initiation time depends on the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and turbulence level. We then consider clouds with an inhomogeneous concentration of CCN and evaluate how the rain initiation time and the effective optical depth vary in space and time. We argue that over-seeding even a part of a cloud by small <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>nuclei,</b> one can substantially delay the onset and increase the amount of precipitation...|$|R

40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} and water vapour are two important constituents of the atmosphere. Their interaction, i. e. thecondensation of water vapour on particles, brings about {{the formation of}} cloud, fog, and raindrops, causing the water cycle on the earth, and being responsible for climate changes. Understanding the roles of water vapour and aerosol particles in this interaction has become {{an essential part of}} understanding the atmosphere. In this work, the heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing aerosol particles by the condensation of water vapour in theflow of a capillary nozzle was investigated. Theoretical and numerical modelling as well as experiments on thiscondensation process were included. Based on reasonable results from the theoretical and numerical modelling, an idea of designing a new nozzle condensation nucleus counter (Nozzle-CNC), that is to utilise the capillary nozzle to create an expanding water saturated air flow, was then put forward and various experiments were carried out with this Nozzle-CNC under different experimental conditions. Firstly, the air stream in the long capillary nozzle with inner diameter of 1. 0 mm was modelled as a steady, compressible and heat-conducting turbulence flow by CFX-FLOW 3 D computational program. An adiabatic and isentropic cooling in the nozzle was found. A supersaturation in the nozzle can be created if the inlet flow is water saturated, and its value depends principally on flow velocity or flow rate through the nozzle. Secondly, a particle condensational growth model in air stream was developed. An extended Mason 2 ̆ 7 s diffusion growthequation with size correction for particles beyond the continuum regime and with the correction for a certain particle Reynolds number in an accelerating state was given. The modelling results show the rapid condensational growth of aerosol particles, especially for fine size particles, in the nozzle stream, which, on the one hand, may induce evident `over-sizing 2 ̆ 7 and `over-numbering 2 ̆ 7 effects in aerosol measurements as nozzle designs are widely employed for producing accelerating and focused aerosol beams in aerosol instruments like optical particle counter (OPC) and aerodynamical particle sizer (APS). It can, on the other hand, be applied in constructing the Nozzle-CNC. Thirdly, based on the optimisation of theoretical and numerical results, the new Nozzle-CNC was built. Under various experimental conditions such as flow rate, ambient temperature, and the fraction of aerosol in the total flow, experiments with this instrument were carried out. An interesting exponential relation between the saturation in the nozzle and the number concentration of atmospheric <b>nuclei,</b> including <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>nuclei</b> (HN), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and traditionally measured atmospheric condensation nuclei (CN), was found. This relation differs from the relation for the number concentration of CCN obtained by other researchers. The minimum detectable size of this Nozzle-CNC is 0. 04 ?m. Although further improvements are still needed, this Nozzle-CNC, in comparison with other CNCs, has severaladvantages such as no condensation delay as particles larger than the critical size grow simultaneously, low diffusion losses of particles, little water condensation at the inner wall of the instrument, and adjustable saturation [...] - therefore the wide counting region, as well as no calibration compared to non-water condensation substances...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{have the}} clouds of steam condensate, there must have nuclei of condensation, which can be {{attachment}} with steam and gathered themselves together. The atmosphere contains {{a large number of}} small particles, they play a condensate core role in the process of water vapor condenses into water droplets. <b>Hygroscopic</b> condensation <b>nucleus</b> could reduce the saturation vapor pressure. Make environment relative humidity RH < 100 %, water vapor can condense. On this basis, the paper analyzed the increasing process of the cloud droplets: containing cloud droplets condensation (or sublimation) growth and cloud droplets colliding with each other growth. In {{the early stages of the}} cloud droplets growth, condensation growth is given to priority, collision growth for subordination. When the cloud droplets increases to a certain extent, condensation process will puts secondary status, and gravity collisions growth is given to priority. Finally, the paper analyzed the releasing mechanism of the latent heat and sensible heat in the process of clouds steam vapor condensation and cloud droplets growth: there are obvious leaks in atmospheric physics about the thermodynamic mechanism of cloud formation, the way of phase transition energy transferring to the atmosphere around is not by heat transfer, but in the way of emitting electromagnetic radiation, most of them radiating to the space,just a few of them radiating to the ground. Measuring of atmospheric Extremely low frequency and low frequency radio noise indicates that this view, at the same time, while many scholars have measured out infrared radiation in the experiment of water vapor condensation and Melt content crystallization, these have proved the existence of phase change radiation...|$|R
40|$|Smoke from {{prescribed}} burns can occasionally cause {{significant reduction}} in visibility on highways in the southern United States. Visibility reduction to less than three meters has been coined “superfog” and initial conditions for its formation have been developed previously. Accurate characterization and prediction of precursor conditions for superfog is needed to prevent dangerous low visibility situations when planning prescribed burns. It has been hypothesized that extremely <b>hygroscopic</b> cloud condensation <b>nuclei</b> from the smoldering phase of a fire can produce {{a large number of}} droplets smaller in size than in naturally occurring fog producing superfog conditions at relatively low liquid water content. A thermodynamics-based model for fog formation was developed. Laboratory generated superfog measured by a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer determined that mean droplet radius was 1. 5 μm and the size distribution could be modeled as a log normal distribution. Experiments in an environmentally-conditioned wind tunnel using longleaf pine needle fuel beds provided visibility, heat flux, temperature, humidity, and particle production data for model verification. Numerical modeling was used to approximate the growth of a superfog boundary layer with C H 2 O values of 2 g m - 3 or greater in the Superfog Analysis Model (SAM) which successfully predicted previous superfog events...|$|R
