5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the novel}} focuses on the 1950s timeline, which follows Paul's adventures. After meeting with Paul, Rossi disappears; smears of blood on <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> the ceiling of his office are the only traces that remain. Certain that {{something}} unfortunate has befallen his advisor, Paul begins to investigate Dracula. While in the university library he meets a young, dark-haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She is Helen Rossi, the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi, and she has become an expert on Dracula. Paul attempts to convince her {{that one of the}} librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula, but she is unpersuaded. Later, the librarian attacks and bites Helen. Paul intervenes and overpowers him, but he wriggles free. The librarian is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} schooling, Édouard {{attended}} classes irregularly. According to Dr. J. Maurice Blai, {{because of this}} he spoke English with difficulty and wrote French poorly. He also knew how to speak Cree and Sioux. Édouard quickly outgrew <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and,</b> with the constant teasing he suffered because of his height, he quit school after three years.|$|E

25|$|Later that month, Morrison {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of {{criminal}} libel brought by Jamison. Judge W. S. McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded his fist on <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, than I do this damn desk,” he shouted.|$|E
25|$|The play {{takes place}} in two sets – the hall at Fernley Park and in Poirot's study in his house in the village.

25|$|Buffett {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian, but has since {{described}} himself as agnostic.

25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|After {{his father}} {{received}} a rabbinic appointment, the Ansbacher {{family moved to}} Wiesbaden in 1925, where Joseph attended the Staatliche Gymnasium. When the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933, {{he was one of}} only seven Jews in a student body of around 600, and the only Jew in his class. He endured three years of harassment including an antisemitic insult carved into the top of <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> other students singing popular songs calling for the murder of the Jews. In 1936, all Jewish students were expelled from the public schools, and his parents sent him to the Talmud Torah school in Hamburg, led by Rabbi Joseph Carlebach, where he graduated in spring, 1938. Among the frequent guest lecturers in his senior year was Martin Buber.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E

25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, sits down at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> answers the phone, indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E
500|$|The {{picture in}} Barton's {{room of a}} woman at the beach is a central focus for both the {{character}} and camera. He examines it frequently while at <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> after finding Audrey's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is repeated {{at the end of the}} film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her beauty, he asks her: [...] "Are you in pictures?" [...] She blushes and replies: [...] "Don't be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1944, in a Nazi death camp, Nazi {{scientist}} Klaus Schmidt witnesses a young Erik Lehnsherr bend a metal gate {{with his}} {{mind when he}} is separated from his mother. In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr cannot. In grief and anger, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, child telepath Charles Xavier meets young shapeshifter Raven, whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone [...] "different", like himself, he invites her {{to live with his}} family as his foster sister.|$|E

500|$|During {{his second}} year of {{teaching}} at Command and General Staff School, one of his students, Dwight D. Eisenhower, would come to his office, sit {{on the corner of}} <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> pump him for information, knowing that Middleton had commanded a regiment in combat in France. Eisenhower asked the most practical questions, and was unquestionably motivated—he finished first in his class. [...] Nearly every officer who commanded a division in Europe during World War II attended the Command and General Staff School during Middleton's tenure there from 1924 to 1928. There was also a point in time during World War II when every corps commander in Europe had been a student of Middleton's.|$|E
500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment {{of confusion and}} despair, he opens the drawer of <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> finds a Gideon Bible. He opens it [...] "randomly" [...] to , and reads from it: [...] "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." [...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
50|$|After his death, his {{children}} salvaged {{a large part}} of his work from <b>his</b> old <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> compiled many of his writings, which they published in the book Exiliado en el verso, volumes 1 and 2.|$|R
