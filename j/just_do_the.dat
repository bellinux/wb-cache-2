(1977) and Sweeney 2 (1978). Childs saw Quatermass as a big gamble for Euston, {{out of step with}} the company's usual fare. Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert [...] "didn't want to come in and <b>just</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company". He continues to be one of British television's top producers, responsible for such shows as Chancer (1991), Inspector Morse (1987–2000), Sharpe (1993–2006), Kavanagh QC (1995–2001) and Lewis (2006–present).|$|E

"Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs {{that he wants to}} play that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and <b>just</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> last half.'

Alternative Press noted that Louder Now had a [...] "much more full sound, much more tight" [...] than Where You Want to Be. MTV called the album [...] "a big, ballsy, monster of a rock record," [...] and its title affirms that it is a rock record. The album's sound has been described as alternative rock, emo pop and pop punk.|$|E

500|$|The 2005 final was {{the sixth}} time Liverpool {{had reached the}} final and it was their first {{appearance}} since the 1985 European Cup Final, when they lost 1–0 to Juventus and were subsequently banned from European competition for an indefinite period due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. They had previously won the European Cup on four occasions in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984. The match was Milan's tenth appearance in the final. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost three times (1958, 1993, 1995). In total the teams had participated in 14 finals between them. Prior to the game, Milan were assured of entering the Champions League the following season after finishing second in Serie A. Liverpool meanwhile had failed to finish in the top four in the Premier League, and had to win the final to enter the competition the following season. Even if they did win the match, they were not assured of a place after UEFA failed to confirm whether they would allow Liverpool to defend the championship. The Football Association supported Liverpool, stating, [...] "We have already submitted a written request to have an additional place, should they win the Champions League". Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti said [...] "I think a team that wins {{should have the right}} to defend it but we may <b>just</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> English federation a favour and solve this." ...|$|E

According to Siddharth Kara, who provided CNN with the evidence, he documented 14 cases of child labor within a few days. In reply to a question whether it could have been just a case of kids being present at the construction site along with their parents, he replied: [...] "It's not just kids playing in the dirt or using a hammer as a toy." [...] He further stated about the kids: [...] "They're told to do the work and they <b>just</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> work. They don't know that they should be in school or that they should be playing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the All Blacks {{agreed to}} a request from the Welsh Rugby Union to repeat the {{sequence}} of events from the original match a century before in 1905. This involved the All Blacks performing the haka after [...] "God Defend New Zealand" [...] and before [...] "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau". For the November 2006 test, the Welsh Rugby Union demanded a repeat of this sequence. The All Blacks refused, and instead chose to perform the haka in their changing room before the match. All Blacks captain Richie McCaw defended the decision by stating that the haka was [...] "integral to New Zealand culture and the All Blacks' heritage" [...] and [...] "if the other team wants to mess around, we'll <b>just</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> haka in the shed". The crowd reacted negatively to the lack of the haka and then being shown brief footage of the haka on the screens at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
