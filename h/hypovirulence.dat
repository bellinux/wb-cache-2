5000|$|Hypovirus is {{the only}} genus in the family Hypoviridae. Members of this genus infect fungal {{pathogens}} and reduce their ability to cause disease (<b>hypovirulence).</b> In particular, the virus infects Cryphonectria parasitica, the fungus that causes Chestnut blight, which has enabled infected trees {{to recover from the}} blight. The use of <b>hypovirulence</b> to control blight originated in Europe where the fungal virus spread naturally through populations of European chestnuts. The reduced ability of the fungus to cause disease allowed the European chestnut to regenerate, creating large stands of trees. <b>Hypovirulence</b> has also been found in North America, but has not spread effectively. The [...] "Arner Tree" [...] of Southern Ontario, {{is one of the best}} examples of naturally occurring <b>hypovirulence.</b> It is a mature American chestnut that has recovered from severe infections of chestnut blight. The cankers have healed over and the tree continues to grow vigorously. Scientists have discovered that the chestnut blight remaining on the tree is hypovirulent, although isolates taken from the tree do not have the fungal viruses found in other isolates. Trees inoculated with isolates taken from the Arner tree have shown moderate canker control.|$|E

5000|$|The {{chestnut}} blight is a fungal infection affecting the American Chestnut tree {{that had a}} devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern United States. It later spread {{to other parts of}} the world including Italy. [...] The fungus is spread by wind-borne ascospores and, over a shorter distance, conidia distributed by rain-splash action. In the first half of the 20th Century it killed an estimated 4 billion trees. Infection is local in range, so some isolated American chestnuts survive where there is no other tree within 10 km. There are at least two viral pathogens that weaken the fungus through a mechanism termed <b>hypovirulence</b> that helps trees survive.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, a stand of trees was {{discovered}} near the northeastern Ohio town of Braceville. The stand encompasses four large flowering trees, the largest of which is about 23 m tall, sited among hundreds of smaller trees that have not begun to flower, located in and around a sandstone quarry. A combination of factors {{may account for the}} survival of these relatively large trees, including low levels of blight susceptibility, <b>hypovirulence,</b> and good site conditions. In particular, some stands may have avoided exposure due to being located at a higher altitude than blighted trees in the neighboring area; the fungal spores are not carried to higher altitudes as easily.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the best}} known mycovirus is Cryphonectria parasitica hypovirus 1 (CHV1). CHV1 is {{exceptional}} amongst mycoviral research due its success as biocontrol agent against chestnut blight in Europe, {{but also because it}} is a model organism for studying <b>hypovirulence</b> in fungi. However, this system is only being used in Europe routinely, because of the relative small number of vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) on this continent. In contrast, in North America the distribution of the hypovirulent phenotype is often prevented because fungal hyphae cannot fuse and exchange their cytoplasmic content due to an incompatibility reaction. In the United States of America at least 35 VCGs were found. A similar situation seems to be present in China and Japan where 71 VCGs were identified so far.|$|E
50|$|Hypovirulent phenotypes do {{not appear}} to {{correlate}} with specific genome features and it seems there is not one particular metabolic pathway causing <b>hypovirulence</b> but several. In addition to negative effects, beneficial interactions do also occur. Well described examples are the killer phenotypes in yeasts and Ustilago. Killer isolates secrete proteins that are toxic to sensitive cells of the same or closely related species while the producing cells themselves are immune. Most of these toxins degrade the cell membrane. There are potentially interesting applications of killer isolates in medicine, food industry, and agriculture. A three-part system involving a mycovirus of an endophytic fungus (Curvularia protuberata) of the grass Dichanthelium lanuginosum has been described, which provides a thermal tolerance to the plant, enabling it to inhabit adverse environmental niches.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of mycoviruses have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes and isometric particles, but approximately 30% have positive sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genomes. So far {{there is only}} one true example of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mycovirus. A geminivirus-related virus was found in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum conferring <b>hypovirulence</b> to its host. The updated 9th ICTV report on virus taxonomy lists over 90 mycovirus species covering 10 viral families, of which 20% were unassigned to a genus or sometimes not even to a family. Isometric forms predominate mycoviral morphologies in comparison to rigid rods, flexuous rods, clubshapedparticles, enveloped bacilliform particles, and Herpesvirus-like viruses. The lack of genomic data often hampers a conclusive assignment to already established groups of viruses or makes it impossible to erect new families and genera. The latter is true for many unencapsidated dsRNA viruses, which are assumed to be viral, but missing sequence data prevented their classification so far. So far, viruses of the families Partitiviridae, Totiviridae, and Narnaviridae are dominating the ‘mycovirus sphere’.|$|E
5000|$|Plant pathologists, Drs. William Powell and Charles Maynard, {{working at}} the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, have {{developed}} American chestnuts which have full blight resistance. Full resistance was attained by introducing a wheat gene coding for the enzyme oxalate oxidase into the American chestnut genome. This enzyme breaks down the oxalic acid secreted by the chestnut blight into carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Early studies on <b>hypovirulence</b> showed that less virulent strains of the chestnut blight produced less oxalic acid when attacking the cambium. The transgenic trees produced through this method have blight resistance either equal to or surpassing that of Chinese chestnuts. In 2013, SUNY ESF had over 100 individual events being tested, with more than 400 slated {{to be in the}} field or in the lab for various assay tests in the next several years and more than 1,000 trees growing in several field sites in 2014. Government approval will be required before returning any of these blight resistant trees to the wild. [...] The New York Botanical Garden has planted several of the transgenic trees for public display.|$|E
50|$|DsRNA {{as well as}} ssRNA {{are assumed}} to be very ancient and presumably {{originated}} from the ‘RNA world’ as both types of RNA viruses infect bacteria as well as eukaryotes. Although the origin of viruses is still not well understood, recently presented data which suggest that viruses invaded the emerging ‘supergroups’ of eukaryotes from an ancestral pool in a very early stage of life on earth. According to Koonin, RNA viruses colonized eukaryotes first and subsequently co-evolved with their hosts. This concept fits well with the proposed ‘ancient co-evolution hypothesis’, which also assumes a long co-evolution of viruses and fungi. ‘The ancient coevolution hypothesis’ could contribute some explanation why mycoviruses are so diverse. It has also been suggested that it is very likely that plant viruses containing a movement protein have evolved from mycoviruses by introducing of an extracellular phase into their life cycle, rather than eliminating it. Furthermore, the recent discovery of an ssDNA mycovirus tempted some researchers to suggest that RNA and DNA viruses might have common evolutionary mechanisms. However, there are many cases where mycoviruses are grouped together with plant viruses. For example, CHV1 showed phylogenetic relatedness to the ssRNA genus Potyvirus and some ssRNA viruses, which were assumed to confer <b>hypovirulence</b> or debilitation, were often found to be more closely related to plant viruses than to other mycoviruses. Therefore, another theory arose that these viruses moved from a plant host to plant pathogenic fungal host or vice versa. This ‘plant virus hypothesis’ may not explain how mycoviruses developed originally, but it could help to understand how they evolved further.|$|E
40|$|Double-stranded RNA {{responsible}} for transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> of Cryphonectria (Endothia) parasitica affected {{the accumulation of}} specific polypeptides. Nonhomologous hypovirulence-causing double-stranded RNAs, originating in Europe or North America, affected accumulation of the same polypeptides.

40|$|A single 3 kb {{segment of}} {{double-stranded}} (dsRNA) {{was present in}} three of 30 Brazilian isolates of Cryphonectria cubensis. These dsRNA-containing isolates showed morphological characteristics suggestive of <b>hypovirulence</b> and were significantly less virulent than dsRNA-free isolates. One isolate, however, with morphological characteristics suggestive of <b>hypovirulence,</b> showed reduced virulence, but was free from dsRNA. Conversion of virulent isolates with normal morphology to a morphology associated with <b>hypovirulence</b> was achieved by pairing hypovirulent and virulent isolates of the same vegetative compatibility group (VCG). This suggests that dsRNA can be transmitted to isolates of the same vegetative compatibility group by hyphal anastomosis. Converted isolates exhibited the same hypovirulence-associated traits {{as those of the}} original dsRNA-containing hypovirulent isolates. These studies suggest that a single 3 kb segment of dsRNA alters both morphology and virulence by conferring <b>hypovirulence</b> on the pathogen; the first such report for Brazilian isolates of C. cubensis...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a part of a project focused on the {{relationship}} between dsRNA and <b>hypovirulence</b> in R. solani. <b>Hypovirulence</b> refers to a condition in which a pathogen has a drastically reduced ability to cause disease. Rhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne pathogen causing diseases in numerous plants. Phenyl acetic acid (PAA), a metabolite of phenylalanine, causes Rhizoctonia disease symptoms on potato {{in the absence of the}} pathogen itself. The amount of PAA produced by a hypovirulent isolate is 10 % of that produced by virulent isolates. A 3. 6 kb dsRNA (M 2) has been shown to be associated with <b>hypovirulence</b> in R. solani. Polypeptide A (PA) encoded by the M 2 dsRNA is phylogenetically related to the pentafunctional polypeptide AROM of the shikimate pathway and QUTR, repressor of the quinate pathway in fungi. A hypothesis has been proposed to explain the mechanism of the M 2 dsRNA-mediated <b>hypovirulence.</b> Polypeptide A may interfere with both the shikimate and quinate pathways, leading to a decreased production of aromatic amino acids and PAA, thus leading to a decreased virulence.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> (virulence attenuation) associated with biological control of natural {{populations of the}} chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica can be experimentally reproduced by infection with hypovirus cDNA clones (viral <b>hypovirulence)</b> or by mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{in the absence of}} virus infection (mitochondrial <b>hypovirulence).</b> We now report the use of an established C. parasitica cDNA microarray to monitor nuclear transcriptional responses to an mtDNA mutation of C. parasitica strain EP 155, designated EP 155 /mit 2, which was previously shown to induce elevated alternative oxidase activity and <b>hypovirulence</b> (C. B. Monterio-Vitorello, J. A. Bell, D. W. Fulbright, and H. A. Bertrand, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 5935 - 5939, 1995). Approximately 10 % of the 2, 200 genes represented on the microarray exhibited altered transcript accumulation {{as a result of the}} mit 2 mtDNA mutation. While genes involved in mitochondrial function were clearly represented in the EP 155 /mit 2 -responsive gene list, direct parallels to the well-characterized Saccharomyces cerevisiae retrograde response to mitochondrial dysfunction were not observed. Remarkably, 47 % of the genes that were differentially expressed following the infection of strain EP 155 by the prototypic hypovirus CHV 1 -EP 713 had similarly changed transcript accumulation in the virus-free EP 155 /mit 2 mutant. These results establish a linkage between viral and mitochondrial <b>hypovirulence</b> and raise questions regarding the relationship between hypovirus infection and mitochondrial dysfunction. The combined set of transcriptional profile data provides a foundation for future studies on mitochondrion-to-nucleus communications in the context of hypovirus infection and senescence associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in filamentous fungi...|$|E
40|$|Plant-pathogenic fungi produce cutinase, {{an enzyme}} {{required}} to degrade plant cuticles and facilitate penetration into the host. The absence of cutinase or {{a decrease in}} its production {{has been associated with}} a decrease in pathogenicity of the fungus. A set of isogenic strains of Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus, was tested for the presence and amounts of cutinase activity. The virulent strain of C. parasitica produced and secreted significantly higher amounts of cutinase than the hypovirulent strains. Use of both nucleic acid and polyclonal antibody probes for cutinase from Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi showed that cutinase in C. parasitica is 25 kDa in size and is coded by a 1. 1 -kb mRNA. Both mRNA and protein were inducible by cutin hydrolysate, while <b>hypovirulence</b> agents suppressed the level of mRNA and the enzyme. Since all the strains had the cutinase gene, the suppression of expression was due to the <b>hypovirulence</b> agents. The data presented are the first report indicating that <b>hypovirulence</b> agents in C. parasitica regulate a gene associated with pathogenicity in other plant-pathogenic fungi...|$|E
40|$|Mutations causing {{mitochondrial}} defects were induced in a {{virulent strain}} of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr. Virulence on apples and chestnut trees was reduced in four of six extensively characterized mutants. Relative to the virulent progenitor, the attenuated mutants had reduced growth rates, abnormal colony morphologies, and few asexual spores, and they resembled virus-infected strains. The respiratory defects and attenuated virulence phenotypes (<b>hypovirulence)</b> were transmitted from two mutants to a virulent strain by hyphal contact. The infectious transmission of <b>hypovirulence</b> occurred independently of the transfer of nuclei, did not involve a virus, and dynamically reflects fungal diseases caused by mitochondrial mutations. In these mutants, mitochondrial mutations are further implicated in generation of the attenuated state by (i) uniparental (maternal) inheritance of the trait, (ii) presence of high levels of cyanide-insensitive mitochondrial alternative oxidase activity, (iii) cytochrome deficiencies, and (iv) structural abnormalities in the mtDNA. Hence, cytoplasmically transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> phenotypes found in virus-free strains of C. parasitica from recovering trees {{may be caused by}} mutant forms of mtDNA...|$|E
40|$|A viral {{double-stranded}} RNA {{associated with}} virulence attenuation (<b>hypovirulence)</b> in the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) {{has been shown}} by DNA-mediated transformation {{to be responsible for}} transmissible <b>hypovirulence.</b> In addition to reduced virulence, the fungal strain harboring this virus exhibits a diverse array of characteristics, termed hypovirulence-associated traits, which distinguish it from an isogenic virus-free strain. We have investigated one of these traits, suppressed lac- 1 (laccase) transcript accumulation. Two different and opposing regulatory pathways appear to govern lac- 1 transcript levels in the virus-free strain: a stimulatory pathway was found to be dependent on the inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) and calcium second messenger systems. A second pathway limiting transcript accumulation was shown to require ongoing protein synthesis. Additionally, changes in the level of lac- 1 transcript accumulation were found to be related to modulation of promoter activity and this activity was shown to be suppressed in the virus-containing strain. We conclude that this hypovirulence-associated virus interferes with transduction of an IP 3 -calcium-dependent signal that is required for stimulation of lac- 1 transcription. The perturbation of such signal transduction pathways by hypovirulence-associated viruses may account for the manifold symptoms associated with transmissible <b>hypovirulence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dot blots of dsRNA from European and American hypovirulent (H) {{strains of}} the {{chestnut}} blight fungus, Endothia parasitica, were hybridized with 32 p- 5 '-end-labelled fragments of denatured sRNA of French, Italian and American origins. Although dsRNA from European or American strains reacted well with labelled RNA probes from strains from the same continent there was little or no cross-hybridization between RNA from strains from different continents. <b>Hypovirulence</b> in the chestnut blight fungus Endothia parasitica (Murr.) And. is cytoplasmic-ally controlled. Transmission of cytoplasmic determinants from hypovirulent (H) strains to compatible normal virulent (V) strains following hyphal anastomosis, in the host or in culture, is responsible for conversion of V strains to H forms (Grente & Sauret, 1969 a, b; Van Alfen et al., 1975). Present evidence indicates that dsRNAs, presumably of viral origin, are the cytoplasmic determinants for <b>hypovirulence</b> (Day et al., 1977; Day & Dodds, 1979).

40|$|Transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> {{is a novel}} form of {{biological}} control in which virulence of a fungal pathogen is attenuated by an endogenous RNA virus. The feasibility of engineering <b>hypovirulence</b> was recently demonstrated by transformation of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, with a full-length cDNA copy of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA. Engineered hypovirulent transformants were found to contain both a chromsomally integrated cDNA copy of the viral genome and a resurrected cytoplasmically replicating double-stranded RNA form. We now report stable maintenance of integrated viral cDNA through repeated rounds of asexual sporulation and passages on host plant tissue. We also demonstrate stable nuclear inheritance of the integrated viral cDNA and resurrection of the cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA form in progeny resulting from the mating of an engineered hypovirulent C. parasitica strain and a vegetatively incompatible virulent strain. Mitotic stability of the viral cDNA ensures highly efficient transmission of the <b>hypovirulence</b> phenotype through conidia. Meiotic transmission, a mode not observed for natural hypovirulent strains, introduces virus into ascospore progeny representing a spectrum of vegetative compatibility groups, thereby circumventing barriers to anastomosis-mediated transmission imposed by the fungal vegetative incompatibility system.

40|$|The iconic fungal {{pathogen}} Cryphonectria parasitica, {{the causal}} agent of chestnut blight, {{is known for}} the phenomenon of <b>hypovirulence</b> attributed to dsRNA. <b>Hypovirulence</b> is a trait caused by infection of the fungus with a virus that debilitates the pathogen and is proposed as a potential biocontrol for chestnut blight. C. parasitica has not been officially studied in Texas even though the pathogen has been established a lives on native tree species in eastern Texas. Studies were done by characterizing the morphology and virulence of isolates collected from a tree in Tatum, Texas and compared to known a known hypovirulent isolate and a wild type. The East Texas isolates contained abnormal morphology that are associated traits of <b>hypovirulence</b> such as sectoring, reduced growth, and discoloration. The East Texas isolate (designated Tatum) grew significantly more slowly in vitro than the wild type isolate but more quickly than the known hypovirulent isolate. The virulence assay on apples also found the Texas isolate to be less virulent than the wild type but more virulent than the hypovirulent isolate. These studies could not disprove that the Tatum isolate from East Texas is infected with the hypovirulent virus and will {{provide a basis for}} further investigations on the status of the Texas C. parasitica population...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} have {{focused attention on}} natural forms of disease control as potentially safe and effective alternatives to chemical pesticides. This has led to increased efforts to develop control strategies that rely on natural predators and parasites or that involve genetically engineered microbial pest control agents. This review deals with a natural form of biological control in which the virulence of a fungal pathogen is attenuated by an endogenous viral RNA genetic element: the phenomenon of transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> in the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica. Recent progress in the molecular characterization of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA has provided an emerging view of the genetic organization and basic expression strategy of this class of genetic elements. Several lines of evidence now suggest that specific hypovirulence-associated virus-encoded gene products selectively modulate the expression of subsets of fungal genes and the activity of specific regulatory pathways. The construction of an infectious cDNA clone of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA represents a major advancement that provides exciting new opportunities for examining the molecular basis of transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> and for engineering hypovirulent strains for improved biocontrol. These developments have significantly improved the prospects of using this system to identify molecular determinants of virulence and elucidate signal transduction pathways involved in pathogenic responses. In addition, novel approaches are now available for extending the application of transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> for management of chestnut blight and possibly other fungal diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{double-stranded}} RNA {{responsible for}} transmissible <b>hypovirulence</b> in Cryphonectria (Endothia) parasitica {{was found to}} affect the accumulation of specific poly(A) + RNA.

The highly expressed RNA sequences from these genes were not found in total RNA isolated from either American or European hypovirulent strains, although the genes were present in their genomes. Other virulence- and hypovirulence-specific RNA sequences were also detected. One isolated hypovirulence-specific RNA sequence was expressed in both virulent and hypovirulent cells, but in a two- to fourfold-higher concentration in the hypovirulent cells.

40|$|A viral {{double-stranded}} (ds) RNA {{associated with}} reduced virulence (<b>hypovirulence)</b> {{and the accompanying}} biological control of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, was shown recently to contain two contiguous coding domains designated ORF A and ORF B.

However virulence was not reduced, indicating an apparent uncoupling of associated traits from <b>hypovirulence.</b> These results establish a direct cause and effect relationship between a viral dsRNA genetic element present in a hypovirulent C. parasitica strain and specific phenotypic traits.

40|$|Abstract Background Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is {{a notorious}} plant fungal {{pathogen}} which spreads across the world. <b>Hypovirulence</b> {{is a phenomenon}} where the virulence of fungal pathogens is decreased, even lost, due to mycovirus infection. The potential of hypoviruses for biological control of the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) has attracted much interest, and has led to discovery of new hypovirulent strains in other fungi. Results A hypovirulent strain, strain XG 36 - 1, was isolated from a typical lesion on the stem of rapeseed (Brassica napus) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Strain XG 36 - 1 grew on PDA very slowly (average 2. 5 ± 0. 1 mm/d) with sectoring, and developed abnormal colony morphology with few sclerotia. Unlike health strains (such as wildtype strain XG- 13), it was unable to induce lesions on detached leaves of rapeseed. Sclerotia of strain XG 36 - 1 produced apothecia rarely. A sexual progeny test showed that the phenotypes of all 104 sexual progeny were not different from wildtype strain XG- 13 which shows normal phenotype of S. sclerotiorum, and protoplast regeneration tests showed that 25. 5 % of the regenerants of strain XG 36 - 1 were recovered fully. Furthermore, the <b>hypovirulence</b> and its associated traits could be transmitted to XG 36 - 1 A 34 R, a hygromycin-resistance gene labelled sexual progeny of strain XG 36 - 1, by hyphal anastomosis. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that the cytoplasm of strain XG 36 - 1 was destroyed and granulated; the membranes of nuclei and mitochondria were disintegrated; and mitochondrial cristae were cavitated. Viral particles (about 40 nm) in hyphae of strain XG 36 - 1, but not in its sexual progeny and wildtype strain XG- 13, could be observed with TEM, and several virus-like particles were uniquely enveloped by single layer membrane in the cells of strain XG 36 - 1. Furthermore, the viral particles could be co-transmitted with the <b>hypovirulence</b> traits through hyphal anastomosis. Conclusion <b>Hypovirulence</b> and its associated traits of strain XG 36 - 1 could be mediated by a fungal virus. Currently, we could not know the characteristic of this virus, but it likely represent {{a new type of}} mycovirus in S. sclerotiorum, and possibly in fungi. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mycoviruses {{associated}} with <b>hypovirulence</b> are potential biological control agents {{and could be}} useful to study the pathogenesis of fungal host pathogens. Sclerotium rolfsii, a pathogenic fungus, causes southern blight {{in a wide variety}} of crops. In this study, we isolated a series of dsRNAs from a debilitated S. rolfsii strain, BLH- 1, which had pronounced phenotypic aberrations including reduced pathogenicity, mycelial growth and deficient sclerotia production. Virus-curing and horizontal transmission experiments that eliminated or transmitted, respectively, all dsRNA elements showed that the dsRNAs were involved in the hypovirulent traits of BLH- 1. Ultrastructure examination also showed hyphae fracture and cytoplasm or organelle degeneration in BLH- 1 hyphal cells compared to the virus-free strain. Three assembled cDNA contigs generated from the cDNA library cloned from the purified dsRNA indicated that strain BLH- 1 was infected by at least three novel mycoviruses. One has similarity to the hypovirulence-associated Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirus 2 (SsHV 2) in the family Hypoviridae, and the other two are related to two different unclassified dsRNA mycovirus families.

These findings contradict previous reports correlating the presence of dsRNA with <b>hypovirulence</b> in R. solani. The pathogenic fitness or virulence of certain fungi {{has been shown to}} be diminished by factors uch as mutant nuclear genes, hybrid nuclei or extrachromosomal genetic factors in the nuclei, or by cytoplasmic factors such as viruses, virus-like particles (VLPs), plasmids or organelles carrying genetic material (Elliston, 1982).

This strain had pronounced morphological changes, including reduction in mycelial growth, increased pigmentation, reduced virulence towards wheat, and decreased (60 -fold) production of trichothecene mycotoxins. The {{presence or absence of}} the 7. 5 -kb dsRNA was correlated with the changes in pathogenicity and morphology. The dsRNA could be transferred to virus-free strains by hyphal fusion, and the recipient strain acquired the virus-associated phenotype of the donor strain.

Partial nucleotide sequences of the purified dsRNA identify an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence and an ATP-dependent helicase that are closely related to those of Cryphonectria hypovirus and Barley yellow mosaic virus.

40|$|Bands of {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) {{were detected}} in {{three out of}} twelve isolates of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus. Identity of these bands was confirmed by RNAse, DNAse and S 1 nuclease treatments. The cure of dsRNA for one isolate (P 92) was successfully carried out for a single conidium subculture. Isogenic strains, with or without dsRNA, were submitted to virulence tests against the whitefly Bemicia tabaci strain B. In contrast to findings for some phytopathogenic fungi, these dsRNA fragments did not cause <b>hypovirulence</b> in P. fumosoroseus. 200...|$|E
