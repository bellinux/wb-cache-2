5000|$|The primary {{function}} of the plant cuticle is as a water permeability barrier that prevents evaporation {{of water from the}} <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface,</b> and also prevents external water and solutes from entering the tissues. In addition to its function as a permeability barrier for water and other molecules (prevent water loss), the micro and nano-structure of the cuticle confer specialised surface properties that prevent contamination of plant tissues with external water, dirt and microorganisms. Aerial organs of many plants, such as the leaves of the sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) have ultra-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties that have been described by Barthlott and Neinhuis (1997). The lotus effect has applications in biomimetic technical materials.|$|E
40|$|The leaf {{epidermal}} and organographic {{distribution of}} trichomes studies {{were carried out}} on nine species in four genera in the family Solanaceae. Distinctive anatomical characters which indicate close inter-relationship amongst the genera and species include presence of trichomes on leaf <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> petiole, stem, pedicel, sepal and petal surfaces, amphistomatic leaf surfaces, anisocytic to anomocytic stomatal types, polygonal, occasionally irregular epidermal cell shape on the adaxial <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces</b> and generally lower number of stomata on the adaxial surface. Some characters can be used to separate the genera within the family and also the species within each genus. These include anticlinal walls on the adaxial and abaxial <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> stomatal types in addition to the basic anisocytic to anomocytic stomatal complex types. S. nigrum in the genus Solanum has the highest number of stomatal types. Noteworthy is the presence of protrusions on the stomata of the species in the genus Lycopersicon which is absent in the species of the other genera. The different trichome types have differing organographic distributions within the same species and within the same genus in the family. This can be useful in the identification of the species and even their corresponding organs such as leaf, stem, petiole, etc. which would be of interest to pharmacognosists, archaeobotanists, palaeobotanists and agronomists. Capsicum annuum can be separated from C. frutescens and C. chinense {{on the basis of the}} organographic distribution of the trichomes. Solanum torvum is the only species in the genus Solanum and in the species of the family Solanaceae studied with stellate non-glandular trichomes on the adaxial and abaxial <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The spine-like non-glandular trichome type observed in Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium was completely absent in all the plant parts of Lycopersicon lycopersicum cv Roma VF. This can be used to delimit the two species in the genus. The unique bicellular to multicellular stalk glandular trichomes of Nicotiana tabacum, a mono-species genus in Nigeria are reported. They are believed to be responsible for the unique smell that emanates from N. tabacum. The genus Nicotiana is the only genus in the family with multicellular stalk glandular trichomes...|$|R

50|$|Myoepithelial cells form {{a smooth}} muscle lining around the {{secretory}} cells; when the muscles contract, they squeeze the secretory ducts and push out the accumulated fluid into the hair follicle. Sweat and sebum are mixed {{in the hair}} follicle and arrive mixed at the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface.</b> The apocrine sweat is cloudy, viscous, initially odorless, and at a pH of 6-7.5. It contains water, protein, carbohydrate waste material, and NaCl. The sweat only attains its characteristic odor upon being degraded by bacteria, which releases volatile odor molecules. More bacteria (especially corynebacteria) leads to stronger odor. The presence of axillary hair also makes the odor even more pungent, as secretions, debris, keratin, and bacteria accumulate on the hairs.|$|E
50|$|One genus of mites, Demodex, has {{adapted to}} infesting the hair follicles of its hosts. These mites remain {{external}} to the true outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) which also lines the tube of the hair follicle. However, the mites appear to be deep within the skin {{in the sense of}} being below the general outer surface of the host. The mites fit in the narrow space between the hair and the tube of the follicle. They may also crawl out onto the general <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> of their host. Transmission of these mites from host to host occurs during close contact when young animals are suckled. Demodex mites are morphologically adapted to this constricted habitat: microscopic, worm shaped, and with very short legs. The mites feed on cells of the epidermal lining of the hair follicle. Many species of mammals, including humans, are readily infested with these mites, but typically the density of infestation is very low. However they are considered parasitic in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{structural}} {{characteristics and}} gas-exchange measurements {{were used to}} determine whether photosynthetic tissue of Typha Iatifolia L. (cattail) utilized CO 2 from the aerenchyma gas spaces, part of an internal pathway for gas transport in this wetland species. The partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) in these aerenchyma gas spaces can be more than 10 times atmospheric pCO 2. The photosynthetic tissue occurred in structurally similar adaxial and abaxial palisades, which were distinctly separated from each other by the aerenchyma gas spaces. In each palisade there were three to four layers of tightly packed, nonchlorophyllous cells separating the photosynthetic tissue from the aerenchyma gas space. Different lines of evidence indicated that CO 2 conductance in the light was significantly greater across the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> than across the internal surface of both palisades. However, at an epidermal pCO 2 of 350 [mu]bars and an internal pCO 2 of 820 [mu]bars, the net rates of CO 2 uptake (PN) across the epidermal and internal surfaces were about equal. PN across the internal surface was greater than across the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> at higher internal pCO 2. Gas space pCO 2 can be greater than 820 [mu]bars in the field, and therefore, PN across the internal surface could be a significant proportion of <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> PN...|$|E

40|$|Late {{stages of}} hair {{follicle}} {{development and the}} eruption of the first fetal hairs were studied from several body regions of 15 -, 17 -, and 21 -week-old human fetuses by scanning electron microscopy. At 15 - 17 weeks of age epidermal and subepidermal portions of the follicles were seen from the epidermal basal layer surface as cellular cords that formed the hair tracts (intraepidermal) and hair pegs (dermal). At this stage keratinization was restricted to follicular structures of the scalp; the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> of the entire body was still covered with periderm. By 21 weeks fetal age, various stages in development of hair could be recognized {{in all areas of}} the body by observation of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface.</b> On the lower extremities and buttocks, regularly spaced, elongate ridges marked the position of intraepidermal hair canals which had been excavated within the hair tract. Over certain of these ridges the periderm was interrupted, and keratinized cells that lined the canal were exposed. Hair canals were even longer on the trunk and upper extremities and the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> at these sites had thinned to the extent that hairs contained within the canals were visible within cellular sheaths or were partially released. Long hairs projected {{from the surface of the}} face and scalp, and in these regions exclusively, the interfollicular epidermis also was keratinized. These studies by SEM showed that hairs developed within elongated hair canals which opened at the <b>epidermal</b> <b>surface</b> to release fully elongated hairs.

These results, contrary to the earlier reports, suggest that the inner epidermal mechanical or tactile stimulation does not account for the entire initial rapid growth response. Preliminary experiments indicate that an alternative form of mechanical stimulation (segment excision) may contribute to that portion of initial rapid growth which is not attributable to inner epidermal abrasion...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis trichomes are branched, {{single-celled}} epidermal hairs. These specialized cells {{provide a}} convenient model for investigating the specification of cell fate in plants.

We used constitutively expressed copies of the GL 1 and R genes to test hypotheses about the roles of GL 1 and TTG in trichome development. The results support the hypothesis that TTG and GL 1 cooperate at the same point in the trichome developmental pathway. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of both GL 1 and R in the same plant caused trichomes to develop on all shoot <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Results were also obtained indicating that TTG plays an additional role in inhibiting neighboring cells from becoming trichomes...|$|R

Mutations of IFA- 2 result in epidermal fragility and separation of the apical and basal <b>epidermal</b> <b>surfaces</b> during postembryonic growth. An IFA- 2 lacking the head domain fully rescues the IFA- 2 null mutant, whereas an IFA- 2 lacking the tail domain cannot. Conversely, an isolated IFA- 2 head was able to localize to fibrous organelles whereas the tail was not. Taken together these results suggest that the head domain contains redundant signals for IF localization, whereas non-redundant essential functions map to the IFA- 2, tail, although the tail is unlikely to be directly involved in fibrous organelle localization...|$|R
40|$|Actinic keratosis (AK) is {{a common}} skin disease which can {{potentially}} progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (iSCC). Given that mortality rates and health-care cost associated with iSCC are substantial, the management of AK represents an important public health issue.
