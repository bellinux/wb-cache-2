5|$|Another {{link between}} Europe and the Mongols was {{attempted}} in 1290, when the Genoese endeavored {{to assist the}} Mongols with naval operations.

To build and man the fleet, a squadron of 800 Genoese carpenters, sailors and crossbowmen went to Baghdad, working on the Tigris. However, due to a feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Genoese soon degenerated into internal bickering, and killed each other <b>in</b> <b>Basra,</b> putting an end to the project.
