5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a black man who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E

5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{departed}} Rio de Janeiro on 11 August 1837 for Salvador, {{capital of}} the province of Bahia. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> delivering the prisoner Bento Gonçalves (leader of the rebellion known as the Ragamuffin War that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul since 1835) to a military fortress. On 7 September 1837, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to captain lieutenant. A couple of months later, the Sabinada rebellion erupted in Salvador. The rebels freed Bento Gonçalves, who escaped back to Rio Grande do Sul. Joaquim Inácio {{took part in the}} blockade of that city {{until the end of the}} rebellion in March 1838. His lack of family connections and political influence again stymied his career in 1839, when he was passed over for a well-deserved promotion.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but got only 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had been at the home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> driving carelessly and failing to comply with a red traffic signal; he said he had been unable to attend because he had a dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1885, the Círculo de Trabajadores {{organization}} {{concentrated on}} educational and cultural activities, hosting a secular school for 500 poor students and meetings for workers' groups. The next year, {{leaders of the}} Círculo (with Enrique Creci at the head) formed an aid committee {{to raise funds for}} the legal troubles of eight Chicago anarchists who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder in connection with the Haymarket affair. Within a month and a half, the committee had raised approximately US$1,500 for the cause. In addition, a few days prior to the anarchists executions, the Círculo organized a demonstration of 2,000 people in Havana to protest the state's decision to execute the Americans. The Círculo and El Productor were both fined - the paper for an editorial written by Roig San Martín about the executions, and the Círculo for displaying a painting that commemorated the execution. The colonial government also prohibited the demonstrations that would be held every year on anniversary of the execution.|$|E

5|$|He briefly {{commanded}} the regimental depot, {{before returning to}} the peninsula in 1811 as General Thomas Picton's aide-de-camp, and later assistant adjutant-general (AAG) to Picton's 3rd Division, he received a majority by brevet on 28 April 1812, and a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 26 August 1813. He held the position of AAG {{until the end of the}} Peninsular War in 1814, and received the Gold Cross with two clasps for his services. When an amphibious force was sent to North America in 1814 during the War of 1812, Stovin was appointed its deputy adjutant-general; he was wounded at the Battle of New Orleans. He prosecuted the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Mullins when the force returned to the United Kingdom—Mullins, commanding the 44th Foot, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> neglecting orders during the battle. As a result, although he had been assigned to Picton's staff, he missed the opportunity to serve with him in the Waterloo Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The first U.S. Government {{sponsored}} {{expedition to}} enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River {{and leaving the}} region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E
