30|$|I think that’s a good question, but I’m {{not sure}} I {{can give it}} a very precise answer. I think that, on the {{criterion}} of truth, behavioral theory clearly wins. There is question, because {{some of my friends}} <b>would</b> <b>disagree,</b> but <b>I</b> think it’s fairly clear that the behavioral theory comes closer to accurately describing what goes on in organizations. With respect to beauty, I think it’s fairly clear that economic theory is more beautiful. It’s simpler, it’s more elegant, you can actually derive theorems and all this wonderful stuff. With respect to justice, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that the behavioral theory clearly has an advantage. Economic theory generates people who are greedy and unconcerned about social welfare. That’s a natural consequence of the thinking and the way I’ve talked about justice of a set of ideas is, “Do they create people who make the world better?” In this case, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that economic theory creates people who make the world worse.|$|R

I suspect the work that I’ve done and what the people working with me have done, is focused more on how do rules arise, how do they change, how are they implemented, what kinds of limitations are there and such things. It’s much less functional as it does not try to say, “Do the better rules arise or do the poorer rules arise.” If one just tries to see how rules arise, how are they used. Nelson and Winter’s rules are embedded in an evolutionary framework, and although their evolutionary framework is not the evolutionary framework of simple equilibrium and the reliable outcomes, they are still pushing more and more toward how the system as a whole evolves over time.|$|E

For instance, if Dr Evans would take down his sigmoidoscope from his cupboard, {{he would be able to}} diagnose and treat his own cases of proctitis (not such a very uncommon disease) and monitor their progress. Furthermore, in our area, no case is accepted for barium enema without prior sig-moidoscopy, so that this important investigation would be denied us without a sigmoidoscope, in my view quite correctly. I think that in these days when most general practitioners have access to an almost full range of diagnostic facilities, no case should be presented to a consultant at outpatients without having first been fully "worked up ". The consultant can then perform his proper function for consult-ation with all the apparently relevant facts available to him at the time...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{deficiency}} {{of studies on}} the middle classes especially in Scotland during this period. In looking at the Clackmannanshire middle classes, we have to locate them within the wider context of Britain, Scotland and their urban position within a county seat. The evolution {{of the middle class}} in Scotland became much more rapid after the 1832 Reform Act and their rise from a state of fragmented power and limited collective identity in the mid eighteenth century to great unity and influence by the third decade of the nineteenth century, In Scotland as stated we have a gap in information or studies into the growth and power of the middle classes. There has been some detailed analyse by historians such as Stana Nenadic, Richard Trainer, R J. Morris and Graeme Morton in articles and part histories, also Tony Dickson on Paisley gives us the traditional Marxist lines of class formation and class conflict. We will use all of the above as a basis to form a picture of the middle classes in Scot. Stana Nenadic believes that {{it is not possible to}} explore the Scottish middle class other than within a British context nor he believes desirable, since it was during this period that Scotland was socially integrated with England. An argument <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>disagree</b> with as Scotland was politically aligned with England but socially not quite. Nenadic also states that in 1760 there was no tangible sense of class in Scotland. Therefore the middle classes almost came out of nowhere due to industrialisation and with Scotland's industrialisation coming later than England's the rise of the middle classes was more rapid. Nenadic puts this rise down to the middle classes evolving a sense of identity and collective solidarity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Arthur Danto’s recent book, Andy Warhol, {{leads the}} reader through {{the story of}} the iconic American’s artistic life {{highlighted}} by a philosophical commentary, a commentary that merges Danto’s aesthetic theory with the artist himself. Inspired by Warhol’s Brillo Box installation, art that in Danto’s eyes was indiscernible from the everyday boxes it represented, Danto developed a theory that is able to differentiate art from non-art by employing the body of conceptual art theory manifest in what he termed the ‘artworld’. The strength of Danto’s theory is found in its ability to explain the art of the post-modern era. His body of work weaves philosophy, art history and art criticism together, merging his aesthetic philosophy with his extensive knowledge of the world of art. Danto’s essentialist theory of embodied meaning provides him with a critical tool that succeeds in explaining the currents of contemporary art, a task that many great thinkers of art history were unable to do. If Warhol inspired Danto to create a philosophy of art, it is appropriate that Danto write a tribute to Warhol that traces how Warhol brought philosophy into art. Danto’s account of ‘Warhol as philosopher’ positions him as a pivotal figure in the history of twentieth-century art, effecting a sea change in how art was made and viewed. Warhol achieved this by conceiving of works that embodied the answers to a series of philosophical puzzles surrounding the nature of art. 	Warhol, as Danto describes him, manifests himself in his art because he had transformed himself, in a way, into an icon of the times. This pragmatist notion that art should undermine the dichotomies that exist between art and life would, by some accounts, position Warhol to be the philosopher that Danto claims him to be, for he dissolved the philosophical questions posted by late modern aesthetic thinkers by creating art that imploded the accepted notions of art at the time. One of Danto’s greatest contributions to aesthetics is his theory’s ability to distinguish art from non-art, recognizing that it is the artist’s intention that levels the sublimity of art into the commonplace, thereby transfiguring the everyday. However, acknowledging this achievement, I argue that Warhol’s philosophical contribution actually manifests itself in a manner different from that proposed by Danto. Danto maintains that the internal drive of art leads to the unfolding of art theoretical concepts that ineluctably shift the terrain of world of art. I would agree with Danto that Warhol, almost as Hegel viewed Napoleon as Geist on a horse, pushed forward the boundaries of art through the actualization of art’s internal drive. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>disagree</b> that the conceptual nature of art is one that unfolds merely as a relation of concepts that artists trace through a connection to the meaning of history they forge using their unmediated grasp of style. Rather, I would argue that the artist’s style is not bound so narrowly to the meanings they express. Through their aesthetic articulations, artists initiate a process of social interaction. This process employs the philosophical logic which Danto attributes to Warhol indirectly, and through it, it is able to transfigure the vocabulary of art—the concepts of the artworld—by superseding the language of modernism. Warhol’s philosophical contribution is seen in his mastery of both the medium of art and the underlying logic of the medium’s expression and reception...|$|E
