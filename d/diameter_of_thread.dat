40|$|There are {{two most}} {{commonly}} used methods for calibration of thread rings, with different measuring uncertainty. The method of mechanical sensing with two balls is mostly used on one-axial measuring machines and on coordinate measuring machines. However, the method of calculating the core diameter of the thread ring combined with the technique of adaptation (in accordance with the method of the smallest squares) is used on the profile scanner. The required tolerances, which are very narrow for adjustable and laboratory thread ring, so the measuring uncertainty may be too high when using the method of mechanical sensing with two balls, and the low quality of some control rings, are the decisive factors for choosing an appropriate method in the industry.

Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined.
