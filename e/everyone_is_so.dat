I love the Stamford characters. <b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much fun to work with." [...] This version {{contained}} two new story lines and other minor additions and changes, including Meredith remembering an agreement {{to have sex with}} a coworker {{on the final day of}} employment, Creed selling electronics and furniture from the office, Andy having a plan in case he gets laid off, and Ryan admitting that Kelly has a strange power over him.|$|E
500|$|Teenage Connor is an angry, brooding, intense, and {{volatile}} teenager who is vindictive towards Angel. Vincent Kartheiser {{described him as}} withdrawn and [...] "not willing {{to open up to}} the group happiness <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> inclined to be part of". He also highlighted his 'alienation' of this world and resulting caution and unwillingness to trust others. Tim Minear further characterizes Connor by his strong need for family which [...] "means everything to this kid because he's never had one" [...] and put emphasis on his [...] "conflicted" [...] personality triggered by his upbringing. David Fury and Minear also highlight Connor's similarity to Angel. Fury worked on the resemblance of strength, fighting style, and personality. Minear compared their trait of accepting responsibility even in the worst times. Intending to show Connor as a formidable fighter, Kelly A. Manners described him as [...] "quite the hunter, quite the killer." [...] Kartheiser notes him as [...] "truly badass", and jokingly compares his fighting style to that of 'Jackie Chan', He is attracted to women older than him, which becomes a running gag in the series.|$|E

Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, [...] "Conquering All Obstacles," [...] in which he said: [...] "our raps, not the sorry story raps <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [...] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there.

2500|$|Cold 187um's {{association}} with Insane Clown Posse was criticized by both fans of West Coast hip hop and Juggalos. Cold 187um {{responded to the}} criticism, stating [...] "The Only Solution project was an innovative good idea between myself and Violent J, but <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> damn opinionated these days and not going {{with the idea of}} the artist’s creativity, the project was harder than it needed to be. We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, we all should have been one not separate. That goes for both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans. We might come from different places but we are all on the same side, fighting the same fight. It’s like anything else in life, if there is no unity the real enemy will always win. End of story." ...|$|E

60|$|And the sub-matron {{and two of}} the Board ladies {{had heard}} the compliment. And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn't do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn't for Maria. <b>Everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> fond of Maria.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have done}} well indeed, Ralph," [...] Walter said. [...] "Let us make our way thither at once. <b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> excited in the city, that, as yet, there will be but few guards upon the wall.

50|$|Those with gardens often built Anderson shelters to {{take refuge}} in but not <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{fortunate}} and others had to use crowded public shelters. In late 1940, Morrison shelters were introduced, which were {{not much more than}} a steel table to hide under inside the house. Others made a nightly trek to nearby rural areas, sleeping in tents, cars or even on the beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel a {{different}} woman, Dick. I have not felt {{so well and}} so bright since your father sailed on his last voyage. I am more convinced than ever that we shall succeed. I have been trying very hard, for years, to be hopeful, but now I feel so without trying. Of course, it is partly this lovely weather and the sea air, and sleeping so well; and partly because <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> kind and pleasant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to become a {{permanent}} boarder at your establishment, Major. It is really useless my keeping a cook when I am in here nearly half my time. But I will come.

6000|$|Three cheers {{for dear}} Father! Brooke was a trump to {{telegraph}} right off, {{and let us}} know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, [...] "I'm glad! I'm glad!" [...] Didn't that {{do as well as}} a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't blame yourself, dear," [...] remonstrated the girl, [...] "when {{it was all}} my fault. I begged {{and begged}} and begged until you had to consent, and I'm not sorry either--if nothing happens to you because of our coming.

60|$|But <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{intent upon}} {{enjoyment}} {{that a long}} time went by before gossip occupied itself exclusively with Erös Béla's absence from his pre-nuptial feast. When once it began it raged with unusual bitterness. The scandal during the banquet was being repeated now. Béla was obviously sitting in the tap-room of the inn, flirting with the Jewess, when {{he should have been}} in attendance on his bride.|$|R

5000|$|Pauline Kael {{wrote that}} Pierre Clementi [...] "indicates {{adolescent}} innocence by being loose-limbed and girlish.

500|$|The {{fighting}} and pursuit of McCausland's Brigade endured for about [...] until <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> scattered that pursuit was useless. Many of the Confederates {{were afraid of}} retaliation for their acts in Chambersburg, {{and did not want}} to get caught with the money and items they took. This increased their desperation to flee Averell's men, and caused them to leave their loot behind. A considerable amount of money was recovered from the rebel camps.|$|R
5000|$|Vanity Fair said: [...] "The opening {{sequences}} of War on <b>Everyone</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> furiously fast and funny it's nearly unimaginable that McDonagh can sustain the pace. And yet he does. When the script eases {{up on the}} rapid-fire quips, segueing into hilarious music cues (all that Campbell!) and slapstick violence, it brings its best game. Because these flawed but funny characters have dimension, depth, deep desires and, damn it, cry out for a franchise.’" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1945 a {{painting}} entitled Study of American soldiers standing outside, the Rainbow Corner, North London, {{was sold to}} James Bussy of Sheffield. Her work in portraiture continued apace {{and one of the}} most characteristic paintings, which remained in her own collection, was that of her father, Percy Ebsworth Cheek, in his ARP helmet. She described how <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> debilitated towards the end of war - “not eating properly didn’t help their health and confidence was extremely shaken”.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with Don Hyde by Eddie Wilson 2010, Hyde said that the landlord had tremendous pressure from everywhere to throw them out. He {{went down to the}} VGC a couple of times, unannounced, on a Saturday night, walked around and said “I just don’t see what <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> upset about. It just looks like young people having fun. It is loud! But to each his own.” He told Hyde {{that as long as the}} rent was paid--$350 a month—they could stay.|$|E
5000|$|Alison Willmore of The A.V. Club, also {{praising the}} music, wrote, [...] "Who's {{responsible}} for the killing is never much of a mystery in Small Town Murder Songs; there are no dark conspiracies, only dark natures. The tension instead focuses on whether Stormare {{will be able to}} rein himself in when the investigation inexorably pulls him toward his old life. <b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> restrained, their turmoil buried so deep, that the depth of what they're feeling has to be excavated from what's left unsaid." ...|$|E
50|$|Not <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{optimistic about}} the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport {{suggests}} that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool - that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.|$|E

50|$|Sarah Hamilton-Byrne {{tells how}} Muktananda {{would give a}} private {{audience}} (or darshan) {{once a week to}} Hamilton-Byrne's group. He once asked the children if they would like to leave The Family and live with him at his Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram in Ganeshpuri, India. The children all gave an enthusiastic yes, but were later punished by Hamilton-Byrne for disloyalty. She states that Hamilton-Byrne eventually caused a lot of trouble in the Shree Muktananda Ashram, and some of Muktananda's devotees defected to The Family. Sarah was present when Swami Tejomayananda was initiated into The Family; she states that she could not understand why he would want to join a sect where <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> miserable, when it seemed that <b>everyone</b> around Muktananda <b>was</b> <b>so</b> happy.|$|R
