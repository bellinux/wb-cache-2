5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new <b>independent</b> <b>physician</b> to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

40|$|Background. Various {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on differences in quality measures between different models of primary care with inconclusive results. In Switzerland, up {{to a third of}} the population chooses network health plans including gatekeeping to profit from lower premiums and almost half of GPs work in primary care networks. Objective. To determine differences in the quality of interpersonal care and practice management between patients consulting a physician organized in a GP network or in independent practice. Methods. We analysed data of the European Project on Patient Evaluation of General Practice Care (EUROPEP) questionnaire measuring the quality of the patient-physician interaction and practice management of 473 primary care physicians. From the 25 [*] 178 patients who completed the questionnaire, 72. 2 % (18 [*] 174) consulted a physician participating in a network and 27. 8 % (7004) a <b>physician</b> working in <b>independent</b> practice. Results. The overall answer pattern of EUROPEP questions shows that patients were generally more satisfied with <b>physicians</b> in <b>independent</b> practice. Particularly, questions within the domains ‘relation and communication' and ‘information and support' and to a lesser degree within ‘Medical care' were significantly answered more favourable by patients of <b>independent</b> <b>physicians.</b> Stratification for chronic diseases showed that significant differences favouring <b>independent</b> <b>physicians</b> were less evident in patients with chronic diseases than in the non-chronic group. Conclusions. The results show differences in the quality of interpersonal care and practice management experienced by patients consulting network—or <b>independent</b> <b>physicians.</b> Therefore, we suggest that efforts to reduce health care spending by promoting more integrated care must also focus on monitoring and improving patient perceived qualitie...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{his early}} good opinion of Alberghetti, Merrick's {{relationship}} with the star of his musical turned acrimonious. Merrick refused to release Alberghetti from Carnival to avail herself of a film offer she received four months into the play's run, and when Alberghetti was hospitalized August 6, 1961 for anemia and exhaustion, Merrick reportedly either had an <b>independent</b> <b>physician</b> examine Alberghetti in hospital or had the hospitalized Alberghetti verify her illness in a lie detector test. Merrick loudly championed Anita Gillette, the understudy who played Lili during Alberghetti's ten-day sick leave, stating :"If I'd known she Gillette was this good when we were casting, {{she would have had}} the part", and when the company of Carnival greeted Alberghetti upon her return to the show Merrick presented her with a bouquet of roses variously described as plastic or dead. Gillette's brief stints in the lead of Carnival - she'd relieve Alberghetti during the latter's two-week vacation in December 1961 - had enough impact to launch a Broadway career for Gillette - although Carnival would remain the only hit in which she appeared. Conversely, Alberghetti - despite winning a Tony Award for her role in Carnival (tying with Diahann Carroll) - would never appear in another Broadway production, subsequently refocusing on her cabaret career. She did, however, occasionally appear in regional theatrical productions.|$|E
