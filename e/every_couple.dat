5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

30|$|Family {{life cycle}} theory and natural {{evolution}} theory share a default hypothesis, i.e., the research population (couples) are highly homogenous. Nonetheless, every marriage is de facto different. On the one hand, {{the attractiveness of}} marriage varies from couple to couple and the intensity and frequency of conflicts also varies from couple to couple. On the other hand, <b>every</b> <b>couple’s</b> endurance of marital conflicts {{and the ability to}} deal with them also differ. As a consequence, the marriage satisfaction and divorce risk for <b>every</b> specific <b>couple</b> vary widely at any given point of time. Inspired by the concept of population heterogeneity, Vaupel and Yashin (1985) provided another explanation for the inverted U-shape divorce pattern.|$|R

In the wild, mice are able to co-exist with other small rodent species. Compared with larger mammals, the mouse's small body {{makes it difficult to}} regulate body temperature effectively. Thus, drafts and large fluctuations in temperature can adversely affect the health of mice.|$|E
25|$|Within the Mountain State, these tribal villages can be {{characterized}} as rather small and scattered as they moved about the old fields <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of generations. Many would join other tribes and remove to the midwest regions as settlers arrived in the state. Although, there were those who would acculturate within the historic as sometimes called Fireside Cabin culture. Some are early historic documented seeking protection closer, moving to the easterly Colonial trade towns. And later, other small splintered clans were attracted to, among others, James Le Tort, Charles Poke and John Van Metre trading houses within the state. This historic period changed way of living extends from a little before the 18th century Virginia and Pennsylvania region North American fur trade beginning on the Eastern Panhandle of the state.|$|E

25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and wispy that solar heating {{of dust and}} ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian pottery in the {{southern}} Sinai during the Late Bronze and Early Iron I (Ramesside) periods has been discovered at the mining camps of Serabit el-Khadim and Timna. Objects which bore Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{the same as those}} found in Canaan, were discovered at Serabit el Khadim in the Southern Sinai. Several of these were dated in the later Bronze Age. These encampments provide evidence of miners from southern Canaan. The remote site of Serabit el-Khadem was used for a few months at a time, <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of years at best, more often once in a generation. The journey to the mines was long, difficult and dangerous. Expeditions headed by Professor Mazar examined the tell of Feiran, the principal oasis, of southern Sinai and discovered the site abounded not only in Nabatean sherds but in wheel-burnished sherds typical of the Kingdom of Judah, belonging to Iron Age II.|$|E
25|$|A {{station is}} set by specifying an artist or song, or a {{combination}} of multiple items of any kind in a single station. Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. Each track played can be responded to with favorable (thumbs up) or unfavorable (thumbs down) buttons, which determine if it should be played, and if similarly classified songs should be played in the station. A second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the station's variety. No response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums. An unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track. Clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips. Pandora also utilizes short advertisements between <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of songs.|$|E

30|$|Vaupel and Yashin {{point out}} an {{intrinsic}} defect of traditional survival analysis {{when they first}} explained the concept of population heterogeneity: i.e., {{so long as the}} time (t) of observation is long enough, the probability of any event will be close to 1 (Du 2008). This hypothesis is suitable for certain studies (e.g., studies on death, since death will inevitably happen to everyone at some point); but in terms of studies on divorce, this hypothesis is inadequate because not <b>every</b> <b>couple’s</b> marriage ends in divorce. If we assume that all couples investigated would eventually divorce, the estimated divorce risk function would deviate from reality in a serious way.|$|R
25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts {{that are at the}} end of the {{distribution}} network. Service is also better in winter when the yield of the spring is highest. During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water that comes from the rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do not perceive a water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E

MTV starts its next scheduled program at 8:00pm, while the interview and chat with fans continues on MTV.com for another 30 to 60 minutes. Since its debut in 2011, MTV First has featured high-profile acts such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Usher and Justin Bieber. In the absence of daily live programs such as TRL, It's on with Alexa Chung and The Seven to facilitate such segments, the channel now uses MTV First as its newest approach to present music video premieres and bring viewers from its main television channel to its website for real-time interaction with artists and celebrities.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of entanglement in some hybrid qubit-qutrit systems {{under the influence}} of global, collective, local and multilocal depolarizing noise is studied. It is shown that the depolarizing noise can be used to induce entanglement. A critical point exists under <b>every</b> <b>coupling</b> of the system with the environment at which all the states are equally entangled. Furthermore, it is seen that no ESD occurs when either only the qubit is coupled to its local environment or the system is coupled to multilocal or global environment. This is an important result for various quantum information processing tasks and hence needs further investigation. Comment: Pages 11, Figures...|$|R

Plants are typically watered once <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months.
