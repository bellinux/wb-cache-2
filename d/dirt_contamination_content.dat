40|$|The {{impact of}} regular {{additions}} of a surfactant (ethylene bis-stearamide; EBS) at different time intervals was investigated on the powder {{characteristics of a}} biomedical Ti- 10 Nb- 3 Mo alloy (wt. %). Ball milling was performed for 10 h on the elemental powders in four series of experiments at two rotation speeds (200 and 300 rpm). The addition of 2 wt. % total EBS at different time intervals during ball milling resulted in noticeable changes in particle size and morphology of the powders. The surfactant addition at shorter time intervals {{led to the formation}} of finer particles, a more homogenous powder distribution, a higher powder yield, and a lower <b>contamination</b> <b>content</b> in the final materials. Thermal analysis of the powders after ball milling suggested that differing decomposition rates of the surfactant were responsible for the measured powder particle changes and <b>contamination</b> <b>contents.</b> The results also indicated that the addition of surfactant during ball milling at 200 rpm caused a delay in the alloy formation, whereas ball milling at 300 rpm favored the formation of the titanium alloy.

50|$|Since {{dovetail}} slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is required to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, dovetail slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, dovetail slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and <b>dirt</b> <b>contamination.</b> Dovetail slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric dovetail slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. Dovetail slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and work holding devices. Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, dovetail slides are ideal for high-precision applications.|$|R

An attempt was made to highlight the frequency with which the different forms and contents occur. Six types of obsessions were identified: doubts, thoughts, fear (phobia), images, impulses and miscellaneous. Compulsive acts were classified into two types: yielding and controlling. The contents of obsessions could be classified into eight broad categories as relating to: <b>dirt</b> and <b>contamination,</b> germs, aggression, sex, religion, blasphemy, illness and indecisiveness. Thirty eight percent of the patients displayed obses-sional thoughts related to <b>dirt</b> and <b>contamination,</b> while forty per cent showed religious and blasphemous obsessional thoughts and doubts.

40|$|Errors in gas {{concentration}} measurements by infrared gas analysers can occur during eddy-covariance campaigns, associated with actual or apparent instrumental drifts or biases due to thermal expansion, <b>dirt</b> <b>contamination,</b> aging of components or errors in field operations. If occurring on long timescales (hours to days), these errors are normally ignored during flux computation, {{under the assumption}} that errors in mean {{gas concentration}}s do not affect the estimation of turbulent fluctuations and, hence, of covariances. By analysing instrument theory of operation, and using numerical simulations and field data, we show {{that this is not the}} case for instruments with curvilinear calibrations; we further show that if not appropriately accounted for, concentration biases can lead to roughly proportional systematic flux errors, where the fractional errors in fluxes are about 30 – 40 % the fractional errors in concentrations. We quantify these errors and characterize their dependency on main determinants. We then propose a correction procedure that largely – potentially completely – eliminates these errors. The correction, to be applied during flux computation, is based on knowledge of instrument calibration curves and on field or laboratory calibration data. Finally, we demonstrate the occurrence of such errors and validate the correction procedure by means of a field experiment, and accordingly provide recommendations for in situ operations...|$|R

Studies indicate limited or no systematic differences in eggshell contamination with aerobic bacteria between eggs laid in the nest boxes of furnished cages and eggs laid in conventional cages. The major differences found in experimental studies between cage- and non-cage systems are less pronounced under commercial conditions.

The study focused on the fresh water and sea fish species that Finns mainly use as food. Samples were collected both in harbour and industrial areas with OTC contamination and in areas with no local <b>contamination.</b> OTC <b>content</b> in fresh water fish usually remained under 10 μg/kg fresh weight (fw), but contents measured in four municipalities (Varkaus, Lohja, Jyväskylä and Tampere) were 19 – 28 μg/kg. OTC content of as high as 35, 000 μg/kg (dry weight) was measured in the sediment in Huruslahti Bay, Varkaus, at the depth of 2 – 6 cm. Sea fish showed OTC levels about ten times higher than fresh water areas. OTC content in fish was under 20 μg/kg fw in sea areas with no local <b>contamination.</b> <b>Contents</b> in contaminated areas exceeded 40 μg/kg. Contents of 150 – 500 μg/kg were found in severely contaminated areas. The highest OTC contents (28 – 528 μg/kg) were found in perch caught in Vanhankaupunginlahti Bay in Helsinki. In this case, both the length and weight of fish correlated with the OTC content. High OTC levels were also found in the Naantali Harbour where the level decreased rapidly when moving towards the open sea. The OTC levels in fish caught in the same area varied between different species. Levels found in perch, bream and pike-perch, the preferred habitats of which are in the archipelago and inland bays, were on average higher than levels found in herring, salmon and sprat, which live in the open sea.

Mathematical relationships, determined for all the above cases, define the following characteristics: volume of contaminants captured upstream the interstice, volume of contaminants captured in the interstice, volume of contaminants that flow out downstream the interstice, flow rate of the working flow downstream the interstice as a function of time, average velocity for the working fluid that flows out of the interstice as well as time interval that is necessary to fill in the interstice. Distribution of contaminants along the interstice length is described as well.

It was found that the hexavalent Tungsten was directly reduced in the melt by the free chlorine anion (Cl-) to form the complex ion WCl 6 -. Addition of metal leads to further reduction of pentavalent Tungsten and results to the appearence of the lower valent state complex ion WCl 6 2 -. In addition, Raman spectroscopy was succesfully used for the quantitative determination of the cubic to monoclinic transformation of Zirconia. The significant anti-corrosive and refractory properties of fully stabilized Zirconia in combination with its improved mechanical properties and high ionic conductivity, allowed us to choose FSZ as raw material for the construction of an oxygen sensor appropriate to measure oxide (O 2 -) <b>contamination</b> <b>contents</b> in fluoride melts, during the electro-chemical deposition of refractory metals such as Ta, Nb and W on steel parts. Standard mixtures of monoclinic and cubic Zirconia powders with known composition ranging between 0 and 100 % in cubic phase, were spectroscopically studied to obtain an intensity ratio plot of the bands attributed to both phases against the inverse molar fraction of monoclinic Zirconia.

Of particular importance is determining the effect of ionic impurities (e. g. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, Al 3 +) which may be introduced in widely varying concentrations via starting salts. In addition, organic particulates can contaminate the solution as leachants from growth platforms or via mechanical ablation. Mechanical stresses in the crystals may also play a strong role in the laser-induced damage distribution (LIDD), particularly in the cases of large boules where hydrodynamic forces in the growth tank may be quite high. WE have developed a dedicated, automated damage test system with diagnostic capabilities specifically designed for measured time resolved bulk damage onset and evolution.

The density and the dot size can be easily modified providing a homogeneous, uniform and reproducible standard for the measurement. Based on this method, we designed, de veloped and patented the first industrial instrument for on line determination of the degree of cleanliness of manufactured cold rolled steel plate bobbins.
