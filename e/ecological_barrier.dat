40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>barriers</b> are the riskiest {{phases of}} the annual migrations for migratory birds. Comparatively little field data exists {{pertaining}} {{to the ability of}} migratory birds to prepare for the challenges of crossing <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers,</b> or their ability to recu-perate afterward. Migrating Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) were captured in Eilat, Israel, during their spring and autumn migrations. Data on spring and autumn body masses, their inter-annual variation, and the pattern of body mass in-crease were analysed. The birds show a significant inter-annual variation in their body mass and body condition index in both seasons, which is consistent with the data from other sites and for other passerine species. During stopovers, mass gain occurred in both seasons. Birds in poor initial condition, and those that stop over {{for a longer period of}} time, gained more body mass faster. In spring, but not in autumn, the progress of the season was also an important factor; late-arriving birds gained more fuel faster. The average rate of fuel gain was 0, 157 g·day– 1 ± 0. 018 SE.

40|$|During migration, birds {{spend more}} than 80 % of the time at {{stopover}} sites to rest and refuel before and after crossing ecological barriers such as deserts or seas. Since stopover has intrinsic costs in terms of energy and time, birds should try to minimize its duration, which {{is dependent on the}} combined effects of environmental factors, endogenous programmes, and physiological conditions. Previous studies on long-distance migrants caught after crossing an <b>ecological</b> <b>barrier</b> have indicated that body condition strongly influences the decision whether to prolong stopover or resume migration, with lean birds staying longer than fat birds. In short-distance migrants, evidence is still scarce regarding a determinant role for physiological condition in stopover behaviour after crossing an <b>ecological</b> <b>barrier.</b> Here, we studied whether migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) at a stopover site is dependent on physiological condition in three European short-distance migratory passerines: black redstarts, European robins, and European stonechats. In all species, an integrated measure of condition based on body mass, amount of subcutaneous fat, and thickness of pectoral muscles predicted the intensity of Zugunruhe.

40|$|Bird {{migration}} routes often follow detours where passages across <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are reduced}} in extent. This occurs {{in spite of}} the fact that long barrier crossings are within the birds' potential flight range capacity. Long-distance flights are associated with extra energy costs for transport of the heavy fuel loads required. This paper explores how important the fuel transport costs, estimated on the basis of flight mechanics, map be to explain detours for birds migrating by flapping flight, Maximum detours in relation to expanse of the barrier are predicted for cases where birds travel along the detour by numerous short flights and small fuel reserves, divide the detour into a limited number of flight steps, and where a reduced barrier passage is included in the detour. The principles for determining the optimum route, often involving a shortcut across part of the barrier, are derived. Furthermore, the effects of differences in fuel deposition rates and in transport costs for the profitability of detours are briefly considered. An evaluation of a number of observed and potential detours in relation to the general predictions of maximum detours, indicates that reduction of fuel transport costs may well be a factor of widespread importance for the evolution of detours in bird migration at wide <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers.</b> (C) 2001 Academic Press...|$|R

The analysis indicated that the evolution of migratory links among arctic shorebirds is constrained not by distance as such but by distance across <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers,</b> possibly because of the complex adaptations required for barrier crossing and extensive detour migration (and {{in a few cases}} because barrier distances exceed the birds' theoretical flight range capacity). A particularly pronounced barrier effect of the Arctic Ocean, as apparent from a sharp decline in migratory connectivity between the opposite sides of the Arctic Ocean, may reflect a crucial importance of favourable entry and exit conditions for successfully occupying different sectors of the tundra breeding area by shorebirds from winter regions situated at widely different total distances in both the southern and northern hemispheres...|$|R

40|$|During Serravallian, the {{emersion}} of the Carpathians {{and of the}} Alpine foreland domain {{closed the}} northern connection between the western and the eastern Tethys. In the late Miocene this latter became subdivided into several basins (Vienna Basin, Pannonian Basin, Dacic Basin, Ponto-Euxinic Basin and Caspian-Aral Basin) which, due to the freshwater input from several important rivers, were progressively characterised by brackish waters. The connection via the present Dardanelli straight was still open but the different salinity between western and eastern Tethys represented an <b>ecological</b> <b>barrier,</b> preventing the faunistic exchanges and causing the onset of two different Late Miocene bioprovinces: the Paleomediterranean bioprovince {{to the west and}} the Paratethyan bioprovince to the east. Notwithstanding the Late Miocene isolation of Paleomediterranean from Paratethys, during Late Tortonian-early Messinian it is possible to recognise in Italy few brackish and freshwater ostracods with Paratethyan affinity. The palaeogeography of the area prevents to suppose a normal aquatic migration, and, indeed, the distribution of several Paratethyan genera seems disjuncted. In this case, only a passive dispersal by aquatic birds can be claimed. Paratethyan genera transported in Italy are Camptocypria (Sirmiella), Bakunella, Propontoniella, Labiatocandona, Zalanyiella (all included in the Subfamily Candoninae), Loxoconchissa s. s. and Loxoconchissa (Loxocaspia), included in Family Loxoconchidae and Amnicythere (and may be Chartocythere and Mediocytherideis) included in Family Leptocytheridae. During the latest Messinian lago-mare event, the closure of the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection and the subsequent humid global climate phase caused a salinity lowering of the Paleomediterranean waters. The <b>ecological</b> <b>barrier</b> between Paleomediterranean and Paratethys was disrupted and an important contingent of Paratethyan ostracods migrated westwards colonising the Paleomediterranean, whose endemic fauna was severely impoverished by the Messinian salinity crisis and the following water dilution. The Italian (and Paleomediterranean) latest Messinian lago-mare deposits are characterised by Paratethyan species such as Caspiocypris pontica, Lineocypris cf. L. fossulata, Lineocypris cf.

40|$|Geographically {{separated}} populations {{tend to be}} less {{connected by}} gene flow, as a result of physical or non-physical barriers preventing dispersal, and this can lead to genetic structure. In this context, highly mobile organisms such as seabirds are interesting because the small effect of physical barriers means non-physical ones may be relatively more important. Here we use microsatellite and mitochondrial data to explore the genetic structure and phylogeography of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of a European endemic seabird, the European Shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis, and identify the primary drivers of their diversification. Analyses of mitochondrial markers revealed three phylogenetic lineages grouping the North Atlantic, Spanish/Corsican and Eastern Mediterranean populations, apparently arising from fragmentation during the Pleistocene followed by range expansion. These traces of historical fragmentation were also evident in the genetic structure estimated by microsatellite markers, despite significant contemporary gene flow among adjacent populations.

40|$|The {{house mouse}} (Mus musculus), after humans, {{is the most}} {{widespread}} mammal on earth {{and one of the}} worst invasive species for both biological diversity and human health. This ubiquity is the consequence of its strong ecological relationship with humans, namely commensalism. Human activities promote its diffusion by eliminating <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers</b> and by increasing the human environment suitable for this species. This paper deals with recent zooarchaeological data that has helped to decipher the main factors of human evolution involved in the origin of commensal behaviour in the house mouse and in its invasive process throughout the Mediterranean. Understanding this process contributes to our overall knowledge on how human activities modelled mammalian diversity during Holocene. In the Near Eastern core of European Neolithisation, two factors are recognised as the main driving forces to explain the beginning of house mouse commensalism: rise of farming practices (cultivated fields, large scale grain storage, domestication of plants) and human dispersal of domesticated plants through the cultural area of the pre-ceramic Neolithic. These factors increased the attractiveness of the anthropic ecosystem as well as the diffusion vectors of mice by passive transport. Nevertheless, the Neolithisation of the Mediterranean did not promote the house mouse’s invasion of Europe. The commercial and demographic expansions of Phoenicians and Greeks during the last millennium bc were the vectors that allowed the house mouse to overwhelm the <b>ecological</b> <b>barriers</b> that previously prevented its westward invasion of the human environment...|$|R
