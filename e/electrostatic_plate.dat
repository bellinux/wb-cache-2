50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{electrostatic}} separators. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>plate</b> separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons {{to the plate and}} are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, {{one of the most important}} is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.|$|E

Two types of plates were compared, one photomechanical and the other an electrostatic. The photomechanical plate consisted of a light sensitive coating applied to an aluminum 1 base. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plate</b> consisted of a fused toner image on an aluminum base. The intent of this research was to determine the final resolution, not the forces and factors which effected it.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of a novel pivot for a seesaw, RF MEMS, {{double-pole}} double-throw (DPDT) switch, which has been developed to operate within mobile communication systems and devices. The pivot employs a unique ‘S’ structure at the nano scale, in the form of a, which helps to keep von-Mises stresses below 21 MPa. The pivot requires less pulling force than similar designs due to its flexibility which allows the beam and contacts a greater space of separation while the switch is off. This in turn results in improved contact isolation of greater than − 77 dB at 5 GHz. The RF MEMS switch is an improvement over the previously published paper (Al-Amin et al. in International symposium on microelectronics, vol 2013, no 1, pp 000831 – 000835, 2013. doi: 10. 1109 /ECS. 2014. 6892558), since the pulling force of the electrostatic plates can be generated with a voltage which is greatly reduced from 14 to 8 V using the same <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plate</b> area size. The switch is a progression from SPST and DPDT seesaw switching since it provides improved flexibility over the previously described devices. With the redesign of the pivot the switch attains a greater ‘air-gap’ between the contacts when open-circuited which therefore allows for improved isolation during the off-state...|$|E
40|$|In this work, photo-induced {{fragmentation}} {{study of}} molecules (O 2 and CH 3 I) using a velocity-map- imaging (VMI) spectrometer is performed. An indigenously built VMI spectrometer, {{housed in a}} non-magnetic stainless steel chamber under 10 − 8 mbar of vacuum was utilized. The fragmentation of molecules was induced by a 25 fs, 1 kHz Ti:Sapphire laser with a focal volume of 100 microns, leading to formation of ion fragments and electrons. The ions produced are directed by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plate</b> potentials towards a special detector {{that is capable of}} acquiring the time of impact and the position in a plane perpendicular to direction of propagation. From the combined information of the time-of- flight (TOF) and the position, the total kinetic energy of the ions shall be calculated. Preliminary information about the orbitals involved in the fragmentation of the excited state molecular oxygen ion is inferred from the angular distribution of the fragments acquired in the detector. A comparative study of fragmentation of methyl iodide under different laser pulse widths and average power is shown in this work. The capture of multiply charged ion fragments only at certain conditions and the variation in the radial distribution of the ions on the detector shed some light in the mechanisms involved in the birth of these ion fragments, either be autoionization or photo dissociation or Coulomb explosion...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to establish the effects of different milling techniques on the solvent-free electrostatic separation process for navy bean flour as well as to develop a model based on near infrared and fluorescence data to determine protein and starch content of the protein- and starch-enriched fractions using multivariate methods (i. e. partial least squares regression). Data fusion was used to combine the NIR and fluorescence spectra to try to achieve a model that had better predictability for protein and starch content. Protein content was measured using Kjeldahl digestion and starch content was measured using a dinitrosalicylic (DNS) acid array. The samples used in the NIR model are navy bean flour fractions from the electrostatic separation and the raw navy bean flour. There are 102 samples that are split in calibration (82 samples) and validation (20 samples) sets. The protein-enriched samples are collected from the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plate</b> while the starch-enriched fractions are collected {{from the bottom of the}} electrostatic separator. The acquisition of reproducible infrared and fluorescence data from powder samples was successfully achieved. The pin milled navy bean flour had an average particle size almost three times smaller than the regular milled navy bean flour which could have contributed to the a high protein content (40. 7 %) of the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled flour had a much higher protein extraction under optimum conditions but could only achieved a lesser protein content (32. 5 %) for the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled navy bean flour also seemed to have particles disaggregate in the triboelectric charging process. Multivariate methods and pre-treatment techniques were compared for the NIR spectra of the navy bean flour fractions from electrostatic separation to measure the protein and starch content. The best method used Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) pre-treatment with PLS regressions and had R 2 values of prediction of 0. 965 and 0. 912 for protein and starch content, respectively. The N-way partial least squares (NPLS) regression was still a good model seeing as the R 2 values of prediction for starch and protein content were 0. 946 and 0. 885, respectively. Two fluorophores were observed in navy bean flour: tryptophan and an unknown peak. It was observed that the starch model using the fluorescence dataset was highly correlated to the model’s predicted protein content (R 2 of 0. 978). The protein content model was better calibrated using the training set as well as providing a better prediction using the validation set for both NIR and fluorescence spectra. Data fusion was achieved by combining the NIR and unfolded fluorescence spectra of the navy bean flour fractions. The individual techniques had undergone pre-treatment separately and yielded the best model for determining protein content. Starch content was best determined using only the NIR spectra...|$|E

40|$|Charging of {{physical}} phase plates {{is a problem}} that has prevented their routine use in transmission electron microscopy of weak-phase objects. In theory, <b>electrostatic</b> phase <b>plates</b> are superior to thin-film phase plates since they do not attenuate the scattered electron beam and allow freely adjustable phase shifts. <b>Electrostatic</b> phase <b>plates</b> consist of multiple layers of conductive and insulating materials, and are thus more prone to charging than thin-film phase plates, which typically consist of only one single layer of amorphous material. We have addressed the origins of charging of Boersch phase plates and show how it can be reduced. In particular, we have performed simulations and experiments to analyze the influence of the insulating Si 3 N 4 layers and surface charges on electrostatic charging. To optimize the performance of <b>electrostatic</b> phase <b>plates,</b> it would be desirable to fabricate <b>electrostatic</b> phase <b>plates,</b> which (i) impart a homogeneous phase shift to the unscattered electrons, (ii) have a low cut-on frequency, (iii) expose as little material to the intense unscattered beam as possible, and (iv) can be additionally polished by a focused ion-beam instrument to eliminate carbon contamination accumulated during exposure to the unscattered electron beam (Walter et al., 2012, Ultramicroscopy, 116, 62 – 72). We propose a new type of <b>electrostatic</b> phase <b>plate</b> that meets the above requirements and would be superior to a Boersch phase plate. It consists of three free-standing coaxial rods converging in the center of an aperture (3 -fold coaxial phase plate).

50|$|Unlike atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy, {{which can only}} measure a single element at a time, ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 Pittcon Editors' Awards. An ICP-MS may use multiple scan modes, each one striking a different balance between speed and precision. Using the magnet alone to scan is slow, due to hysteresis, but is precise. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>plates</b> {{can be used in}} addition to the magnet to increase the speed, and this, combined with multiple collectors, can allow a scan of every element from Lithium 6 to Uranium Oxide 256 in {{less than a quarter of}} a second. For low detection limits, interfering species and high precision, the counting time can increase substantially. The rapid scanning, large dynamic range and large mass range is ideally suited to measuring multiple unknown concentrations and isotope ratios in samples that have had minimal preparation (an advantage over TIMS), for example seawater, urine, and digested whole rock samples. It also lends well to laser ablated rock samples, where the scanning rate is so quick that a real time plot of any number of isotopes is possible.This also allows easy spatial mapping of mineral grains.|$|R
