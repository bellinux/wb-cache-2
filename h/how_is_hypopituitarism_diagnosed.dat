40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} 1. 5 -year-old boy with {{refractory}} hyponatremia related to pituitary stalk transection, {{which is a}} rare cause of hyponatremia after traumatic brain injury. The patient was referred to our hospital with a hyponatremic convulsion 6 days after head trauma. The patient's laboratory findings were compatible with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The hyponatremic convulsion was treated with a hypertonic saline infusion and the SIADH was treated with fluid restriction, but serum levels of sodium did not increase. Acute post-traumatic <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> based on basal pituitary function tests and imaging. Hypophysis magnetic resonance imaging showed pituitary stalk transection.

40|$|Introduction Empty sella {{syndrome}} {{is a rather}} frequent neuroradiological finding {{in the general population}} and can <b>be</b> associated with <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Examinations reveal low pituitary hormone levels and lack of response to stimuli. Most patients suffer from central hypothyroidism as part of pituitary insufficiency. Primary hypothyreoidism is a rare finding in these patients. Case report We present 3 patients: one female and two male, suffering from complete hypopituitarism, as part of the empty sella syndrome diagnosed due to low concentrations of all pituitary hormones, elevated TSH and low thyroid hormones. TRH, LHRH, ACTH and ITT tests, as well as IGF 1 have confirmed hypopituitarism and primary hypothyroidism. CT and NMR in all three patients showed empty sella without a tumor in it. The diagnosis of primary hypothyrodism in the first patient <b>was</b> made before <b>hypopituitarism</b> has taken place, or {{at the same time in}} the second patient, whereas in the third patient it was diagnosed twenty years later. In two patients anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibody levels were high, and in the third patient they were not elevated. It can be assumed that the etiology of primary hypothyrodism in all three patients was of autoimmune origin, which caused thyroid hypofunction. High level of TSH in all three patients and especially in the patient whose <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> twenty years later, showed presence of thyrotrophic cells in the pituitary. Evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis was carried out during the complete substitution therapy of <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Conclusion <b>Diagnosing</b> primary hypothyrodism associated with hypopituitarism helps improving the knowledge on empty sella syndrome and points to different clinical syndromes characterized by lack of mixoedema, although approach to therapy is the same for both primary and central hypothyroidism...|$|R

40|$|Hypopituitarism after {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) {{is considered to be}} a prevalent condition. However, prevalence rates differ considerably among reported studies, due to differences in definitions, endocrine assessments of hypopituitarism, and confounding factors, such as timing of evaluation and the severity of the trauma. Aim To evaluate the prevalence of hypopituitarism in a large cohort of TBI patients after long-term follow-up using a standardized endocrine evaluation. Study design Cross-sectional study. We included 112 patients with TBI, hospitalized for at least 3 days and duration of follow-up > 1 year after TBI from five (neurosurgical) referral centers. Evaluation of pituitary function included fasting morning hormone measurements and insulin tolerance test (n= 90) or, when contraindicated, ACTH stimulation and/or CRH stimulation tests and a GH releasing hormone-arginine test (n= 22). Clinical evaluation included quality of life questionnaires. We studied 112 patients (75 males), with median age 48 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 26. 7 ± 4. 8  kg/m(2). Mean duration of hospitalization was 11 (3 - 105), and 33 % of the patients had a severe trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale < 9) after TBI. The mean duration of follow-up was 4 (1 - 12) years. <b>Hypopituitarism</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 5. 4 % (6 / 112) of patients: severe GH deficiency (n= 3), hypogonadism (n= 1), adrenal insufficiency (n= 2). Patients diagnosed with pituitary insufficiency had significantly higher BMI (P= 0. 002). In this study, the prevalence of hypopituitarism during long-term follow-up after TBI was low.

40|$|Background: Congenital <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> an {{uncommon}} cause of hypophyseal insufficiency It is less common than growth hormone deficiency {{which has an}} incidence of 1 : 4. 000 to 1 : 8. 000 Uve newborns. Early diagnosis ofthis condition is important to prevent impairment of cognitive function, poor growth and alterations in metabolic profile in these patients. Aim: To report 23 patients <b>diagnosed</b> with congenital <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Material and methods: Retrospective review of clinical records of 23 patients (12 males) with congenital <b>hypopituitarism,</b> <b>diagnosed</b> during a 21 years period. In a group of 16 patients a molecular study was performed searching for mutations in HESX 1, PROP- 1 or POUF- 1. Results: Short stature was the most frequent sign at the first evaluation, followed by neonatal hypoglycemia and presence of nistagmus, strabismus, atrophic optic nerve or malformations in the middle Une showed in CNS imaging, suggesting septo-optic-dysplasia. All male patients diagnosed during neonatal period, exhibited micropenis. CNS images showed isolated hypophyseal hypoplasia or associated to an ectopic neurohypophysis in most patients. No patient in the subgroup subjected to molecular analysis had any of the mutations in the searched genes.

40|$|Puumala {{hantavirus}} (PUUV) infection causes nephropathia epidemica (NE), {{a relatively}} mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Hypophyseal haemorrhage and <b>hypopituitarism</b> have <b>been</b> described in case reports on patients with acute NE. Chronic <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{months or years}} after the acute illness has also been reported, without any signs of a haemorrhagic aetiology. The mechanisms leading to the late-onset hormonal defects remain unknown. Here, we present a case of NE-associated autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and hypopituitarism presumably due to autoimmune hypophysitis. Thyroid peroxidase antibody seroconversion occurred between 6 and 12  months, and ovarian as well as glutamate decarboxylase antibodies were found 18  months after acute NE. Brain MRI revealed an atrophic adenohypophysis with a heterogeneous, low signal intensity compatible with a sequela of hypophysitis. The patient developed central (or mixed central and peripheral) hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and diabetes insipidus, all requiring hormonal replacement therapy. This case report suggests that late-onset hormonal defects after PUUV infection may develop by an autoimmune mechanism. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by prospective studies with sufficient numbers of patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The typical {{pattern of}} thyroid {{function}} tests (TFTs) associated with hypopituitarism consists of subnormal free T 4 (fT 4) or total T 4 and normal or marginally elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A previous study calculated an incidence of hypopituitarism of 3. 2 cases/ 100, 000 /year by following up abnormal TFTs. The {{aim of this}} study was to verify the incidence of unsuspected <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by reflective testing on such samples in a Scottish population. METHODS: Prospective audit of TFT results over 15 months. Individuals with suitable results (fT 4 &# 60; 9 pmol/L, TSH &# 60; 10 mU/L) were identified by the laboratory information system at the Biochemistry Department, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, serving a population of 200, 000. fT 4 (repeat analysis following assay recalibration), total T 3, testosterone (males), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin and cortisol were analysed on appropriate samples. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven suitable results from 266 adult individuals were identified from a total of 73, 650 TFT results, leading to the diagnosis of 10 new cases (age range 28 - 90 years) of hypopituitarism (approximately 4 cases/ 100, 000 /year). Nine patients now attend endocrine clinics. Pituitary imaging was abnormal in five cases (2 large pituitary tumours, one macroadenoma, 2 empty sellae), normal in three cases and two patients were not scanned. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of cases of unsuspected <b>hypopituitarism</b> can <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by reflective testing on appropriate samples. fT 4 should be an integral part of frontline TFTs as TSH alone cannot assist in the identification of possible <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Laboratories <b>are</b> in an excellent position to assist in early identification of hypopituitarism, which may lead to improved outcomes in such patients...|$|R

40|$|A current {{research}} topic, that is developed in this presentation, {{is the study}} of disturbance of circadian hormonal cycles and the secretion of melatonin.

Melatonin secretion and hormonal rhythms are severely disturbed in acute TBI patients (Seifman & al. Front Neurol 2014). Light is the primary variable that entrains the main circadian clock in the central nervous system. The retinohypothalamic tract generates an overt 24 -hour rhythm. These coordinated outputs are conveyed through {{to the rest of the}} body via neuroendocrine (ie melatonin and ACTH-cortisol secretion), autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways) and behavioral pathways (feeding, locomotor activity, etc).

40|$|Russell's vipers (Daboia russelii and D. siamensis) inhabit 10 South and South East Asian countries. People envenomed {{by these}} snakes suffer coagulopathy, bleeding, shock, neurotoxicity, acute kidney injury and local tissue damage leading to severe {{morbidity}} and mortality. An unusual complication of Russell's viper bite envenoming in Burma (D. siamensis) and southern India (D. russelii) <b>is</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> but until {{now it has}} not been reported elsewhere. Here, we describe the first case of hypopituitarism following Russell's viper bite in Sri Lanka, review the literature on this subject and make recommendations for endocrine investigation and management. A 49 -year-old man was bitten and seriously envenomed by D. russelii in 2005. He was treated with antivenom but although he recovered from the acute effects he remained feeling unwell. Hypopituitarism, with deficiencies of gonadal, steroid and thyroid axes, was diagnosed 3 years later. He showed marked improvement after replacement of anterior pituitary hormones. We attribute his hypopituitarism to D. russelii envenoming. Russell's viper bite is known to cause acute and chronic hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, perhaps through deposition of fibrin microthrombi and haemorrhage in the pituitary gland resulting from the action of venom procoagulant enzymes and haemorrhagins. Forty nine cases of hypopituitarism following Russell's viper bite have been described in the English language literature. Patients with acute hypopituitarism may present with hypoglycaemia and hypotension during the acute phase of envenoming. Those with chronic hypopituitarism seem to have recovered from envenoming but present later with features of hypopituitarism. Over 85 % of these patients had suffered acute kidney injury immediately after the bite. Steroid replacement in acute <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> life saving. All 11 patients with chronic hypopituitarism in whom the outcome of treatment was reported, showed marked improvement with hormone replacement.

40|$|International audienceDEFINITION: Congenital <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, including somatotroph, thyrotroph, lactotroph, corticotroph or gonadotroph deficiencies, due to mutations of pituitary transcription factors involved in pituitary ontogenesis. INCIDENCE: Congenital <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> rare {{compared with the}} high incidence of hypopituitarism induced by pituitary adenomas, transsphenoidal surgery or radiotherapy. The incidence of congenital <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be between 1 : 3000 and 1 : 4000 births. CLINICAL SIGNS: Clinical presentation is variable, depending on the type and severity of deficiencies and on the age at diagnosis. If untreated, main symptoms include short stature, cognitive alterations or delayed puberty. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) must be suspected when evident causes of hypopituitarism (sellar tumor, postsurgical or radioinduced <b>hypopituitarism</b> [...] .) have <b>been</b> ruled out. Clinical, biological and radiological work-up is very important to better determine which transcription factor should be screened. Confirmation is provided by direct sequencing of the transcription factor genes. AETIOLOGY: Congenital <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>is</b> due to mutations of several genes encoding pituitary transcription factors. Phenotype varies with the factor involved: PROP 1 (somatolactotroph, thyrotroph, gonadotroph and sometimes corticotroph deficiencies; pituitary hyper and hypoplasia), POU 1 F 1 (somatolactotroph and thyrotroph deficiencies, pituitary hypoplasia), HESX 1 (variable pituitary deficiencies, septo-optic dysplasia), and less frequently LHX 3 (somatolactotroph, thyrotroph and gonadotroph deficiencies, limited head and neck rotation) and LHX 4 (variable pituitary deficiencies, ectopic neurohypophysis, cerebral abnormalities). MANAGEMENT: An appropriate replacement of hormone deficiencies is required. Strict follow-up is necessary because patients develop new deficiencies (for example late onset corticotroph deficiency in patients with PROP 1 mutations). GENETIC COUNSELLING: Type of transmission varies with the factor and the mutation involved (recessive transmission for PROP 1 and LHX 3, dominant for LHX 4, autosomal or recessive for POU 1 F 1 and HESX 1). PROGNOSIS: It is equivalent to patients without pituitary deficiencies if treatment is started immediately when diagnosis is confirmed, and if a specialized follow-up is performed...|$|R
