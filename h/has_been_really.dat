I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E

'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year or two ago, down the street from where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> sad to witness."

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed by Simon Cowell to a £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour.

The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record. [...] "The stuff I've heard <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> catchy and everyone loves the guys, so it's just about capturing that in the music, which I think is what they're going to be doing." [...] Sonny Takhar, {{the chief executive officer of}} Syco Records, in an August 2011 issue of Music Week, described the recording process as a [...] "very intensive period" [...] for the group. Takhar added the resulting album was one of the best pop records made by Syco Records in the past few years, and that he was confident it would be successful. In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America. Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign with One Direction. [...] "Other artists in that category had gotten a little older," [...] he said.

It is from the place – as one of Australia's great musical dames – that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. [...] "I've struggled with the phantasmal aspect that {{has been a part of}} what we do" [...] she says. [...] "The fact that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well.

[...] In fact, the show has explained via their Facebook page that the cast and crew have sometimes had all-nighters in order to wrap up episodes in time for their broadcast dates. Bajo explained, [...] "It's such a team effort [...] it would be unprofessional and incorrect to take too much of that kudos... I think we're our own worst and best critics... we know if something worked or if it didn't so we're always trying new things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Mussenden {{was hired}} as casting director, and held casting calls {{throughout}} the United States including San Antonio, Texas, Miami, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Casting calls began on March 16, 1996 and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose 10-year-old Becky Lee Meza of Harlingen to portray young Selena, her acting debut. [...] Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena {{and that it would}} be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition. Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was [...] "among the strongest". Lopez had previously worked with Nava in My Family (1995). Screen testing was described as [...] "grueling" [...] and required [...] "nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script." [...] After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play a Texan of Mexican descent. The Mexican media disapproved the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: [...] "I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus [...] everyone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was [...] "a little hurtful", and felt the protesters [...] "should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star." [...] The announcement was described as the [...] "role of a lifetime." [...] from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million, which made Lopez the highest paid Hispanic actress in history. Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "nothing could have prepared [...] for the hype attached to her million-dollar salary." ...|$|E
