5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, {{so as to be}} indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E

25|$|The Ballad of Yoel Moshe Salomon was {{recorded}} in 1970 by Arik Einstein, a popular artist in the then emerging Israeli rock music genre. It was the final track on Einstein’s and composer Shalom Hanoch’s influential album Shablul ‘Snail’, and was featured in an accompanying film by the same name. The ballad was also included on Arik Einstein’s album Good Old Israel in 1973. A measure of the ballad’s popularity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> its version of events {{has become part of}} the public memory of the foundation of Petah Tikva.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared {{as a result}} of our linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.|$|E
25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning {{to the events of}} Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{questions}} after Obama's speech was what effect (if any) the speech would have on voters {{in terms of their}} overall opinion of Obama and their willingness to vote for him in the remaining Democratic primaries and in the general election.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Chartres Cathedral <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> architectural structure has been adapted {{to meet the}} needs of stained glass. The use of a three-part elevation with external buttressing allowed for far larger windows than earlier designs, particularly at the clerestory level. Most cathedrals of the period had a mixture of windows containing plain or grisaille glass and windows containing dense stained glass panels, with the result that the brightness of the former tended to diminish the impact and legibility of the latter. At Chartres, nearly all of the 176 windows were filled with equally dense stained glass, creating a relatively dark but richly coloured interior in which the light filtering through the myriad narrative and symbolic windows was the main source of illumination.|$|E
25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved is {{the question}} of how many artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the character of individual artists can be identified in this work of art. There is agreement that at least the basic design of the frieze was the work of a single artist. In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; nothing had been left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their distinctive character rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} of David Cameron {{as leader of}} the Conservatives focused questions on Campbell's age: old enough to be Cameron's father, was he too old for modern politics or did his seniority give him an advantage, a welcome contrast to Cameron?

500|$|After the Second World War, {{a stained}} glass window {{designed}} by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors {{was placed in the}} Kingsley Hall community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by [...] streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, completed in 1951 A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating [...] {{before the turn of the}} 20th century [...] had become [...] accepted mainstream doctrine little more than [...] a decade after his death.|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi {{retained}} {{emotional and}} political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, {{large amounts of}} stage music including at least four operas. The ballet Tirsi e Clori survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, {{but the rest of}} the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: [...] "Without these links... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.|$|E
500|$|According to some writers, Sex {{also helped}} Madonna {{make a name}} in the porn industry, and earned her the title of S's first {{cultural}} ambassador and was praised for recreating [...] "porn-chic". Humberto Quiroga Lavié pointed {{out that it was}} the fact that Sex was considered pornographic that helped it become a bestseller. Steve Bachmann, on his book Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity pointed out that [...] "perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise". McNair wrote in his book that [...] "Sex brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture". London art critic Sarah Kent wrote in Time Out magazine that the timing of Sex was [...] "impeccable. Obsessions about the human body was in vogue, with Madonna's book as well as artist Andres Serrano's [...] "cumming shots" [...] and Jeff Koons' The Jeff Koons Handbook, the latter portrayed fairytale pictures of the artist having sex with his pornographic actor wife, Cicciolina.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive factors or {{learning}} factors, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which a person’s individual capabilities can influence their academic {{or learning}} performance. These factors include cognitive functions like attention, memory, and reasoning.

500|$|Inspiration {{to work on}} Her Story {{stemmed from}} Barlow's {{disappointment}} of other detectives games: he felt that L.A. Noire (2011) never allowed him to feel like [...] "the awesome detective who was having to read things and follow up threads of investigation", and he called the Ace Attorney series (2001–present) [...] "rigidity". When Barlow began development on Her Story, he added more typical game aspects, but the game mechanics became more minimalist as development progressed. The initial plan for the game was for players to work towards a definitive resolution, ultimately solving the crime. However, when Barlow tested the concept on pre-existing interview transcripts of convicted murderer Christopher Porco, he began to discover themes surfacing within the interviews, particularly relating {{to the concept of}} money, which was ultimately a large factor in Porco's trial. He took this concept of recurring themes and threads, and decided to [...] "move beyond the clearly scripted stuff" [...] when developing Her Story. Barlow felt that the story's appeal was the ambiguity of the investigation, comparing Her Story to the podcast Serial (2014–present), which he listened to late in development. He found that the attraction of Serial was the lack of a definitive solution, noting that [...] "people lean towards certain interpretations ... what makes it interesting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> it lives on in your imagination".|$|E
500|$|Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> Kahn {{deliberately}} introduced elements {{into some}} of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. [...] Kahn himself spoke of [...] "wrapping ruins around buildings", although {{in the context of}} another project. In his essay [...] "Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome," [...] Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, [...] "And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't even let it become a building; he wants it to remain a ruin. [...] The walls don't connect at the top. [...] They remain like a hollow shell". [...] Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects. In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, [...] "This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested." [...] In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library at Phillips Exeter by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that the adjustment of psychiatric patients is adversely affected by family criticism. The present study elaborated on this theme by focusing on fifty schizophrenic patients who were formally interviewed, using a standard visual analog scale format, about their perception of family criticism. Two important conceptual distinctions <b>were</b> proposed. <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which criticism <b>was</b> perceived as "constructive" or "destructive", and <b>the</b> second <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> criticism <b>was</b> perceived to be "person directed" or "behavior directed". Regression analyses were performed {{in order to determine}} the predictive utility of the various dimensions of criticism on patient outcomes. The results indicate first, that criticism is not always perceived as negative and secondly, patients who perceived high levels of negative criticism (destructive, person directed) had relatively poor outcomes. Those who perceived high levels of positive criticism (constructive, behavior directed) had more positive outcomes. The results therefore indicate that criticism is multidimensional. This awareness of different meanings of criticism may lead to early identification of adjustment difficulties and subsequent interventions to prevent them...|$|R
