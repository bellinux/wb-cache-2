2500|$|... "But," [...] David Clowney writes, [...] "freedom is frightening, and it {{is easier}} to run from it into the safety of roles and realities that are defined by society, or even by your own past. To be free is to be thrown into {{existence}} with no [...] "human nature" [...] as an essence to define you, and no definition of the reality into which you are thrown, either. To accept this freedom is to live [...] "authentically"; but most of us run from authenticity. In the most ordinary affairs of daily life, we <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of authentic choice, and the temptation of comfortable inauthenticity. All of Roquentin's experiences are related to these themes from Sartre's philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nursing historians <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of {{determining}} whether care {{provided to the}} sick or injured in antiquity was nursing care.

Around 600 BC in India, it is recorded in Sushruta Samhita, Book 3, Chapter V about the role of nurse as [...] "the different parts or members of the body as mentioned before including the skin, cannot be correctly described by one who is not well versed in anatomy. Hence, any one desirous of acquiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy should prepare a dead body and carefully, observe, by dissecting it, and examine its different parts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slavery splits {{a person}} into a {{fragmented}} figure. The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a [...] "self {{that is no}} self." [...] To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the [...] "self" [...] becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake their selves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The 'self' {{is located in a}} word, defined by others. The power lies in the audience, or more precisely, in the word – once the word changes, so does the identity. All of the characters in Beloved <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of an unmade self, composed of their [...] "rememories" [...] and defined by perceptions and language. The barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an [...] "uncomplicated past" [...] and the fear that remembering will lead them to [...] "a place they couldn't get back from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Otolith and {{vertebrae}} {{studies have}} proved useful {{in determining the}} age and thus growth patterns of the species, with other methods including scale and fin ray sectioning having lesser value. The species otoliths {{have been the subject}} of detailed X-ray diffraction studies, which have indicated biomineralisation of the otoliths occurs predominantly in the aragonite phase. Females grow faster than males, reaching 266.5mm after their first year of life, 364.4 after their second, 370.9mm after the third and 546.7 after their fifth. A female of 676.6mm was 9 years old. Males reach 252.4mm in their first year, 336.2mm in their second, 363.8 in the third and 510.3 in their fifth. A male of 554mm was eight years old. The oldest studied individual was a 934-mm individual of unspecified sex, which was 17 years old. The larvae are pelagic and are found over continental shelf waters and occasionally in the oceanic zone proximal to the continental slope. They are present all year round in the Gulf of Mexico, with a peak in abundance during the summer months due to spawning peaks. While the young juveniles live in the exposed pelagic environment, they use a behaviour called 'piloting' to [...] swim in very close proximity to both larger animals and floating objects, such as sargassum mats, buoys and even boats. By the time juveniles make their way to shore, they may have been dispersed large distances from their initial spawning grounds and may <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of migration to warmer climates during winter if they are to survive as outlined previously. Juveniles use estuaries and seagrass beds as their main nursery habitats.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 1525 {{troops of}} the Swabian League based at Erbach moved towards Dellmensingen in order to loot the village. Even though the {{commanding}} officer of this detachment, Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, had planned to cross the Danube with all his forces, he did not manage to have his artillery traverse the river and due to the boggy terrain the cavalry could not be utilised either. Parts of the Baltringer Haufen, however, had been deployed at Dellmensingen. During the ensuing battle 50 soldiers of the Swabian League lost their lives. Consequently, the attacking troops retreated over the river Danube. Further skirmishes took place near Achstetten, Oberstadion and Zwiefalten during which several villages, after having been looted, were set ablaze by {{troops of the}} Swabian League. Following these first unsuccessful attempts to subdue the Baltringer Haufen, Georg Truchsess von Waldburg then turned to <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of the seemingly more threatening [...] peasant army that had formed near Leipheim. During the ensuing battle, the Leipheimer Haufen was utterly defeated on 4 April 1525; their leaders, Hans Jakob Wehe and seven others, were executed by being beheaded the next day. On 10 April 1525 the Swabian League's army {{under the command of}} Georg Truchsess von Waldburg departed Leipheim in order to return to Upper Swabia. The next day the army encountered a band of peasants near Laupheim who decided to make a stand on the hill where the local church stood. During the ensuing battle, the army of the Swabian League killed 150 farmers, scattering the survivors into the surrounding forests. This enabled Georg Truchsess von Waldburg to proceed to Baltringen where he arrived on 12 April 1525, accompanied by a force of 400 men. The remaining forces of the Baltringer Haufen between Biberach and Ulm capitulated unconditionally. In spite of orders by the Swabian League, the village of Baltringen was not burnt to the ground.|$|E
