The school's {{official}} colors are recognized as Cardinal Red and Forest <b>Green,</b> with <b>cardinal</b> being the primary color. Originally, Glen Cove High's sports teams were the Glen Cove Knights, but attendance at events was floundering in the 1970s. In an attempt to attract more fans and garner more attention, the nickname [...] "Big Red" [...] began to be used, {{thanks in large part}} to the red jerseys of the athletes. Today, both entities have been combined, and GC's team names are the Big Red with their mascot a medieval knight (Exp. Cornell Big Red). Additionally, the 'Covers' has always been a popular nickname used by many alumni as well.|$|R

The Cardinals had already traded for Fingers, who had played for the San Diego Padres, but after acquiring him the team acquired Sutter from the Chicago Cubs and thus added Fingers to the trade with the Brewers.|$|R

He was {{the head}} coach for the National Football League's Chicago Cardinals from 1925 to 1926.

In two seasons, he compiled a record of 16-10-2. Prior to his coaching career, he played in the early NFL for the <b>Cardinals,</b> <b>Green</b> Bay Packers and Milwaukee Badgers.|$|R
60|$|When I {{was in my}} fifteenth year, {{before any}} changes had taken place and the great {{outbreaks}} of cholera and yellow fever were yet to come, I spent four or five weeks in the city, greatly enjoying the novel scenes and new life. After about ten or twelve days I began to feel tired and languid, and this feeling grew on me day by day until it became almost painful to exert myself to visit even my most favoured haunts--the great South Market, where cage-birds were {{to be seen in}} hundreds, <b>green</b> paroquets, <b>cardinals,</b> and bishop-birds predominating; or to the river front, where I spent much time fishing for little silvery king-fishes from the rocks; or further away to the quintas and gardens on the cliff, where I first feasted my eyes on the sight of orange groves laden with golden fruit amidst the vivid green polished foliage, and old olive trees with black egg-shaped fruit showing among the grey leaves.|$|R
50|$|In the Western {{rites of}} the Catholic Church, {{as a matter}} of {{customary}} terminology, the term cincture is most often applied to a long, rope-like cord with tassled or knotted ends, tied around the waist outside the alb. The colour may be white, or may vary according to the colour of the liturgical season. A Catholic bishop's cincture is made of intertwining gold and <b>green</b> threads, a <b>cardinal's</b> has red and gold, and the pope's with white and gold. When the cincture is tied in the front and the ends draped on either side, it is called a Roman Knot.|$|R
50|$|The 1936 Chicago Bears {{season was}} their 17th regular season {{completed}} in the National Football League. The club posted a 9-3-0 record and finished in {{second place in the}} Western Division behind the Green Bay Packers. After week 10, the Bears were tied with the Packers in first place with identical 9-1 records, having split their season series. However, the club swooned {{at the end of the}} year, losing their last two games on the road to Detroit and the <b>Cardinals.</b> <b>Green</b> Bay went on to easily defeat the Boston Redskins and win the NFL title.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{statements}} above can be made clearer by picturing the day arc (i.e., the path along which the Sun appears to move across the sky). The pictures show this for every hour on equinox day. In addition, some 'ghost' suns are also indicated below the horizon, up to 18° below it; the Sun in such areas still causes twilight.

5000|$|Many of {{the tracks}} on Surprise were also {{recorded}} by other artists, including the jazz tinged [...] "Mama Do" [...] (recorded as [...] "Papa Do" [...] by Barry <b>Green</b> and also <b>Cardinal</b> Point), [...] "Ivory Tower" [...] (released as a single by Caroline Hall), [...] "Crossword Puzzle" [...] (recorded and released as a single by Dana), plus [...] "Sleeping Blue Nights" [...] recorded by Zig-Zag.

50|$|In league {{meetings}} {{prior to}} the 1933 season, three new teams, the Pirates, the Cincinnati Reds and the Eagles, were admitted to the NFL. Ten teams were then in the NFL and, at George Preston Marshall's urging, with Halas' support, NFL was reorganized into an Eastern Division and a Western Division. In the Eastern Division were the Philadelphia Eagles, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Redskins, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the Western Division were the Chicago Bears, Portsmouth Spartans, Chicago <b>Cardinals,</b> <b>Green</b> Bay Packers, and the Cincinnati Reds. Furthermore, the two owners convinced the league to have the two division winners meet in a NFL Championship Game.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, Green {{took the}} head {{coaching}} position at Stanford University, inheriting {{a team that}} had graduated 17 of its 21 starters from 1988. <b>Green</b> led the <b>Cardinal</b> from 1989 to 1991. During that time, his teams finished with an overall record of 16-18, a [...]471 winning percentage, going 3-0 in the Big Game against the California Golden Bears. In 1990, his Stanford team defeated top-ranked Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. His tenure culminated with an 8-3 record (Stanford's best since 1986). A loss to Washington in the opening {{game of the season}} was the deciding factor for the Pac-10 championship. The Cardinal made an appearance in the 1991 Aloha Bowl, where his team lost to Georgia Tech on a last-minute touchdown.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 he was {{packaged}} {{in a trade}} to the Green Bay Packers involving John Hadl.'''''' His Packers career {{got off to a}} rocky start. Dickey suffered a broken leg in 1977, causing him to miss two full calendar years. But by 1980 he was back as the starter. Dickey led the Packers to the 16-team playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season. The Packers won the opening round after Dickey went 19 of 26 (73%) for 286 yards with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions in a 41-16 triumph over the St. Louis <b>Cardinals.</b> <b>Green</b> Bay was eliminated the following week by the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round after Dickey went 24 of 37 for 274 yards with 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions as the team fell 37-26.|$|R
50|$|Green {{began his}} third {{season as the}} backup tight end behind Antonio Gates. Although he was named the backup ahead of John Phillips, Green's role with the Chargers changed under new {{offensive}} coordinator Frank Reich, requiring him to block {{the majority of the}} time as Gates was the primary pass catching tight end. In the Charger's season opening loss to the Arizona <b>Cardinals,</b> <b>Green</b> caught two passes for 24-yards. He earned his first start of the season the following game against the Seattle Seahawks but finished the loss without a catch. During Week 3, Green caught a season-high four passes for 68 receiving yards during a 28-10 victory at the Buffalo Bills. Green ended the season with 19 receptions on 23 targets for 226 yards and averaged 11.6 yards per catch while also starting four games and appearing in 14.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, former Northwestern {{head coach}} Dennis Green left the 49ers, {{where he was}} serving as wide {{receivers}} coach, and took the head coaching position at Stanford, inheriting a team that had graduated 17 of its 21 starters from 1988. <b>Green</b> led the <b>Cardinal</b> from 1989 to 1991.

50|$|Green {{was drafted}} by the Cardinals in the fourth round of the 1979 NFL Draft. He starred as a rookie {{returning}} kicks, including a 106-yard return for a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys, tying an NFL record. Green also played well at cornerback. In 1981, he stepped in as wide receiver part-time and managed to gain 708 yards on merely 33 catches - nearly 21.5 yards per catch. The following season, Green fully transitioned to wide receiver and performed well in the strike-shortened season. Green truly shined during the next several seasons, particularly in 1984 when his 1,555 receiving yards were then the third highest in a season (through the 2005 season, this has since dropped to eighteenth). <b>Green</b> led the <b>Cardinals</b> in receiving in 1983, 1984 and 1988 (during those intervening years, veterans Pat Tilley and J. T. Smith split time leading the team in receiving).|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, {{we went to}} the Barberini Library, {{passing through}} the vast hall, which {{occupies}} {{the central part of the}} palace. It is the most splendid domestic hall I have seen, eighty feet in length at least, and of proportionate breadth and height; and the vaulted ceiling is entirely covered, to its utmost edge and remotest corners, with a brilliant painting in fresco, looking like a whole heaven of angelic people descending towards the floor. The effect is indescribably gorgeous. On one side stands a Baldacchino, or canopy of state, draped with scarlet cloth, and fringed with gold embroidery; the scarlet indicating that the palace is inhabited by a <b>cardinal.</b> <b>Green</b> would be appropriate to a prince. In point of fact, the Palazzo Barberini is inhabited by a cardinal, a prince, and a duke, all belonging to the Barberini family, and each having his separate portion of the palace, while their servants have a common territory and meeting-ground in this noble hall.|$|R

6000|$|Not {{long ago}} he was {{overgrown}} with fat, obscured to view, and a burthen to himself. Captains visiting the island advised him to walk; and though it broke the habits of a life and the traditions of his rank, he practised the remedy with benefit. His corpulence is now portable; you would call him lusty rather than fat; but his gait is still dull, stumbling, and elephantine. He neither stops nor hastens, but goes about his business with an implacable deliberation. We could never see him and not be struck with his extraordinary natural means for the theatre: a beaked profile like Dante's in the mask, a mane of long black hair, the eye brilliant, imperious, and inquiring: for certain parts, and to one who could have used it, the face was a fortune. His voice matched it well, being shrill, powerful, and uncanny, with a note like a sea-bird's. Where there are no fashions, none to set them, few to follow them if they were set, and none to criticise, he dresses--as Sir Charles Grandison lived--"to his own heart." [...] Now he wears a woman's frock, now a naval uniform; now (and more usually) figures in a masquerade costume of his own design: trousers and a singular jacket with shirt tails, the cut and fit wonderful for island workmanship, the material always handsome, sometimes <b>green</b> velvet, sometimes <b>cardinal</b> red silk. This masquerade becomes him admirably. In the woman's frock he looks ominous and weird beyond belief. I see him now come pacing towards me in the cruel sun, solitary, a figure out of Hoffmann.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a patron}} entered the front doors, {{he would have}} {{found himself in a}} lobby with two {{stairwells}} leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. [...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas {{on the floor in front}} of the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of <b>cardinal,</b> <b>green,</b> and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing." [...] Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch.|$|R
