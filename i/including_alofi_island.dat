50|$|Wallis Island {{is located}} 240 km {{northeast}} of Futuna and <b>Alofi</b> <b>islands</b> which form the Hoorn archipelago. Together with some 15 smaller islands surrounding it, on its huge barrier reef, it forms the Wallis archipelago. Wallis has a fertile volcanic soil and sufficient rainfall to allow subsistence farming.|$|R
5000|$|Niue High School Oval is a multi-use stadium of Niue High School in Alofi, Niue, {{currently}} used mostly for association football matches. The stadium holds 1,000 people. [...] Its tenants <b>include</b> <b>Alofi</b> F.C. and Talava F.C..|$|R
50|$|Its {{land area}} is 142.42 km2 with a {{population}} of about 12,000. Mata-Utu is the capital and biggest city. The territory is made up of three main volcanic tropical islands along with a number of tiny islets, and is split into two island groups that lie about 260 km apart, namely the Wallis Islands (Uvea) in the northeast, and the Hoorn Islands (also known as the Futuna Islands) in the southwest, including Futuna Island proper and the mostly uninhabited <b>Alofi</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alo {{encompasses}} the eastern two thirds (53 km2 out of 83 km2) of Futuna Island, {{and all of}} the mostly uninhabited <b>Alofi</b> <b>Island</b> (32 km2, population 2), 2 km to the southeast of Futuna Island. The total area of the chiefdom is 85 km2, and total population is 2,993 spread among nine villages, as of the July 22, 2003 census. The capital is the village of Mala'e (population 238). The largest village is Ono (population 738). The current Tuigaifo, or King, of the Kingdom of Alo is Petelo Sea, whose coronation took place on January 17, 2014.|$|R
50|$|Two kings, elected {{from the}} local nobility every few years, rule the {{population}} in conjunction with French authorities. They are the king of Sigave, the western province, and the king of Alo, the eastern province <b>including</b> <b>Alofi.</b> Except for Poi all villages are along the southwest coast, and they are from west to east: Toloke, Fiua, Vaisei, Nuku, and Leava (capital with the wharf) in Sigave, and Taoa, Malae, Ono, Kolia and Vele (at the airstrip) in Alo.|$|R
50|$|It is {{virtually}} uninhabited (population 2 as of census of 2003 {{in the village}} of Alofitai in the west), and under the chief of Alo on Futuna, but in pre-European times it was as densely populated as Futuna, which would have had a population of almost 1900. Former villages were Sologa (north), Sa'avaka (southeast), Alofitai (west), and Mua (northwest). Some maps also show a village of Gaino in the north. <b>Alofi</b> <b>island</b> is only 2 km southeast of Futuna. Futunians who have plantations on Alofi go there at least every Saturday to tend their gardens. A popular crop is tobacco, and they take enough leaves with {{them to be able to}} smoke for the rest of the week.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alofi</b> is an <b>island</b> in the Pacific Ocean {{belonging}} to the French overseas collectivity (collectivité d'outre-mer, or COM) of Wallis and Futuna.|$|R
50|$|Early on December 28, RSMC Nadi {{reported}} that Tropical Disturbance 02F had developed within {{an area of}} moderate windshear, about 140 km (90 mi) to the southeast of <b>Alofi</b> on the <b>island</b> of Niue. During the next day, the disturbance moved towards the east, before it developed into a tropical depression during the next day.|$|R
50|$|Futuna and Alofi {{were put}} on the European maps by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire during their famous circumnavigation of the globe with the ship the Eendracht in 1616. After having come from Niuafoou, they {{suddenly}} changed their course from west to northwest and so stumbled on this island pair. They called it Hoorn Eylanden, after the city of Hoorn, Schouten's birthplace, which became Horne in both French and English. Wise from their earlier experiences, they started with {{a show of force}} to the natives who approached them, which resulted in a peaceful barter with coconuts, yams and hogs from one side and iron nails, beads and knives from the other. They found a beautiful bay, a natural harbour along the southwest coast of Futuna, which they called after the ship the Eendrachts baai (Unity bay). This must be the Anse de Sigave near Leava of today. They went ashore on to get water and met the king, who told his subjects that their guests were not to be disturbed by petty thieving. In this amiable way the Dutch were able to replenish their stocks. A few days later the king of the other <b>island,</b> <b>Alofi,</b> came to visit with 300 men. The two kings were extremely courteous to each other, and a big feast was prepared. A kava ceremony and umu were organised. Schouten and LeMaire were probably the first Europeans ever to witness these, and the description they gave still rings familiar tones nowadays.|$|R
