5|$|The American effort {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} soon outstripped the British as the American authorities {{were reluctant to}} share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access {{to all of the}} information available. They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
30|$|If we analyse {{the density}} of the three networks, we note that the {{cooperation}} network is relatively dense (0.143) and yet the business relations, especially the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> confidential <b>information</b> networks, have a low density. Network density measures the proportion of existing relationships over the total possible relationships; in this regard, in the PCiTAL greater cooperation links are produced between enterprises than business relations or <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b>|$|R

5|$|In an upper-class {{town square}} in Prague, Lara meets a Czech {{journalist}} named Thomas Luddick, who fills her in on Eckhardt, {{revealed to be}} an immortal black alchemist who leads a mysterious local organization called the Cabal, and whom Luddick believes is the Monstrum. Lara also encounters a captive Bouchard near the crime scene, who reveals Eckhardt's full plan for reviving the Nephilim. Soon after, Lara rediscovers Bouchard dead. With Luddick's assistance, Lara infiltrates the Cabal's headquarters, the Strahov, {{and in the process}} accidentally frees the Proto-Nephilim, the Cabal's unsuccessful attempt to breed a new Nephilim species. Meanwhile, Lara witnesses Eckhardt murder Luddick. She again encounters Kurtis, who locks her in a compartment while he kills the Proto-Nephilim using two Periapt Shards. After an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> Lara and Kurtis team up to stop Eckhardt assembling the Sanglyph, with Lara retrieving the final Obscura Painting buried deep beneath the Strahov. However, Lara must surrender this painting to save Kurtis, after he is captured by Eckhardt. Kurtis gives Lara his Periapt shards, but she will need a third lost shard to defeat Eckhardt, which Eckhardt has hidden in his laboratory. While Lara flees to track this shard down, Kurtis attempts to hold off an attack from Boaz, the horribly mutated remains of a fallen Cabal member. Kurtis succeeds in killing her, but is severely wounded in the process.|$|E
