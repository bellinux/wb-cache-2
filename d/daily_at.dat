5|$|Yongle demoted Nanjing to a {{secondary}} capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China {{was to be}} at his power base in Beijing. Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing {{hundreds of thousands of}} workers <b>daily.</b> <b>At</b> the center was the political node of the Imperial City, and {{at the center of this}} was the Forbidden City, the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4½ miles.|$|E

May is generally the hottest month with the mean <b>daily</b> maximum temperature <b>at</b> 39.80 °C and the mean <b>daily</b> minimum <b>at</b> 25.40 °C. Days are intensely hot in summer and hot dust-laden winds which below during this season add to the discomfort.

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E

Day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon, and a Day 2 high risk has only been issued twice (for April 7, 2006 and for April 14, 2012).|$|E
5|$|The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, on the Ganges, {{is one of}} the 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva temples in Varanasi. The temple {{has been}} {{destroyed}} and rebuilt several times throughout its existence. The Gyanvapi Mosque, which is adjacent to the temple, is the original site of the temple. The temple, which is also known as the Golden Temple, was built in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The two pinnacles of the temple are covered in gold and were donated in 1839 by Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. The dome is scheduled to receive gold plating through a proposed initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Uttar Pradesh. Numerous rituals, prayers, and aartis are held <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> the temple between 02:30 and 23:00.|$|E

The {{external}} Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> 10:00a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day. Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built. Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station. The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002. Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) {{who is responsible for}} constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is the number of vehicles that travel a road during an average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that an average of only 450 vehicles used the road <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> both termini. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), {{which is responsible for}} maintaining highways in the state, including SR 88. As part of this role, ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes. These surveys are presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around as few as 400 vehicles used the route daily near the Roosevelt Dam and as many as 16,000 <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> the US 60 interchange in Apache Junction. The section east of Canyon Lake is part of the Apache Trail National Forest Scenic Byway system.

5|$|The {{service was}} {{initially}} operated on a charter basis. Having closed {{down over the}} winter, the service was resumed as a scheduled service on 13 April 1949. During 1949, two aircraft carried 2,700 cars. By 1950 the figures had risen to 3,850 cars and 1,000 motorcycles and other vehicles with passengers totalling 15,000. In that year, a London driver offered a London-Paris taxi service. Silver City Airways had estimated that they would carry nearly 7,000 cars in 1953, but this figure was reached in 1951. The three aircraft had to be doubled to six to cope. Over 13,000 vehicles were carried, with 42 return flights <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> peak times. The time between Lympne and Le Touquet was 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded <b>daily</b> <b>at</b> Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
