50|$|The Wing {{performed}} routine transport operations. With assigned {{and attached}} components, the wing performed combat airlift, airdrops, and aeromedical evacuation in Korea throughout the war. For its work between 27 June and 15 September 1950, transporting <b>vital</b> <b>cargo,</b> personnel and evacuating wounded men, the 374th earned its fourth DUC.|$|R
50|$|Owned by Lady Rose Marine Services, she {{remained}} a <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> link to Bamfield until the begin of the 21st century, although her primary cargo {{has always been}} passengers, as she was built as a day-tripper for Union Steamship. She is awaiting restoration in Tofino at Jamie’s Whaling Station since 2012.|$|R
50|$|During the Korean War, {{the ship}} {{supported}} United Nations air operations with <b>vital</b> <b>cargoes</b> of jet fuel and gasoline {{through the year}} 1952. Manned by a mixed crew of Americans and Japanese, Wabash served MSTS through the s:Korean Armistice Agreement {{in the summer of}} 1953 and subsequently carried oil between Iwo Jima and South Korean and Japanese ports through the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|On 9 July, Worden {{headed for}} the South Pacific with Saratoga's task force but was {{temporarily}} detached on the 21st to escort Platte to Nouméa, reaching that port four days later. While Platte took on her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to replenish ships of the carrier task force, Worden patrolled the harbor entrance. On the 28th, Worden and Platte got underway to rejoin Saratoga.|$|R
50|$|Through December of {{that year}} and into the summer of 1952, she {{operated}} out of Sasebo, carrying her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to replenishment areas {{off the coast of}} the embattled Korean peninsula and to shore facilities at Pohang and Pusan. In September, she returned to California for overhaul, but was back in Korean waters to resupply United Nations naval forces in early February 1953.|$|R
50|$|The infantrymen {{were often}} called upon to speed up the {{unloading}} of <b>vital</b> <b>cargoes</b> from convoy ships, before the ships were bombed and sunk in port. So essential were the supplies that unloading would not stop, not even during air raids! Afterwards the supply dumps, where all these supplies were stored, sometimes in the open, would need guarding round the clock.|$|R
50|$|The first United States warship {{in local}} memory to have visited {{this part of}} the world, Trinity {{gathered}} valuable intelligence material on local conditions in Iraq and Iran, including observations of the port-of-entry (Abadan) for war materials slated for use by the Soviet Union. She also collected oceanographic data on the Persian Gulf. After loading her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo,</b> she headed for Fremantle on 17 March.|$|R
500|$|The {{importance}} of trucking is communicated {{by the industry}} adage: [...] "If you bought it, a truck brought it." [...] Retail stores, hospitals, gas stations, garbage disposal, construction sites, banks, and even a clean water supply depends entirely upon trucks to distribute <b>vital</b> <b>cargo.</b> Even before a product reaches store shelves, the raw materials and other stages of production materials that go into manufacturing any given product are moved by trucks.|$|R
50|$|It {{moved to}} Japan in March 1949 {{and when the}} Korean War broke out in June 1950, was the only air {{transport}} group in the Far East. For its work between 27 June and 15 September 1950, transporting <b>vital</b> <b>cargo,</b> personnel and evacuating wounded men, the 374th earned its fourth DUC. In April 1953, the group transported {{the first of several}} groups of repatriated prisoners of war from Korea to Japan.|$|R
5000|$|At sea, {{the paucity}} of the British ships' {{anti-aircraft}} defences was demonstrated in the sinking of [...] on 21 May, [...] on 24 May, and [...] (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along with a <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> of helicopters, runway-building equipment and tents. The loss of {{all but one of}} the Chinook helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor was a severe blow from a logistical perspective.|$|R
5000|$|Here, she {{offloaded}} all her reload torpedoes (keeping {{only those}} in her tubes) and three-inch ammunition, and took on one million rounds of [...]30-caliber ammunition desperately needed by Allied {{forces in the}} Philippines. She sortied 5 February, avoiding the usual traffic lanes, and arrived in Polloc Harbor nine days later. After delivering her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to Mindanao, she returned to Soerabaja with 24 Boeing B-17 specialists from Clark Field on board.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, the Army Air Force's aerial {{transportation}} requirements {{were performed}} by the Air Transport Command which had a dual function of ferrying new aircraft from factories to combat theaters and transportation of troops and supplies, also organized by Tunner. The Naval Air Transport Service focused on supporting deployed Naval and Marine personnel transporting <b>vital</b> <b>cargo,</b> specialist personnel and mail to the Fleet and ground forces, especially in advanced areas of operation.|$|R
50|$|In Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's Hunters of Dune (2006), Duncan and Teg run {{the affairs}} on the no-ship — now named the Ithaca, {{being the only}} two {{passengers}} with experience in military leadership. Teg considers himself responsible {{for the security of}} the Ithaca and its <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> of historical gholas (including those of Teg's own ancestors Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica), produced in transit from genetic material possessed by captive passenger Scytale, purportedly the last Tleilaxu Master.|$|R
5000|$|After overhaul, Copahee {{returned}} to transport duty. Until {{the end of}} the war she made six voyages from Alameda, carrying her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to Manus, Majuro, Guam, Saipan, and Pearl Harbor. From 6 September to 21 December 1945, she operated in [...] "Magic Carpet" [...] duty, returning homeward-bound servicemen from Saipan, Guam, Eniwetok, and the Philippines to the west coast. She {{returned to}} Alameda 21 December 1945, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Tacoma, Washington, 5 July 1946.|$|R
5000|$|Still, when Ariel {{had reached}} a point some 200 {{miles north of the}} Leeward Islands, a lookout {{reported}} a large ship that soon began to approach Ariel. Rather than risk his partially-armed only ship and the <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> and dispatches that she was carrying, Jones reluctantly fled. Jones hoped that she would shake off her pursuer during the night, but the stranger was in full sight when daylight returned the following morning, closer than she had been when last seen the previous evening.|$|R
25|$|In late December 1943 a German Kriegsmarine {{destroyer}} flotilla, {{reinforced by}} six large Elbing-class torpedo boats {{were ordered to}} the Bay of Biscay in order to escort into a French port the blockade runners Osorno and Alsterufer which were carrying <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> from Japan. The Germans codenamed this Operation Bernau. The blockade runner Osorno reached the Gironde on 26 December, but struck a wreck in the estuary after being attacked by the RAF. She was beached and subsequently unloaded offshore. Meanwhile, Alsterufer, carrying tungsten (Wolfram) and rubber, was still much further behind.|$|R
50|$|After shakedown, Jordan arrived New York in mid-March 1944 {{for duty}} as convoy escort. She sailed on 17 April with a convoy bound for Gibraltar, {{arriving}} there on 1 May with transports carrying <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> for the {{operations in the}} Mediterranean area. She returned to New York later that month and made one more European voyage in June before beginning duty as a training ship. During July and August, she engaged in training exercises at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and arrived Port Everglades, Florida, on 17 September to commence experimental exercises in that area.|$|R

50|$|Overhauled, Libra sailed from San Francisco on 20 October for Milne Bay, New Guinea, and Manus, {{where she}} readied for the Lingayen Gulf landings. She entered the Gulf on 11 January 1945, off-loaded her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo,</b> and sailed for Leyte, Ulithi, and Guam. Her final amphibious {{operation}} was the Battle of Iwo Jima, off which she arrived 19 February. For two weeks she maneuvered off the volcanic beaches, avoiding enemy shore batteries as she landed marine combat gear. For {{the remainder of}} the war, Libra carried cargo from Noumea to Leyte and intermediate ports.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Barton is an {{astronaut}} who must deliver a <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> of vaccine to a plague-stricken colony world. However, a young girl, Marilyn, has stowed away on his vessel with hopes of reuniting {{with her brother}} once the vessel reaches the colony world. Now the entire mission is in jeopardy, as her presence on board was not calculated into the flight plan {{and there will be}} no way for the pilot to compensate for her added weight. There are no others ships which can pick her up prior to arrival at their destination.|$|R
5000|$|By July of 1950 war {{had broken}} out in Korea, and she was ordered {{reactivated}} for transfer to the US Navy. On 5 August, she {{was assigned to the}} Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) and, manned by a civil service crew, she was placed in service in September as USNS Sgt. Truman Kimbro (T-AK-254). Throughout the Korean War, the ship was primarily employed in moving <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> across the Pacific Ocean to United Nations forces fighting on that embattled peninsula. She also made shorter runs to Alaskan ports and to central Pacific bases.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 December 1941, Vega {{arrived at}} Honolulu, Hawaii — her holds laden with {{ammunition}} for the Naval Ammunition Depot, Pearl Harbor, and an Army derrick barge in tow — moored to Pier 31 and commenced unloading her cargo at 0100 on 7 December. When Japanese aircraft swept over Oahu, Vega went to general quarters, opening fire with her anti-aircraft guns, as civilian stevedores continued the arduous job of unloading her dangerous cargo. Since the Japanese were after bigger game, the [...] "Hog Islander" [...] and her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> {{emerged from the}} attack unscathed.|$|R
50|$|In January 1925, she {{returned}} to the Pacific for winter maneuvers; then, in April, departed San Francisco for Hawaii to support units participating in joint Army-Navy exercises. During May and June, she carried fuel oil and gasoline from California to Hawaii; and, in July, she carried her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to Samoa. On the 21st, {{she returned}} to Pearl Harbor; but, by the middle of August, was again en route west. After a stop at Wellington, N.Z., she once more delivered petroleum products to Samoa; and, on 1 September, she departed Tutuila to return to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Securing abreast godowns (warehouses) 52, 53, and 54, West Point {{commenced}} off-loading {{equipment and}} disembarking her troops. All but 670 engineer troops, {{who had been}} ordered retained on board, were ashore before nightfall. Air raids, meanwhile, continued until midnight as the Japanese steadily pounded Singapore from the air. At each alert, the local workers working dockside would vanish, taking to the shelters and leaving the <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> still unloaded. As a result, the unloading {{was carried out by}} the crew of West Point, her embarked troops, and 22 local workers who were brought aboard to assist.|$|R
50|$|Most anti-shipping {{strategies}} primarily aim at {{a relatively}} narrow set of goals. For example, a traditional practice of the Royal Navy during wars between Britain and France was blockade. By concentrating available naval units forces near the major French ports, the Royal Navy was usually able to strangle French trade and create significant economic difficulties. Similarly, the enemy may focus on ships carrying strategically <b>vital</b> <b>cargos</b> such as hemp and timber or, in modern times, oil and iron. Alternatively, the aim may be to target ships carrying particularly valuable cargos such as treasure or munitions, and ships carrying less critical cargoes or steaming in ballast are assigned a lower priority.|$|R
5000|$|Following an Atlantic shakedown, Rankin steamed on 26 March 1945 {{in company}} with [...] for the Panama Canal Zone. Joining the Pacific Fleet on 1 April, she loaded Marine Corps {{replacement}} equipment at San Francisco and steamed independently for Hawaii on 17 April. Intensive training in shipboard procedures and amphibious techniques followed. She then took on 5,000 tons of Army ammunition at Honolulu and, in company with , steamed on 25 May for Ulithi. Escorted by , the two ships immediately {{went on to}} deliver their <b>vital</b> <b>cargoes</b> at Okinawa. During her 17 days at the Battle of Okinawa, the ship faced more than 100 air raids by kamikaze. All ammunition was offloaded between air raids.|$|R
5000|$|... == World War II service == Following {{shakedown}} in the Chesapeake Bay, Oconee, {{manned by}} a U.S. Coast Guard crew, sailed to Bermuda and Aruba before transiting the Panama Canal 15 March 1945. Stopping briefly at San Diego, California, the gasoline tanker proceeded to Pearl Harbor, arriving there 4 May. After a short upkeep period she sailed unescorted to Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, thence on to Ulithi. From mid-June {{to the end}} of July she serviced all sizes of ships and craft in the huge anchorage then steamed to Okinawa with her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo.</b> She remained there {{through the end of the}} war, serving ships of the mighty U.S. fleet and riding out two treacherous typhoons.|$|R
50|$|In {{the days}} that followed, Thuban {{continued}} to unload her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> to supply the forces on shore, furnished ammunition for light cruiser , and took on casualties from Marine and Army units on the beach, occasionally approaching within {{less than a mile}} of the shore. Despite frequent air alerts, the attack cargo ship was soon remaining in the transport area unloading through the night. Toward midnight on the night of 22 June and 23 June, a shell from an enemy battery on Tinian passed low over the number three hatch and burst nearby on the port beam, but Thuban escaped damage. All hands remained at battle stations during the night as Thuban took on casualties, made smoke, and continued unloading.|$|R
5000|$|After that raid, it {{was obvious}} that Cavite and Manila Bay were not safe for surface ships. Hastily {{assembled}} convoys began heading southward, but George G. Henry remained behind where her <b>vital</b> <b>cargo</b> was needed. On 12 December - the day on which Japanese troops splashed ashore at Aparri and Vigan in northern Luzon and at Legaspi on the southeast coast of that island - George G. Henry was moored at Pier 7, the largest commercial pier in Manila's port area and an easily distinguishable landmark, to discharge her remaining cargo. By that evening, the tanker had pumped ashore [...] of oil to storage tanks ashore. That task completed, George G. Henry returned to her anchorage to await further orders.|$|R
50|$|Manned by a {{civilian}} crew, she {{participated in the}} Korean supply run from Japan supporting the repulse of Communist aggression in South Korea.

50|$|Departing Norfolk, Virginia, on 20 April 1943, Millicoma steamed via the Dutch West Indies and the Panama Canal {{to carry}} a cargo of fuel oil and {{gasoline}} to the Fiji Islands. During the remainder of 1943 she continued to carry <b>vital</b> liquid <b>cargoes</b> to American bases in the South Pacific.|$|R
50|$|And in {{response}} to American efforts to protect the integrity and independence of South Vietnam from external Communist aggression, she resumed intermittent cargo runs to South Vietnam in February 1962. She remained in the Western Pacific, serving the forces of freedom in the Far East as a veteran carrier of <b>vital</b> military <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
50|$|Completing {{conversion}} at New York City on 26 May 1942, Libra loaded combat {{equipment at}} Hampton Roads and sailed on 10 June for Wellington, New Zealand, arriving 11 July. Laden with cargo for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, she sailed 22 July for rehearsals in the Fijis {{for the first}} Allied offensive of the Pacific War, the Solomons campaign. Libra arrived off Tulagi on 7 August, and began an unloading interrupted six times {{in the next three}} days, as enemy air attack caused her to go to general quarters and stand off to maneuver in open waters. In the early morning 9 August she heard heavy gunfire to the northwest, where Allied warships engaged the Japanese in the Battle of Savo Island, fighting to protect the transports and their <b>vital</b> <b>cargo.</b> Later the same day, empty, she sailed for Wellington, arriving 20 August.|$|R
