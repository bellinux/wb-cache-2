5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E

Simple photoionization models reproduce the observed spectra, providing <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> beyond that supplied by photoionization is assumed (Reynolds, Haffner, & Tufte 1999). With observed gas-phase abundances (not solar), the line ratios in the local arm at b = 0 deg are fitted with no <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> and (S/H) = 13 ppm (solar is 20 ppm). Local gas observed at b = - 35 deg requires <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> of about gamma = 0. 75, where gamma is the <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> in units of 10 ^{- 25 } erg H^{- 1 } s^{- 1 }. In the Perseus arm, there are similar results, with a domposition consistent with the Galactic abundance gradient. The requirements for NGC 891 {{are similar to the}} Perseus arm: little or no <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> at |z| = 1 kpc and gamma 3 at 2 kpc. In NGC 891 there is also an increase of 5007 /H-alpha with |z| that can only come about if most of the ionizing radiation is supplied by stars with T~ 50000 K.

25|$|Placing a {{conductive}} {{thick plate}} as a heat transfer interface between a heat source {{and a cold}} flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the cooling performance. In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled {{in direct contact with}} the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> transfer surface area, that is quite different from fins (extended surfaces).|$|E
25|$|The {{associated}} problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, {{there would}} be increased pressure on the remaining two, and {{if one of them}} popped out the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to Galileo revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun any closer than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had to be protected from that <b>extra</b> <b>heat,</b> part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one device drivers had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the heat protection. They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.|$|E
25|$|In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To {{improve on}} the {{performance}} afforded by the 441–515kW (600–700PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223kW (300PS) {{at the cost of}} an additional 181kg (400lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> generated by the DB 601 and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing nose mounted radiator sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to beneath the wings' undersurfaces immediately outboard of the juncture between the wing root and wing panel, just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller. To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down {{to make room for the}} radiator ducting. Because the radiators were now mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing's camber, the overall cooling installation was more efficient than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra ducting and piping, which could be vulnerable to battle damage. In addition, the lowered undercarriage could throw up mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.|$|E

500|$|The fine {{particulate}} matter produced by car exhaust {{and other human}} sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei, leads {{to the production of}} clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up {{over the course of the}} week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' Eastern Seaboard, the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays. The urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 °C (1.1 to 10.1 °F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{observations of}} the diffuse ionized gas through the emission lines Hα, [NII], and [SII] in the Perseus Arm of our Galaxy by the Wisconsin Hα Mapper (WHAM) [...] survey challenge photoionization models. They have to explain the observed rise in the line ratios [NII]/Hα and [SII]/Hα. The models described here consider {{for the first time}} the detailed observational geometry toward the Perseus Arm. The models address the vertical variation of the line ratios up to height of 2 kpc above the midplane. The rising trends of the line ratios are matched. The increase in the line ratios is reflected in a rise of the temperature of the gas layer. This is due to the progressive hardening of the radiation going through the gas. However an <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> above photoionization is needed to explain the absolute values. Two different <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> rates are investigated which are proportional to n^ 0 and n^ 1.

2500|$|A {{heat sink}} {{transfers}} thermal energy from a higher temperature device {{to a lower}} temperature fluid medium. The fluid medium is frequently air, but can also be water, refrigerants or oil. If the fluid medium is water, the heat sink is frequently called a cold plate.

[...] Practical heat sinks for electronic devices must have a temperature higher than the surroundings to transfer heat by convection, radiation, and conduction.

2500|$|Sulfuric acid {{is capable}} of causing very severe burns, {{especially}} when it is at high concentrations.

Accordingly, it rapidly attacks the cornea and can induce permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes. If ingested, it damages internal organs irreversibly and may even be fatal. [...] Protective equipment should hence always be used when handling it. Moreover, its strong oxidizing property makes it highly corrosive to many metals and may extend its destruction on other materials. Because of such reasons, damage posed by sulfuric acid is potentially more severe than that by other comparable strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.|$|E

We consider the effect of different prescriptions for non–gravitational ICM heating, such as supernova (SN) energy feedback, as predicted by semi–analytical models of galaxy formation, and two different minimum entropy floors, Sfl = 50 and 100 keV cm 2, imposed at z = 3. Simulations with only gravitational heating nicely reproduce predictions from self–similar ICM models, while <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> is shown to break the self– similarity, by a degree which depends on total injected energy and on cluster mass. We use observational results on the excess entropy in central regions of galaxy systems, to constrain the amount of extra–heating required.

2500|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} mechanism for rapid methane release. [...] As the Arctic Ocean {{becomes more and}} more ice free, the ocean absorbs more of the incident energy from the sun. The Arctic Ocean becomes warmer than the former ice cover and much more water vapour enters the air.

[...] As the air rises, the dew point is reached and clouds form, releasing latent heat and further reinforcing the buoyancy of the air over the ocean. [...] All this results in air being drawn from the south across the tundra rather than the present situation of cold air flowing toward the south from the cold sinking air over the Arctic Ocean.
