25|$|In 2009 a {{group of}} British doctors who had not {{had access to the}} evidence, {{including}} Michael Powers who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> barrister and former coroner, challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that {{the cause of death was}} untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence, who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.|$|E
