40|$|Children, <b>Film</b> and <b>Literacy</b> {{explores the}} role of film in {{children}}'s lives. The films children engage in provide them with imaginative spaces in which they create, play and perform familiar and unfamiliar, fantasy and everyday narratives and this narrative play is closely connected to identity, literacy and textual practices. Family {{is key to the}} encouragement of this social play and, at school, the playground is also an important site for this activity. However, in the literacy classroom, some children encounter a discontinuity between their experiences of narrative at home and those that are valued in school. Through film children develop understandings of the common characteristics of narrative and the particular 'language' of film. This book demonstrates the ways in which children are able to express and develop distinct and complex understandings of narrative, that is to say, where they can draw on their own experiences (including those in a moving image form). Children whose primary experiences of narrative are moving images face particular challenges when their experiences are not given opportunities for expression in the classroom, and this has urgent implications for the teaching of literacy...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the term}} {{literacy}} has led {{a life of}} its own, particularly as it has become linked with certain programs and catchy slogans.

The difficulty with some of them is that the term is used as if the user knew what it meant. Saying a term and knowing it are entirely different kinds of human behaviors. To be more pointed, because one uses the term technological literacy does not, in any way, carry with it an understanding of the meaning of technological literacy.

The book is an adapted version of Parry’s dissertation involving case studies of six UK primary school students using filmmaking practices to enhance their emerging literacy skills. She created and taught a special class with year 5 students at a primary school in Sheffield, UK (equivalent to fourth grade in the US). Parry used action research design to investigate how the six students understand and interpret narratives by creating different filmmaking activities.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gather {{information}} on whether or not the director’s commentary feature on a DVD could develop teachers’ Film Study knowledge and skills. This mini-dissertation was directed by the following research question: can the additional information on DVDs enhance teachers’ knowledge and potential for effective teaching of Film Study? In an attempt to answer the above question a literature review was conducted to establish the importance of Professional Development and Film Study. The director’s commentary feature was then investigated as a possible development resource. By means of a qualitative Case Study that used an open-ended questionnaire and focus group interviews, data was collected from nine respondents from two different East Rand High Schools. These findings were analysed, coded and written up. The literature study also incorporates a discussion on three different types of <b>literacy,</b> <b>Film</b> Study and Film Theory. This led to the director’s commentary feature being presented as a development resource for Film Study teachers. Research indicates that Film Study is viewed as important and is valued as a part of the South African Language curriculum. This research recognises that there is a need to develop Film Study teachers in South Africa. The director’s commentary feature found on DVDs was provided as a possible solution as a Film Study development resource. Literature findings state that a director is the person responsibility for a film’s decision making process. This highlights the importance of the director and the value of the director’s commentary. However, field research could not generate a definite result some respondents found the commentary useful, whereas others did not. Whilst certain conclusions can be made regarding the director’s commentary feature, literature and field research did not correlate. Thus, the director’s commentary feature as a Film Study development resource is open for further exploration. Mrs. Catherine van der Merwe Mr. David Robinso...|$|R

During the open coding stage, data revealed twelve categories that contributed to the four axial codes of Self, Beyond Self, Critical Connections, and Representations of Literacy. The four axial codes contributed to three different themes that emerged in the representations of literacy in popular school film: internal versus external forces, traditional versus non- traditional pedagogy, and traditional representations of literacy versus new literacies. A grounded theory based upon the research data proposes a symbiotic relationship between educational policy and the portrayal of literacy pedagogy in serious school film.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{what happens when}} historical feature film is used in history education. The purpose of this thesis is to develop new knowledge of historical <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> through {{a study of the}} feature film's didactical potential in an educa­tional context. This is carried out through an analysis of the historical meaning making among upper secondary students when viewing historical feature films, and special attention is paid to the importance of emotions in the students' meaning making through historical feature film. A focus of the study is the didactical dilemma, previously addressed in historical film research, that arises in the use of feature film in history or social studies education, in relation to educational context, film experience, and historical understanding. The present thesis is an independent continuation of my licentiate thesis History as Fiction (2014). The empirical material consists of interviews with students and teachers from two upper secondary schools in Sweden, as well as documentation from students' assessments and selected scenes from feature films experienced by the students as they were used in history class. The theoretical framework for the study takes an interdisciplinary approach. It is based on Jörn Rüsens under­standing of historical meaning and histo­ri­cal culture, as well as on transaction theory described by John Dewey and Louise M. Rosenblatt. Film reception theory is equally important, represented by theories from David Bordwell and Carl Plantinga. The main research question focused on how the concept of historical <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> could be developed theoretically. Historical <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> is understood in this thesis as an advanced consciousness of how historical meaning making is created through the individual's transaction with film's narration in a specific context, and how meaning making ideally links historical disciplinary thinking with practical orientation in life. The core of theoretically developed historical <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> is an understanding of the individual's emotional and aesthetic experience of historical feature film, and elaborated theoretical knowledge about the close relationship between the affective response and the more distanced cognitive activity during and after watching a film. Also crucial for historical <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> is an under­standing of the historical film's representation of the past as a conflation of facts and fiction. The knowledge of history that students' gain from historical feature film should be constructed in a synthesis of an aesthetic and an efferent stance in the transaction process. This is because the feature film has the capacity to stimulate both a feeling of empathy and of nearness in the viewer as well as a movement of the viewer away from the narration and towards more distanced cognition. This movement helps the viewer to analyze and interpret the historical meaning making from a critical perspective, when the experience of the feature film is transformed to a reflected experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of DVD technology prompted {{a surge in}} subtitling {{a large number of}} Egyptian films into English. Although subtitling has been around in Egypt since the early thirties of the past century, most of the activity has been into Arabic only. Most western universities have been debating audiovisual translation issues for the last decade. Yet contribution from Arabic has been virtually negligible. The increasing number of Egyptian films subtitled onto DVD has prompted the examination of subtitling Arabic language films. In the current study, the subtitling of Egyptian classic films is examined. The study looks at the current professional practice, the quality of the subtitling and the teaching of screen translation in Egypt. The study will argue that the current subtitling practice is flawed as it remains oblivious to three significant factors that impact on the training of subtitlers and consequently on the quality of subtitling. These factors are 1) the lack of formal debate of subtitling in translation curricula, 2) the reliance on the dialogue list as an economical way of producing subtitles and 3) the lack of <b>film</b> <b>literacy.</b> The research examines the first film produced by the DVD industry in Egypt. The film, featuring Omar Sharif, is widely considered an Egyptian classic. It applies a multimodal analysis of thirty significant scenes in the film and highlights the common challenges in the subtitling which were not met. It will argue that failure to meet the challenges is primarily due to the above three factors which seriously hamper the production of quality subtitling in Egypt. The major conclusion reached is that <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> is a must for audiovisual culture to take root in the country...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} moral education of young citizens in early 21 st century Germany through {{the study of}} Filmbildung (film education) efforts. While the beliefs and practices informing film education and moral education may not appear closely related at first sight, this dissertation reveals {{a number of important}} connections, and analyzes their implications. German politicians, public intellectuals, and educators promote film education programs for students by arguing that media competence or <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> are crucial abilities for fostering communicative competence, analytical skills, and the ability to actively participate in the public sphere. However, in practice they rarely specify these claims. I identify several factors that enable disjunctures between official rhetoric about film education and their everyday articulation, and argue that these are partly due to a hegemonic belief in the value of Bildung. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with institutions promoting film education programs for children and teenagers, this ethnography traces the historical and cultural trajectories that inspired the emergence and proliferation of film education programs and their disjunctive implementations. Current film education efforts build on a tradition of self-cultivation, edification, and transformation through the engagement with written texts and the German tradition of the Bildungsroman. However, these understandings of literacy and <b>film</b> <b>literacy</b> do not acknowledge the ways in which film education efforts may unwittingly reinforce social inequalities. This ethnography allows us to identify local and national understandings about the relationships between film, Bildung, and the ability to articulate political and social concerns—understandings that are presupposed by many who attempt to implement Filmbildung. My analysis reveals how talk about film both reflects and co-constructs social and political practices, and investigates the moralizing practices that inform beliefs about education and civic participation. This work speaks to anthropological research on literacy and civic participation, on the relationship between audiences and publics, and on moral education...|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{listening}} practices in 1970 s China and examines the cinematic soundtracks {{of a handful of}} films, domestic and foreign, that were edited specifically for the purpose of radio broadcasting. Coined as 'edited film recording', this made-for-radio sonic compilation is a new product, one that takes crucial pieces from the original soundtrack but has significant editorial input, specifically in the insertion of an omniscient narrator. The narrator tells the story, expands narrative at times and comes in at crucial moments to drive key messages home. Film production was also designed for auditory consumption outside of the theatre, on gramophone and radio, before television entered individual households in China. <b>Film</b> <b>literacy</b> thus could be achieved without an actual access to the film products themselves. The hybridity of the genre created an illusion of broader and equal access to the symbolic order of a socialist visual culture.
