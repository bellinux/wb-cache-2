40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{overview}} of a completed doctoral thesis that focuses on the application of evolutionary theory to various aspects of project management. Design/methodology/approach – Generally speaking the methods of research are founded on the epistemological framework of co-evolution which regards human values, preferences, artefacts, and behaviours as evolutionary adaptations in the same way one would regard bipedal walking. A conceptual evolutionary (memetic) framework is developed to explore the prevalence of project management concepts, practices, and artefacts in a Darwinian manner. Findings – The findings of this thesis can be summarised by saying; that we are hardwired for project management as our behaviours and artefacts are encoded across our biology and our culture; that some are drawn to aspects of project management because they get an emotional fix from it; that modern project management is not founded on evidence-based practices, rather it <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it has for reasons other than that it leads to successful project delivery; that aspects of modern project management reflect the morals and values of our largely Judaeo-Christian culture; and that the various concepts, practices, and artefacts of project management are loaded with local meanings which are selected and passed on to others. Practical implications – This thesis makes a contribution to the field by developing a new philosophy of project management that is concerned with raising questions, with the assistance of an evolutionary framework, about how one should consider projects and project management, why various concepts, practices and artefacts are more prevalent than others, what are their essential natures and how they are being adapted, and how we might go about progressing project management into the future. Originality/value – This thesis proposes and advances an evolutionary framework for project management research...|$|E

40|$|Give {{yourself}} {{a moment to}} ponder just how bizarre intimate sex through copulation is: one individual inserts a part of its anatomy into a delicate part of another individual. In The Dawn of the Deed, paleoarcheologist John Long encourages the reader to examine the oddity of sexual intercourse. He depicts this peculiarity by illustrating that somewhere along the phylogenetic tree, a male of some archaic species physically penetrated his female counterpart. What a strange occurrence that must have been! Inspired by his discovery of the oldest-known fossil demonstrating internal fertilization, Materpiscis attenboroughi (a placoderm fish dated to be 540 million years old), Long takes the reader on a journey through the evolution of sexual reproduction. He uses {{the discovery of the}} embryo found within Masterpiscis attenboroughi {{as a starting point for}} a detailed account of the sexual anatomy and behavior of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, primates and, eventually, humans. Using a combination of evidence found in living species as well as clues preserved in the fossil record, Long provides a thorough account of how and why sexual reproduction might <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that it did.

40|$|About the book: This volume {{presents}} a rich {{account of the}} development of accreditation and evaluation in 20 European countries. The authors are leaders in the field and they have cooperated in this effort by writing richly different, often deep and insightful analyses of the situation in their country. The two editors have added a synopsis detailing the main trends, and sketching commonalities as well as contrasts in the developments across Europe. The book shows how accreditation is becoming a main mechanism in the steering of higher education all over Europe. The book is unique in its analysis of forces driving towards the spread of different models of accreditation in the emerging European Higher Education area. Readers will obtain an up-to-date picture of the state of affairs of accreditation in the framework of evaluation activities in Europe. They will gain an understanding of why accreditation and evaluation systems <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they <b>have,</b> and subsequently, they will obtain more realistic views on potentialities for European comparability and cooperation in this area. This volume is of interest to researchers and policy-making staff in higher education, especially those involved at the level of national systems for quality assurance, accreditation, internationalization and the Bologna process. It is also of interest to Master/PhD students in (higher) education management...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays and {{according}} to Ries (2006 : 14) the mass communication that has been implemented in a globalized world is branded by five ‘revolutions’ that <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> information is exchanged, allowing to share ideas or opinions of any kind with speed and ease. There is a direct correlation between {{each one of these}} mass communication revolutions that have been democratized and {{the start of a new}} interaction era. That way, such revolutions are defined by a particular mean of communication. These means are: 1) The book, which main characteristic is the information mass distribution as first communication revolution. 2) Newspapers, in which the main characteristic is the periodicity added to the mass distribution. This is the second revolution. 3) The radio broadcast, which has as characteristics the mass distribution, the immediacy and the audio. 4) Television, which adds to the previously mentioned characteristics the movement of images. 5) Finally the Internet, the fifth revolution implied a new element in the transmission of ideas: the interactivity.

The electronic information –due to its nature– has now a more democratic approach of operation, plummeting the power of the great companies and governments.

40|$|Among megapodes, several {{incubation}} stategies can be recognized. Eggs are incubated by {{heat generated}} from microbial decomposition, volcanism, or the sun.

40|$|The intracratonic rift-related Mesoproterozoic Rampur Shale in Kudri, India {{formed in}} the marine mid- and outer shelf domain. It bears a {{dominant}} imprint of shore-parallel, storm-driven flow, as predicted by oceanographers for modem shelves, and thus differs from other ancient storm deposits in the geological record. In the Rampur Shale, gutters are shore-parallel, while tool marks of various kinds are both shore-parallel and shore-normal, and show bipolarity in both directions. Hydrodynamic analysis and inter-relationships between the flow features suggest that the storm-driven flow was shore-parallel, dominantly unidirectional and steady initially, and that it became increasingly unsteady thereafter, while also becoming dominantly shore-normal during peak oscillation. As storm conditions waned, the gutters were filled by sediments under dominant wave influence.

40|$|Intermediary {{metabolism}} molecules are orchestrated into logical pathways {{stemming from}} history (L-amino acids, D-sugars) and dynamic constraints (hydrolysis of pyrophosphate or amide groups {{is the driving}} force of anabolism). Beside essential metabolites, numerous variants derive from programmed or accidental changes. Broken down, variants enter standard pathways, producing further variants. Macromolecule modification alters enzyme reactions specificity. Metabolism conform thermodynamic laws, precluding strict accuracy. Hence, for each regular pathway, a wealth of variants inputs and produces metabolites that are similar to but not the exact replicas of core metabolites. As corollary, a shadow, paralogous metabolism, is associated to standard metabolism. We focus on a logic of paralogous metabolism based on diversion of the core metabolic mimics into pathways where they are modified to minimize their input in the core pathways where they create havoc. We propose that a significant proportion of paralogues of well-characterized enzymes <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> as <b>the</b> natural <b>way</b> to cope with paralogous metabolites.

Data from two surveys (N= 302, N= 214) are used to analyze how Facebook use, social and psychological factors, self-efficacy, and types of instructorstudent communication on Facebook are related to positive and negative collaboration among students. We found that predictors of Facebook use for class organizing behaviors include self-efficacy and perceived motivation to communicate with others using the site. When placed in the context of social and psychological factors, Facebook intensity did not predict either positive or negative collaboration, suggesting that how students used the site, rather than how often they used the tool or how important they felt it was, affected their propensity to collaborate...|$|R
