500|$|An {{experienced}} theatre and serial director, Roger Michell {{was chosen}} to direct Persuasion, in {{what was to be}} his first feature film. As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. [...] "I was the only boy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>class</b> who took Austen as a special paper", he said. His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical. [...] He described the work as an [...] "erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning". While directing, Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen's story, seen for instance between [...] "the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm, wet feel of Uppercross". The Royal Navy was another point of interest, as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories. The director wished to depict the integration of cultures, as naval officers came back with [...] "an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before".|$|E

My teaching qualifications consisted of one three-hour tutoring workshop, and at 23, I was younger than many students <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> I was worried that this would translate into a lack of authority and an inability to teach effectively. It took me some time to realise that these factors, counter-intuitively, worked as a natural advantage <b>in</b> <b>my</b> interactions with students. The key to this advantage, however, lay in responding to students’ expectations of me, and recognising differences in the roles of tutors and full-time academic staff...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to creating lectures {{that are more}} active and participatory, another interesting way to engage and inform students is through guests in the classroom. Guests can fill various roles, in {{addition to}} getting students excited about the discipline. Over the years, I have had various guests <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes,</b> ranging from academic experts in the field, experts in the workplace or individuals who have strong personal stories to share - for example: a sustainability professor to cover the environmental issues {{we are faced with}} today and may expect in the future, representatives from such organizations/companies as Institute for the Future (IFTF) to discuss skills necessary to become a professional futurist, and a Holocaust survivor to emphasize some important historical contexts (a very popular visitor <b>in</b> <b>my</b> peace studies <b>classes).</b> At times, it may be difficult for the guest speaker to visit in person, consequently, they may be invited to participate via audio-visual means.|$|R

In this paper, I will detail the published benefits of collaborative learning that led me to use this <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> The introduction of collaborative learning exercises into my lectures has also brought a number of problems and fears including time constraints, the practical issues of forming groups in large classes, and the barrier students have towards working together.

40|$|With {{increased}} awareness {{of the presence of}} second language writers in courses and programs across the disciplines comes increased requests for faculty development focused on second language writing. Drawing from scholarship on second language writing pedagogy and theory, as well as the author’s experience as an instructor of ESL writing and a WAC program director, this chapter presents approaches to working with faculty on issues related to L 2 writers. After discussing alliances WAC program leaders can make with other groups on campus who work with L 2 writers, this chapter presents a framework for thinking about the differences in L 2 writing when compared to writing by na-tive English speakers and approaches for working with faculty during consultations and workshops, with specific attention to shifting faculty perspectives on L 2 writing from a difference-as-deficit stance (Canaga-rajah, 2002) to a difference-accommodated stance, and ultimately, a difference-as-resource stance (Canagarajah, 2002). Throughout the chapter, specific workshop activities and materials are shared. My experience with teaching ESL students is that they have often not received adequate English instruction to complete the required essay texts and papers <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> I have been particularly dismayed when I find that they have already completed 2 ESL courses and have no knowledge of the parts of speech or the terminology that is used in correcting English grammar on papers.

5000|$|Because Radcliffe's faculty was Harvard's, in the college's first 50 years professors from Harvard - each under {{individual}} {{contracts with}} the Radcliffe administration - duplicated lectures, providing them first for men in the Harvard Yard and then crossing the Cambridge Common to provide the same lectures to women in the Radcliffe Yard.
