In the absence of daily live programs such as TRL, It's on with Alexa Chung and The Seven to facilitate such segments, the channel now uses MTV First as its newest approach to present music video premieres and bring viewers from its main television channel to its website for real-time interaction with artists and celebrities.|$|E
500|$|Britton and Rose {{believe that}} M. spinosissima {{has been in}} {{cultivation}} since at least 1835. The species thrives in well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH that is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. They prefer low humidity, and grow well under glass, with full, filtered sun from the south, north, and east. Plants are typically watered once <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> and kept nearly dry during the winter months. Propagation is facilitated by offsets of seeds sown in early spring in [...] weather. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are disease resistant, but are susceptible to pests such as mealybugss.|$|E

In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

She had {{previously}} appeared in Holby City sister show Casualty, {{and had made}} an appearance in Holby City fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After {{a series of three}} meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", stating: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting.

500|$|<b>Every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> Lasseter and {{his team}} would put {{together}} their latest set of storyboards or footage to show Disney. In early screen tests, Pixar impressed Disney with the technical innovation but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each presentation by Pixar, Katzenberg would tear much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg's big push was to add more edginess to the two main characters. Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and asked for adult references {{to be added to}} the film. After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm. Tom Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk. Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993, an event they later dubbed [...] "The Black Friday Incident." [...] The results were disastrous, and Schneider, who was never particularly enamored of Katzenberg's idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, declared it a mess and ordered that production be stopped immediately. Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad. Schumacher replied bluntly: [...] "Because it's not their movie anymore, it's completely not the movie that John set out to make." ...|$|E

2500|$|Italian troops {{captured}} Ghat in the south-west of {{the province}} in August 1914, which prompted an uprising and forced the Italians out of Ghat and Ghadames. The call to jihad had more effect among the Senussi than elsewhere and Ahmad began the jihad in Fezzan in southern Libya. The Italians re-captured Ghadames in February 1916 but the blockade on the Senussi had little military effect, since they were well stocked with captured Italian weapons; Italian garrisons in Cyrenaica were withdrawn to reinforce the west. Ottoman–German operations in Tripolitania were based at Misratah, where a submarine visited <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> to deliver arms and ammunition and in May 1917 a wireless station was built. Ottoman troops established about twenty posts on the coast and by 1918 had [...] troops, a similar number in training and another [...] reservists. In September 1918, having been prevented from entering Tripolitania by the Ottoman forces, Sayed Ahmed boarded a German submarine at al-Aqaila and went into exile in Turkey. In Tripolitania, local troops under al-Shtaiwi and Ottoman regular soldiers under Nuri Bey and Suliman al-Baruni, resisted the Italians {{until the end of}} the war. Archaeological analysis of the salt pan of Kallaya, the site of a minor skirmish between Libyans on 14 November 1918, shows that they had Russian rifles captured by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians on the Eastern front and sent to Libya via the Ottomans.|$|E

[...] After various revisions and tryouts, it was finally produced under its current title at Maine State Music Theatre in 1998. A producer introduced Yeston to Alan Jay Lerner to show him a song from the show, [...] "New Words", and [...] "Lerner thought the song was so wonderful he invited me to stop by his office <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> so he could give me pointers. He said Oscar Hammerstein had done that for him and he wanted to do that for me. So, I really got coaching lessons – mentoring – in a series of meetings with Alan Jay Lerner as a result of having written that song." [...] In 1988 Yeston recorded a studio recording of a musical entitled , produced by the noted Phil Ramone. Plácido Domingo sang the role of Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, with Jennifer Rush, Gloria Estefan, Dionne Warwick, Richie Havens, and Seiko Matsuda. [...] Domingo was interested in starring in a stage musical about Goya and suggested to producer Alan Carr that Yeston would be the right person to create the vehicle, since Domingo had admired Yeston's work on Nine. [...] Because of Domingo's time commitments, the musical was made into a concept album instead.|$|E
