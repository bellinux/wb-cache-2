40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the effect of silage density on quality and efficiency of crop preservation. Feed quality is reduced in loosely packed silos because of de-creased dry mater and nutrient losses from aerobic deterioration. Adequate packing in the silo to attain the minimum recommended density of dry matter is a challenge. This study estimates how packing tractor weight, silage dry matter, rate of fill and blade layer work together to effect dry matter density. Increasing packing tractor weight, number of packing tractors and reducing layer thickness result in increased dry matter density. High density in horizontal silos minimises losses and reduces storage costs. High density reduces the porosity of the crop and a higher density in-creases the storage capacity of the silo. Density increased from top to bottom of horizontal silos and significant difference in silage densities across the face of the pile are noted. Lower densities are consistently registered along silo walls, therefore extra attention should be paid to packing along the silo walls. Using a heavy tractor with narrow tyres could be a way to reduce feed losses. Only an experienced operator should be employed to pack along a wall with a heavy tractor. Silage should not be packed too high or too steep, as that could increase the likelihood of rolling the packing tractor over. Silage density in <b>horizontal</b> <b>silo</b> is most strongly influenced by packing layer thickness (L), tractor weight (mv), packing time per ton as-fed (tu) and dry matter content (DM). Muck and Holmes (2000) proposed that the relationship between these four factors forms the packing factor (PF). Silage density is moreover influenced by delivery rate, moisture content, dimensions of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>silo</b> and particle length.

Kansas produces about 3. 0 million tons of silage annually, primarily from corn and sorghum. A majority of this silage is made and stored in either bunker, trench, or "drive-over" pile silos. Only 20 to 30 % of these silos are sealed after filling. Producers who do not seal need to take a second look at the economics of this highly troublesome "technology" before they reject it as unnecessary and uneconomical.

This two-dimensional horizontal setup allows to uncouple pressure and velocity and, therefore, to independently control the velocity at which the disks escape the <b>horizontal</b> <b>silo</b> and the pressure {{in the vicinity of the}} aperture. The flow rate is found to be directly proportional to the belt velocity, independent of the amount of disks in the container and, thus, independent of the pressure in the outlet region.

40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{discharged}} from nuclear power reactors has accumulated {{to a considerable}} amount in Japan and the other countries with nuclear power generation stocks, which will lead to risks of their overflow beyond the existing management capacities at those nuclear power plants. If such overflow happens, the power plant has {{to be shut down}} until appropriate measures have been taken. Meanwhile, uncertainties have accumulated surrounding final treatment facilities, either reprocessing or geological disposal, reflecting difficulties to find appropriate sites caused by oppositions of local and/or general public and other factors. As a result, spent nuclear fuel has to be stored for the time being in interim devices for a certain time period, e. g. 20 years to 40 - 50 years, until such time that they can be moved to their final destination. The objective of this dissertation is to review theoretical background and thoughts relevant to policy considerations on spent nuclear fuel management and storage ranging from their discharge to final treatment, to obtain quantitative images, and ultimately to present desirable policies and their implications in medium and long range in Japan. Essential key questions to be addressed here include the following, to which the dissertation presents first the theoretical framework to obtain answers and then answers at the moment while encompassing underlying uncertainties://・When and to what extent spent nuclear fuel storage will be required, and which type of technology options should be applied?//・How long should it be the appropriate storage duration? How does it connect to the overall nuclear fuel cycle program?//・Which should be chosen, AR (At Reactor) storage, AFR (Away From Reactor) storage or a combination of both?//・How will it cost?//・How will the price for storage services be determined?//After presenting these objectives and key questions in Chapter 1, the dissertation first discusses in Chapter 2 the present status of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan, which clarifies where the dissertation stands at this moment. As spent nuclear fuel accumulates at all the nuclear power plants in Japan, enhancement measures of the management capacity, such as re-racking, have already been implemented by now where available. Since opportunities for further enhancement are narrow and scarce, implementation of AFR storage is justifiably needed in an appropriate time range. In fact, relevant institutional developments, namely policy formulation, such as statements in the Long-term Program of Research, Development and Utilization of Nuclear Energy, as well as legislation, especially the amendment of the Law for Regulation of Nuclear Reactors, Nuclear Facilities and Nuclear Materials, have already been completed and implemented. This clearly justifies the needs for the policy analyses in this dissertation, such as strategic planning of storage projects and their economic assessments. Chapter 2 also deals with the historical evolutionary patterns of spent nuclear fuel storage technologies. Various types of storage technique have been developed and are now available. Recently, new dry storage techniques, which are characterized as a combination of metal canisters and concrete blocks including concrete cask storage and <b>horizontal</b> <b>silo</b> storage, are receiving higher shares in the market. The analysis of the historical patterns of worldwide market penetration of various techniques, however, has found no clear sign of retirement of any technology from the global market, while each technique has comfortably found its own "niche" with its own strength and special features to form cohabitation of all. This may reflects the very characteristics of spent nuclear fuel storage market with limited number of projects for long lifetimes. This observation at this moment, meanwhile, does not rule out possibilities of different patterns of market evolution to take place in the future, since the world market will expand whilst choices of techniques will be put more on invisible hands of market economy. Chapter 3 presents the energy and nuclear fuel cycle modeling frameworks, with which the author attempts to describe optimal patterns of nuclear fuel cycle management in harmony with nuclear energy utilization pathways. Chapter 3 starts with the development of Fuel Cycle Optimization Model (FCOM) and extends to its integration with the LDNE 21 global energy model, in order to analyze spent nuclear fuel management in an overall framework of nuclear fuel cycle and the global energy system. FCOM solves a long range (90 years) cost minimization problem of the LWR (light water reactor) - FBR (fast breeder reactor) symbiotic system based on linear programming. The optimal solution provides a desirable evolutionary pattern of plutonium (Pu) economy with Pu supply from reprocessing of spent LWR fuel as its key parameter. FCOM's superb feature is, despite a compact model, to obtain an optimal solution of management of spent LWR fuel integrated with reactor mix patterns. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that spent LWR fuel storage is chosen to adjust future uncertainty as it gives flexibility to the whole nuclear fuel cycle to allow spent LWR fuel reprocessing according to Pu demand. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, while reprocessing of spent LWR fuel is undertaken in accordance with Pu demands, storage of spent LWR fuel provides the adjustment function between Pu supply and demand. This means that storage of spent nuclear fuel should be chosen actively as a measure to cope with uncertainty towards future as it gives flexibility to the management and operation of the whole nuclear fuel cycle. Chapter 3 further extends to the integration of FCOM with the long-range global energy model LDNE 21 (Linearlized Dynamic New Earth 21). In this application, FCOM serves as a nuclear energy sub-model within the LDNE 21 framework, which analyzes optimal global energy pathways in terms of minimum discounted total system costs up to the year 2100 under a certain set of global environmental and other constraints. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, under a constraint of atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to be kept below 550 ppm in the year 2100, the optimal global energy strategy will be chosen under competition between nuclear power generation and combined cycle generation by coal. This underscores the importance of nuclear fuel cycle and spent nuclear fuel management modeled in FCOM against global energy pictures. Meanwhile, necessity of global shift towards Pu economy does not necessarily maintain. Chaster 4 presents a theoretical analysis of optimal choice of storage duration. In this analysis, the fundamental roles and benefits of storage are understood as twofold; 1) postponement of subsequent processes, which leads to a decrease of present value of those costs, and 2) gains through R&D by earning time with storage. As the result, there could appear an optimal storage duration, which equalizes the following two indices; a) the incremental storage cost for 1 more year, in other words the marginal cost, and b) the increase of the sum of above mentioned benefits, or the marginal utility, through 1 year extension of storage. In the case of uncertainty, this optimal storage duration is prolonged accordingly through a risk-averse attitude. These findings stand also in the case of direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This analysis, however, omits certain factors such as specific lifetimes of storage containers and/or facilities, or societal anxieties, which may lead to additional costs when storage duration is prolonged. Chapter 5 deals with the methodologies of material balance calculation ranging discharge, storage, transportation and final processing of spent nuclear fuel. They are categorized into the following two kinds; 1) a microscopic accounting for each power station site or each power utility company, and 2) a macroscopic analysis, either simulation or optimization, in a region-wide or nationwide scale. In Chapter 5, development of a Japan-wide simulation tool SFTRACE (Spent Fuel Storage, TRAnsportation and Cost Evaluation System) is discussed. SFTRACE is mainly based on the 2 nd methodology while taking the 1 st microscopic accounting aspect fully into account. The illustrative simulation runs revealed various trade-off relations, such as the one between storage capacity to be installed and transportation requirements, the other among geographic coverage of AFR storage facilities as to whether to construct one to serve all over Japan or several to serve segmented regions. These trade-offs clearly demonstrate the necessity and usefulness of integrated analytic tools such as SFTRACE. Chapter 6 discusses the framework of economic analyses of spent nuclear fuel storage. Based on the methodological review of the following three categories, numerical applications are presented for each of them; 1) an engineering-economic cost calculation to assess levelized unit costs, 2) a total cost assessment with strategic planning, and 3) a project financing appraisal and storage price induction. Based on latest sets of data and information, the levelized unit storage costs lay in a reasonable range of 30 - 70 kJPY/kgU, which corresponds to 0. 07 - 0. 17 JPY/kWh at burnup of 49, 000 MWd/tU with no discounting applied between power generation and storage. With the strategic planning application, several key parameters are identified such as the geographic coverage of AFR centralized storage devices, economy of scale and others. Finally, the project financing appraisal method is applied to explore viable storage pricing schemes which maintain the project of 5, 000 MTU metal cask storage facility as healthy enough against financial criteria. Because of the highly investment intensive nature of the project, a combinatory pricing scheme of storage service is highly recommended with an initial payment upon receipt of spent nuclear fuel at the storage facility and annual fee payments per unit of spent nuclear fuel stored for each year of storage duration. As the conclusion of the analyses described in these Chapters, policy recommendations are presented in Chapter 7 for planning and implementation of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan. The demand of spent nuclear fuel storage will increase steadily and rapidly, to reach 7, 000 - 10, 000 MTU by the year 2020 to 2030. In 2050, uncertainties surrounding spent nuclear fuel management will also accumulate. In a most likely scenario, the storage demand will level off at around 10, 000 MTU after 2020 - 30 to 2050, which suggests storage capacity of 10, 000 MTU must be installed by the year 2020. As concerns to the storage duration as well as the long-term planning of spent nuclear fuel management, unless utility values of Pu uses will improve significantly, processes after storage should be planned with reference of lifetime expiration of the storage facility. 報告番号: 乙 15624; 学位授与年月日: 2003 - 03 - 12; 学位の種別: 論文博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 第 15624 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科システム量子工学専...|$|E

40|$|The {{dangers of}} {{functional}} organisation structures are well documented and {{have led to}} the advocation, particularly by exponents of BPR, of the process enterprise paradigm. This paper reports the results of case-study research that was conducted in order to explore the operational changes resulting from re-engineering companies along process, rather than functional lines. Increased market responsiveness, improved collaboration between functions and alignment of organisational objectives were some of the perceived benefits of the new process structures; but some disadvantages were also identified. Duplication of functional expertise and increased operational complexity resulted in an escalation of costs, the emergence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>silos,</b> inconsistency in the execution of functional decisions between processes, and general erosion of the efficiency of the operations network. These preliminary findings point to some possible contingencies of organisational design, suggesting that process structures may be conducive to the realisation of differentiation strategies, whilst functional structures may offer benefits to cost leaders. It is further proposed that matrix structures may be appropriate for companies adopting mixed strategies; however, it is envisaged that a more flexible approach to organisational design, based on a network rather than a matrix paradigm, could stimulate new developments in the future quest for strategic and structural alignment.

The aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of different plastic films in reducing the top losses in maize silage. The following treatments were evaluated: (i) coextruded polyethylene/polyamide oxygen barrier film (OB), (ii) polyethylene film (PE), (iii) polyvinyl chloride film (PVC), and (iv) coextruded PE/polyvinyl alcohol film (PVOH). These treatments differed according to oxygen permeability with values of 75, 722, 982 and 289 cm(3) m(- 2) per 24 hour respectively. OB and PVOH films had better temperature and fermentation profiles than the more permeable films. The OB film was effective in reducing the dry-matter (DM) losses during storage (82 g kg(- 1)), and the PVOH film had an intermediate value of DM loss (101 g kg(- 1)). PE and PVC films had higher losses (138 and 145 g kg(- 1) respectively). Oxygen permeability of the films promoted a positive correlation with DM losses (P < 0. 05; r 2 = 0. 945). The results indicate that O 2 permeability through the plastic film is a crucial factor for maintaining silage quality in the upper layer of the silo when it is perfectly sealed.

40|$|Dry {{matter and}} energy losses which occur from the faces of silage (1) prior to {{unloading}} from silos and (2) following unloading but prior to being consumed by livestock {{are referred to as}} after-fermentation. Silages with low rates of after-fermentation are said to be stable, and thus, have a relatively long bunk life. After-fermentation in silages is caused by aerobic organisms becoming active {{because of the presence of}} oxygen prior to or following unloading from silos. The aerobic organisms metabolize residual carbohydrates and lactic acid in silage and the heating of feeds after unloading is indication of activity of such organisms. In conventional tower silos, after-fermentation losses can occur from the face of the silage. In "sealed " or oxygen-limiting structures similar losses can occur in the unloading zone due to oxygen exposure during feeding periods. In <b>horizontal</b> <b>silos,</b> similar types of losses can occur from the face of the silo as well as the top surface if silos are not covered well. Research by Zimmer et ale (1973) indicated that after-fermentation losses were primarily but not exclusively related to yeast populations and activity. Their findings suggested that yeast populations increased in silage during periods of oxygen exposure with high population being related to greater exposure. Exposure to oxygen caused by slow filling rates and improper silo construction, maintenance or managementwould permit aerobic microbial populations to increase.

Nutrient composition, fermentation profile, and yeast and mold counts in edible silages were similar across treatments. Silage temperature during the storage period was 24. 6, 28. 7, 28. 4 and 33. 1 °C for RB+SB, OB+WB, WB and B, respectively, and the proportion of spoiled silage ranged from 28. 7 (for the RB+SB treatment) to 74. 2 g/kg DM (for the B treatment). Dry matter intake was similar across treatments and averaged 21. 9 kg/d. Milk production was higher for cows fed corn silage covered with RB+SB (34. 4 kg/d) compared with those fed corn silage covered with B (30. 4 kg/d), resulting in higher feed efficiency for RB+SB treatment.

40|$|High quality {{corn silage}} does not just “happen”, it is planned. As with any process, there are control points where an {{incorrect}} decision {{can reduce the}} quality and value of the final product. Conversely, correct decisions can help retain feed quality and aid in making more milk. Understanding and using these control points is what separates the best manag-ers from the rest. Therefore, these control points are worth a closer look. When to Harvest The first control point for corn silage production is the decision of when to begin harvest. Whole plant moisture content is the best harvest trigger to use because of its relation-ship with fermentation and digestibility (1). The trigger range suggested is 30 to 35 % whole plant dry matter for <b>horizontal</b> <b>silos</b> and 35 to 40 % for vertical silos. Length of Cut Once the {{decision has been made}} to begin the harvest, particle size of chop is the next critical control point. Par-ticle size affects the ability to pack the silage. Dry forages do not pack as tightly as wet, and the density or tightness of packing within the bunker affects the fermentation process in the silo. In more densely packed silage more oxygen is excluded, reducing the length of the respiration phase of the ensiling process. Reducing respiration decreases the poten-tial for heat-damaged proteins and loss of dry matter (DM). Well-packed corn silage also reduces the potential for mold growth because oxygen is limited. Finally, the more rapidly the silage moves from respiration to anaerobic fermentation, which pH drops and the “pickling ” of the silage takes place, fewer undesirable by-products will be produced. In the end, the by-products of this “pickling ” affect feed intake and digestibility. Therefore, particle size of corn silage ends up being very important. Traditionally, researchers make a recommendation con-cerning a theoretical length of cut (TLC) of about 3 / 8 inch (2) for corn silage that is 30 to 35 % DM and not processe...|$|R

In this paper, we present an experimental study of reduction of the clogging probability in a <b>horizontal</b> plane <b>silo,</b> which consists of a layer of elastic particles transported on an annular flat plate rotating with a constant angular velocity passing through a hopper structure. We found the exponential distributions of the avalanche size for different sizes of orifice and the power law tails of the passing time between two particles. We did not confirm {{whether there was a}} critical size of orifice above which the clogging became impossible. We explored the effect of the obstacle on the probability of clogging: and if we chose a proper obstacle placed at a proper position, the probability of clogging could be reduced by a factor of about seven...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} have vast applications both in industry and in daily life. They display quite interesting and exceptional properties {{different from the}} other known forms of matter. To investigate the complex properties of particulate materials, experimental, analytical and simulation techniques have been employed. In this paper the results of large-scale discrete element molecular dynamics (DEM) simulations in three dimensions are reported. It deals with the investigation of stress deflection due to various grain sizes. Moreover, the influence of coefficient of friction between granules and cylindrical walls on the mass measured at bottom of container i. e. apparent mass is thoroughly investigated. It is revealed that apparent mass varies linearly with the grain size. In addition to that, it is also found that the apparent mass variation is strongly dependent on bead diameter rather than the silo. The results reveal that conversion of vertical stresses into <b>horizontal</b> in <b>silo</b> is mainly due to the friction between the grain and system boundary...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{laboratory tests}} {{carried out in}} the steel flat-bottomed silo model filled with sand, subjected to external dynamic loads. The model was placed on a system of springs, which represent subsoil. The loads in the form of horizontal impulses were applied to the bottom plate of the <b>silo.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> pressure-time courses were used to analyze the influence of subsoil vibrations on the distribution changes of these pressures. Basic conclusion: (1) the subsoil vibrations cause two types of changes of the horizontal pressures: stable changes which are observed when the model vibrations finish and cyclic of short duration (brief) changes; (2) the subsoil vibrations either generate stable increase or stable decrease of the pressures from before vibrations or do not generate any essential stable change; (3) the cyclic dynamic changes of the horizontal pressures depend on the direction of the silo wall displacements and they are the function of the values of these displacements...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the horizontal pressures on a cylindrical metal silo of corrugated walls and flat bottom with 1. 82 m diameter and 5. 4 m high, and to compare the values with those obtained theoretically by the ISO 11697, EP 433 and AS 3774 standards. The silo was symmetrically filled and constant speed with wheat cv. soft red for two different height/diameter ratios (H/D) and was unloaded through three orifices with a diameter of 71. 6 mm, one concentric and two eccentrics. Horizontal pressures were measured {{on the walls of the}} silo at three positions using hydraulic type pressure cells. The results showed that shortly after the start of the unloading, there was a mass flow above the quota of H/D = 1. 2, whereas below this quota funnel flow occurred. It can be said that the EP 433 standard was more appropriate to predict <b>horizontal</b> pressures in <b>silos</b> in H/D ratio = 1. 0, with eccentric unloading. For the H/D ratio = 1. 5, AS 3774 standard was the one that produced values closer to the experimental...|$|R
40|$|Eco 2 Fume (2 % {{phosphine}} and 98 % CO 2 w/w) and Vaporph 3 OS ® (99. 3 % phosphine w/w) are cylinderised gas {{formulation of}} phosphine which are commercially used for safe, effective and user-friendly fumigation {{of food and}} non-food commodities. In, response to the increasing global concern on safety and environment, new applications had been developed to expand {{the use of these}} two phosphine fumigants. As an alternative to methyl bromide, new fumigation protocols for Eco 2 Fume and Vaporph 3 OS ® to kill all stages of insects were established and approved in the USA which allows a shorter fumigation time of 24 hrs at 500 - 1, 000 ppm phosphine concentration and 27 °C or higher temperatures. In Australia, a new fumigation protocol was approved which can completely kill all stages of insects in 3 - 24 days at 70 – 700 ppm phosphine concentration and 15 -> 30 °C temperature. Trials conducted on the fruit fumigation showed that cylinderised phosphine can effectively kill all stages of insects using 1400 ppm at 0 - 6 °C in 48 – 72 hours and a residue level below the maximum residue limit of 0. 01 mg/kg. For treatment of exported cut flower and foliage in New Zealand, a shorter fumigation time of 4 hours is in commercial use with Eco 2 Fume under vacuum condition. Promising results are also shown in the trials conducted on timber and log fumigation. Techniques have been developed for the application of Vaporph 3 OS ® in combination with the Horn Diluphos System for fumigation of cereal grain and oil seeds in sealed <b>silos,</b> <b>horizontal</b> sheds and bunkers with capacities ranging from 1000 – 300, 000 tonnes.
