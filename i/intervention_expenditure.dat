Die Untersuchung von 6. 459 Fällen eines Berliner Geriatrie-Fachkrankenhauses (Vollerhebung), analysiert die mit Sozialdienstprozeduren erfassten Leistungen (SozOPS-G©) der Jahrgänge 2004, 2005 (Analysestichprobe) und 2006 (Validierungsstichprobe). Als dichotomisierte Indikatorvariablen in Faktorenanalysen eingegangene 37 Einzelleistungen führen zur Verdichtung auf ein Drittel reliabel zusammenfassbarer Module. Die Stichproben bringen 13 Faktoren hervor, die zusammen 65 - 66 % der Gesamtvarianz Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit abbilden. Multiple Regressionsanalysen zeigen, dass sich 43 % der Varianz zeitlicher Inanspruchnahme von Sozialdienstleistungen Patientenmerkmalen zuordnen lassen. Der standardisierte Regressionskoeffizient indiziert, dass Variablen des administrativen Verlaufs die stärksten Effekte aufweisen. Prognostisch bedeutsam sind poststationär institutionalisierte Langzeitversorgung (mittlerer Zusatzaufwand ca. 1 Stunde) und Verweildauer (ca. 2 Minuten pro Tag). Demenz beansprucht durchschnittlich einen Mehraufwand von ca. 13 Minuten. 43 % der Varianz des Sozialdienst-Aufwandes können durch 10 - 12 Einflussgrößen erklärt werden (R 2 = 0, 434; F= 119, 597; df= 24 / 3739; p< 0, 001). Einzelleistungen Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit lassen sich bei sachlogischer Zusammenführung zu kohärenten Leistungsbausteinen kombinieren und können stabil gemessen werden (Faktorenanalyse). Die Inanspruchnahme sozialdienstlicher Leistungen läßt sich auf spezifische Patientenmerkmale zurückführen (Regressionsanalyse). Die abrechnungsrelevante Berücksichtigung der interaktionsintensiven Fachberatungs- und Interventionsleistungen Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit im DRG-System ist grundsätzlich möglich. Established in Germany's {{hospitals}} in 2004, Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) {{are said to}} be operated by "money follows case-related performance". Comprehensive Geriatric Treatment (procedure code "OPS 8 - 550 ") requires a variety of interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach combines treatment and rehabilitation as a holistic intervention. Since psychosocial issues are as relevant as functional decline or physical limitations, social workers are integrated in the Geriatric Assessment Team. However, their work of providing support to frail elders and the chronically ill is not yet figured in the cost containment system. In this study, all procedural tasks that deal with the complexity of discharge planning processes were categorized and outlined in a newly developed instrument that includes time exposure. Based on the "Procedure Codes of Hospital Social Work" (clinical information system embedded "SozOPS-G©") inpatients of a German hospital for Geriatrics (N= 6459) were statistically evaluated. Multiple regression and factor analyses were used to test the instrument's reliability and predictive value for social workers' expenditure of time. Morbidity, post-hospital care (e. g. home health care, short- or long-term care facilities, hospice services), length of stay and treatment procedure were consistently identified as significant predictors of psychosocial <b>intervention</b> <b>expenditure</b> (R 2 = 0. 434; F= 119, 597; df= 24 / 3739; p<. 001). A factor analysis revealed that a total of 37 procedural tasks could be reliably reduced to 13 aggregated factors covering 65 % of total variance. In conclusion, the diversity and complexity of effective social work services can be reliably formalized, aggregated and quantified to fit the needs of DRG-based funding...|$|E

40|$|The {{national}} {{employment services}} {{have become a}} central point {{in the struggle against}} unemployment in the most countries. In Serbia, National Employment Service is under direct administration of the government, especially in the scope of labour market policy. The government is unable to carry out its policy without reliably information which is generated by the solid labour market policy database. The specific objective of this paper is the analysis of labour market policy database in Serbia and comparison with Eurostat database and methodology. Labour market policy databases in different countries have the structure based on unique methodology. Despite that, most common structure involves labour market policy register, as first section, register of participants, as second section and register of expenditures, as third. For {{the purpose of this paper}} we conducted the brief analysis of overall information system in National Employment Service in Serbia and detailed analysis of database sections including input variables and the ability of generating different reports. The prior research in this area was conducted in the first half of 2011, as a part of the EUNES IPA programme “Technical assistance for capacity building of the National Employment Services – Republic of Serbia for data management, forecasts, monitoring and evaluation”. Bearing in mind the conclusions in the previous research and findings of our analysis we found that there is no significant differences between scope of database, classification of <b>interventions,</b> <b>expenditures</b> and participants in the structure of database in Serbia in comparison with Eurostat methodology. We also find that the main problem in the matching in database is the differences between profession title list and job title list...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze the {{determinants}} of State intervention upon {{the social and economic}} life, and to grasp their implications in terms of public policy. The problem of State interventionism is a current one, and over time it has been under the influence of certain factors such as interstate differences, economic and social crises, political governance of the country, regional policy and globalization. The challenges that the current economic crisis brings in terms of State interventionism, are also presented. Some indicators that quantify the extent of State <b>intervention</b> through public <b>expenditures</b> are analyzed for the EU member countries (1995 - 2010) in order to capture the general trends in their evolution and the peculiarities of their structure. The empirical analysis, based on a panel econometric model, aims to establish the relevance held by the main determinants for the degree of State <b>intervention</b> in budgetary <b>expenditure,</b> for the EU countries. The possibilities for an increasing State interference during the crisis, related with the withdrawal of the State once the crisis would be overcome, are valued with reference to the significant determinants of the interference policy derived from empirical analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the background and limitations of maternity care policy and provision in Australia using the Boundary Critique method from critical systems thinking. We argue that the historical legacy of funding maternity care within medically dominated fee-for-service structures and acute hospital budgets is seriously flawed. Furthermore, it cannot deliver the policy goals of healthy and socially equitable birth practices. Despite the 2009 national Maternity Services Review and progress of a National Maternity Services Plan (2011), most mainstream Australian maternity services remain out-of-step with both health service research and evidence-based ‘best practice’. The present system drives unnecessary clinical <b>interventions,</b> increased <b>expenditure,</b> short-term adverse health outcomes {{and the potential for}} a larger, unacknowledged legacy of future chronic disease.

This paper highlights the major issues in agriculture, examines the MNAAP agenda on productivity and identify the remaining gaps. The paper shows how government policy and institutional interventions have contributed to the erosion of the country's competitive advantage and hence to the poor performance of the agricultural sector since the 1980 's. These interventions include the price and market policy interventions, policies on property rights and the public expenditure allocations which have hindered the achievement of a higher productivity in the sector. The examination of the MNAAP 2000 - 2004 goals, strategies, and activities shows that as government draws a map for agriculture {{productivity growth}}, no clear steps and actions are geared towards addressing the major policy constraints besetting the sector which can be considered as a prerequisite to attainment of productivity growth. property rights, agricultural productivity, market policy <b>intervention,</b> public <b>expenditure</b> allocation...|$|R

We surveyed residents from 40 households in a high-risk community at the urban periphery in the city of Machala, Ecuador, on dengue perceptions, vector control <b>interventions,</b> household <b>expenditures,</b> and factors influencing purchasing decisions. The results of this study show that households spend a monthly median of US$ 2. 00, or 1. 90 % (range: 0. 00 %, 9. 21 %) of their family income on Ae. aegypti control interventions. Households reported employing, on average, five different mosquito control and dengue prevention interventions, including aerosols, liquid sprays, repellents, mosquito coils, and unimpregnated bed nets. We found that effectiveness and cost were the most important factors that influence people’s decisions to purchase a mosquito control product.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to analyse fiscal {{policies of the}} Belgian Regions and Communities in the last regional legislature, drawing attention to their scope for action, their priorities {{in the provision of}} public goods and the policy evaluation. In Belgium, Regions and Communities have a high fiscal and political autonomy, or ?spending power?, so that they can apply their own reforms. On the last legislature, evolution of their revenue allowed to increase their expenditure more than the real trend growth, even by performing the States fiscal targets on the period 2005 - 2008. Public expenditures particularly increased in the Flemish Community and the Brussels Region. However, through equalisation mechanisms (National solidarity <b>intervention),</b> public <b>expenditures</b> per capita are distributed more equally than the income, and even in favour of poorer regions. Belgian Regions and Communities also make differential choices in the allocation of public goods. According to a comparison of the States budgets, Flemish States give greater place to education, health and social protection. Although some signs of convergence appeared during the period 2004 and 2008, the French-speaking States and the Brussels Region still spend more in economic affairs, employment and professional training. The long-lasting interregional economic disparities challenge the effectiveness of such expenditures. Therefore, policy and performance evaluation appear as a decisive stage to promote efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures. In this area, the monitoring of the Marshall Plan is rather a promising initiative. JEL Codes ?

The theoretical framework {{is based on a}} functional approach in compliance to the International Classification of Function and Disability (ICF). Chapter 2 {{addresses the}} relationship between motor performance in the aquatic environment setting as measured by the Aquatic Independence Measure (AIM) to motor performance on land as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) in a sample of 49 children with neuro-motor impairments. Significant relations were found between the total AIM and GMFM scores and PEDI self-care domains. Chapter 3 reviews aquatic intervention research in children with neuro-motor deficiencies aiming to evaluate research reported in relation to the ICF terminology (changes in body function, activity level and participation). Eleven of the 173 articles retrieved met the inclusion criteria. According to this review, there is a substantial lack of evidence - based research evaluating the specific effects of aquatic interventions in this population. Chapter 4 compares the effects of a four-month aquatic to land based <b>intervention</b> on energy <b>expenditure</b> and gross motor function in 17 children with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy (CP). Nine children (5. 3 yr + 1. 02) received aquatic and eight children (4. 7 yr +. 95) exercise <b>intervention.</b> Energy <b>expenditure</b> was measured by expired gas by means of Cosmed K 4 b 2 metabolic system and the energy expenditure index based on heart rate measures. Self- paced and fast walking velocity were measured by the 10 meter walk. Gross motor performance was measured by the GMFM and PEDI. No differences were found between groups in energy expenditure measures. However, group effect sizes and mean trends suggested a more favorable decrease in energy expenditure in the aquatic intervention group in comparison to the exercise intervention group. Effect sizes of the ten meter walk were larger in the exercise group in comparison to the aquatic intervention group. Significant differences were found in the PEDI self care domain in favor of the aquatic intervention group. Based on this study it is recommended to combine both means of interventions to increase functional levels of motor performance in this population. Chapter 5 addresses the effects of a four-months aquatic compared to an exercise land based intervention on perceived competence and social acceptance in 22 children with spastic diplegia CP. Twelve children (5. 4 yr +. 95) received aquatic and ten children (5. 4 yr +. 95) exercise intervention. Perceived competence was measured by means of the physical and social sub-scales of the Pictorial scale for Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance (PSPCSA-CP). Social function was measured by means of the PEDI social function domain.

In recent years, many governments have adopted reference pricing either as a replacement or in addition to product specific price controls.

This article provides a review of reference pricing in Europe, North America and other countries. There are many similarities in the reference price policies but the markets to which they apply {{are more likely to be}} different. The European experience gives a `once-for-all' lowering effect on pharmaceutical expenditure, often at the expense of compromises on prescribing. In Germany and The Netherlands, reference pricing has been relatively ineffective in lowering expenditure which has led to a succession of other <b>interventions</b> to achieve <b>expenditure</b> control goals. The US also has reference pricing, but it occurs in a very competitive market which may be responsible (at least in part) for the relatively modest growth in expenditure compared with European countries.

Nonetheless, governments continue to pursue reference pricing strategies. Reviews-on-treatment, Health-policy, Reimbursement, Health-economics, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{contributes}} to the economics literature by providing a theoretical and empirical investigation {{of the effects of}} changes in the relative size of government on Australian economic performance. The theoretical literature indicates that an expansion in government size is likely to induce adverse effects upon economic growth for a host of reasons. These include the distortionary effects of taxation imposed to finance government expenditures, the displacement effects of private sector economic activity attributable to public sector interventions, and the growth in governmental activity encouraging economic participants to divert their attentions away from direct market activities and towards seeking benefits through the political process. The historical experience suggests that all levels of Australian governments have grown in terms of size and scope of functions and activities undertaken, and that this growth has transpired over a broad range of public policy <b>interventions</b> including <b>expenditure,</b> taxation and revenue raising and regulation. An assessment of various statistical measurements of public sector size tends to confirm the general proposition that the public sector in Australia has grown over the long run. This thesis analyses the effect of government size on economic performance in Australia using annual time series data for the period 1960 to 2010. The hypothesis that an increase in the relative size of government leads to a lower per capita economic growth rate is tested using a variety of econometric specifications, including multivariate ordinary least squares and simultaneous equation techniques. The empirical results suggest an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a lower annual GDP per capita growth rate of between 1. 2 and 2. 5 percentage points. This study also reveals the empirical significance of various underlying determinants of public sector growth to overall government size. The increase in public sector service costs relative to the private sector, the greater ease of tax collection attributable to rising female labour market participation, and increasing government expenditures provided as insurance for the effects of economic openness are found to exert significant effects upon growth in public sector size. However, the empirical results indicate that ‘Wagner’s law’ of increasing government expenditure arising from general economic development does not hold for Australia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The elderly {{population}} consumes {{a large share}} of medical resources in the western world. A significant portion of the expense is related to hospitalizations. Objectives To evaluate an intervention program designed {{to reduce the number of}} hospitalization of elderly patients by a more optimal allocation of resources in primary care. Methods A multidimensional intervention program was conducted that included the re-engineering of existing work processes with a focus on the management of patient problems, improving communication with outside agencies, and the establishment of a system to monitor quality of healthcare parameters. Data on the number of hospitalizations and their cost were compared before and after implementation of the intervention program. Results As a result of the <b>intervention</b> the mean <b>expenditure</b> per elderly patient was reduced by 22. 5 %. The adjusted number of hospitalizations/ 1, 000 declined from 15. 1 to 10. 7 (29. 3 %). The number of adjusted hospitalization days dropped from 132 to 82 (37. 9 %) and the mean hospitalization stay declined from 8. 2 to 6. 7 days (17. 9 %). The adjusted hospitalization cost ($/ 1, 000 patients) dropped from $ 32, 574 to $ 18, 624 (42. 8 %). The overall clinic expense, for all age groups, dropped by 9. 9 %. Conclusion Implementation of the intervention program in a single primary care clinic led to a reduction in hospitalizations for the elderly patient population and to a more optimal allocation of healthcare resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} ability of the SenseWear Pro 2 Armband (SWA) to {{accurately}} assess energy expenditure in free-living overweight or obese children during a two-week period, by comparison with energy expenditure measured using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method. A second aim was to examine which software version, Innerview Professional 5. 1 or Sensewear Professional 6. 0, are the most appropriate for use together with SWA in overweight and obese children. Method: A random sample of 22 healthy, overweight or obese children (11 girls and 11 boys) aged 8 - 11 years was recruited from an ongoing <b>intervention</b> study. Energy <b>expenditure</b> in free-living conditions was simultaneously assessed with the SWA and DLW methods during a 14 -day period. All data from the SWA were analyzed using InnerView Professional software versions 5. 1 (SWA 5. 1) and 6. 1 (SWA 6. 1). Results: An accurate estimation in energy expenditure was obtained when SWA 5. 1 was used, showing a non-statistically significant difference corresponding to 17 (1200) kJ[middle dot]d- 1 compared with the energy expenditure measured using the DLW method. However, when SWA 6. 1 was used a statistically significant (18 %) underestimation of energy expenditure was obtained, corresponding to 1962 (1034) kJ[middle dot]d- 1 compared with the DLW method. Conclusion: The SWA together with software version 5. 1, but not 6. 1, is a valid method for accurately measuring energy expenditure at group level of free-living overweight and obese children...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{administration}} of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) has been recommended for specific {{patients in the}} intensive care unit (ICU) setting, this practice has been extrapolated to care of non-ICU patients without evidence to support need or efficacy. AIMS: To examine the practice of SUP in non-ICU patients in a university hospital setting, with specific attention to resource utilization. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of adult non-ICU admissions to one family medicine and five general internal medicine teaching services over a consecutive 4 -month period. Proportion of patients prescribed SUP was ascertained after exclusion of patients admitted on antisecretory therapy (AST) or prescribed AST for non-SUP indications. Annual cost estimates were calculated assuming full compliance. RESULTS: Of 1, 769 patient admissions, 22 % received SUP and 54 % of these were discharged home on AST. None of these patients met evidence-based criteria for appropriate SUP. Inpatient SUP cost $ 11, 024 over the 4 months of the study ($ 44, 096 annually), and outpatient costs based on discharge prescriptions were $ 16, 924 ($ 67, 695 annually), yielding a total cost expenditure of $ 27, 948 ($ 111, 791 annually). CONCLUSION: SUP is overutilized in the non-ICU setting, and patients are often discharged unnecessarily on AST, resulting in significant cost <b>expenditure.</b> <b>Interventions</b> to ensure appropriate use of SUP should decrease resource expenditures without detrimental impact on quality of care.

40|$|There {{are various}} {{strategies}} {{to improve the}} effectiveness of antibiotics in hospitals. In general, the implementation of guidelines for appropriate antibiotic therapy and the participation of infectious disease (ID) physicians deserve considerable attention. This study was a prospective ecological time-series study that evaluates {{the effectiveness of the}} ID physician's opinion to rationalize and control the use of antibiotics in medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU), and the impact of their <b>intervention</b> on treatment <b>expenditures.</b> There was significant change in the pattern of use of antimicrobials, this pattern approximating that of a medical-surgical ICU that participates in the ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology) Project. For example, there was {{a significant increase in the}} consumption of antimicrobials of the ampicillin group (Relative Risk [RR]= 3. 39; 95 % CI: 2. 34 - 4. 91) and antipseudomonal penicillins (RR= 2. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 70 - 4. 92). On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of 3 rd/ 4 th generation cephalosporins (RR= 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 77) and carbapenems (RR= 0. 43; 95 % CI: 0. 33 - 0. 56). On average, for every patient-day antibiotic expense was reduced 37. 2 % during calendar year 2001, when compared with 2000. The ID specialists' opinion and the adoption of guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy of hospital-acquired pneumonia contributed to a reduction in the use of antimicrobials in medical-surgical ICU. However, further studies that have more control over confounding variables are needed to help determine the relevance of these discoveries...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Carnosine is a {{naturally}} present dipeptide abundant in skeletal muscle and an over-the counter food additive. Animal data suggest a role of carnosine supplementation {{in the prevention}} and treatment of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease but only limited human data exists. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of vastus lateralis muscle were obtained by needle biopsy. We measured muscle carnosine levels (high-performance liquid chromatography), % body fat (bioimpedance), abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging), insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), resting energy expenditure (REE, indirect calorimetry), free-living ambulatory physical activity (accelerometers) and lipid profile in 36 sedentary non-vegetarian middle aged men (45 ± 7 years) {{with varying degrees of}} adiposity and glucose tolerance. Muscle carnosine content was positively related to % body fat (r = 0. 35, p = 0. 04) and subcutaneous (r = 0. 38, p = 0. 02) but not visceral fat (r = 0. 17, p = 0. 33). Muscle carnosine content was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity (r = - 0. 44, p = 0. 008), REE (r = - 0. 58, p< 0. 001) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r = - 0. 34, p = 0. 048). Insulin sensitivity and physical activity were the best predictors of muscle carnosine content after adjustment for adiposity. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that higher carnosine content in human skeletal muscle is positively associated with insulin resistance and fasting metabolic preference for glucose. Moreover, it is negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol and basal energy <b>expenditure.</b> <b>Intervention</b> studies targeting insulin resistance, metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factors are necessary to evaluate its putative role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{reported}} longitudinal relationships between physical activity (PA) and cardiometabolic risk factors over time using repeated assessments in overweight or obese adults. We conducted a longitudinal study in 127 participants (81 % with body mass index > 30 kg/m 2) who completed a 12 -month behavioral intervention for weight loss between 2003 and 2005 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Using absolute change scores from baseline to each time point (i. e., 6 and 12 months) for all studied variables (Δ = time point - baseline), we performed mixed effects modeling to examine relationships between PA and cardiometabolic risk factors, after adjusting for body weight, energy intake and other covariates (i. e., age, gender, and ethnicity). PA was assessed as energy expenditure (kcal/week) using the Paffenbarger activity questionnaire. Over the 12 -month period, energy expenditure increased (Δ 1, 370 kcal/week at 6 months vs. Δ 886 kcal/week at 12 months); body weight decreased (Δ 8. 9 kg at 6 months vs. Δ 8. 4 kg at 12 months). The average increase in energy expenditure over 12 months was significantly and independently related to reductions in total cholesterol (F = 6. 25, p = 0. 013), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (F = 5. 08, p = 0. 025) and fasting blood glucose (F = 5. 10, p = 0. 025), but not to other risk factors (i. e., fasting insulin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and waist circumference). In conclusion, among overweight and obese adults undergoing a weight loss <b>intervention,</b> increased energy <b>expenditure</b> over 12 months may improve total cholesterol and LDL-C, important coronary risk factors, and fasting blood glucose, a metabolic risk factor. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
