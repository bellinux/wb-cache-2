5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

30|$|The {{experiment}} utilized a 2 (teacher {{gesture to}} graphs: yes or no)[*]×[*] 2 (teacher gesture to equations: yes or no) design which yielded four lesson conditions: no gesture, gesture to equations only, gesture to graphs only, or gesture to both equations and graphs. In {{all of the}} conditions, <b>the</b> teacher <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> visual representations when she mentioned them; her gaze was scripted and did not vary across conditions. In the no-gesture condition, the teacher did not produce any hand gestures <b>to</b> <b>the</b> visual representations; however, she did <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> graphs and equations when she spoke about them. In the gesture-to-graphs-only condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> graphs when she mentioned them during the lesson, {{but she did not}} point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> graphs, but only <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> equations. In the gesture-to-equations-only condition, <b>the</b> teacher gestured <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> equations when she mentioned them during the lesson, but did not point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graphs. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> equations, but only <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of <b>the</b> graphs. In the gesture-to-both-graphs-and-equations condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> <b>to</b> elements of both the graphs and the equations during the lesson when she mentioned them.|$|R
25|$|In {{all three}} works of The Russian Series {{the details are}} located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the “sandy color, that of soil” is left intact, {{interrupted}} in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning his <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green enamel paint.|$|E

40|$|Aberrant eye gaze {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies of eye movements in children with ASD reveal diminished eye gaze duration and lack of specific eye <b>gaze</b> fixation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eyes and/or mouth compared with controls. However, findings to date have been contradictory. We examined eye-tracking studies on face processing in children with ASD and conducted meta-analyses to examine whether these children demonstrate atypical fixation on primary facial regions. Twenty eye-tracking studies in children with ASD were reviewed, of which the results from 14 studies were incorporated in the meta-analyses that evaluated fixation duration on (i) eyes (eight studies) and (ii) mouth (six studies). The results reveal that children with ASD have significantly reduced <b>gaze</b> fixation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eye region of faces. The results of the meta-analyses indicate that ASD patients have significant impairments in <b>gaze</b> fixation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eyes. On the other hand, no significant difference was uncovered in terms of fixation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth region; however, this finding needs to {{be interpreted with caution}} because of the significant heterogeneity in the mouth fixation studies. The findings of this meta-analysis add further clarity to an expanding literature and suggest that specific eye <b>gaze</b> fixation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eye region may represent a robust biomarker for the condition. The heterogeneity associated with the mouth fixation data precludes any definitive statement as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> robustness of these findings. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies had}} shown that {{speakers}} naming several objects typically look at each object until they have retrieved the phonological form of its name and therefore look longer at objects with long names than at objects with shorter names. We examined whether this tight eye-to-speech coordination was maintained at different speech rates and after increasing amounts of practice. Participants named {{the same set of}} objects with monosyllabic or disyllabic names on up to 20 successive trials. In Experiment 1, they spoke as fast as they could, whereas in Experiment 2 they had to maintain a fixed moderate or faster speech rate. In both experiments, the durations of <b>the</b> <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> objects decreased with increasing speech rate, indicating that at higher speech rates, the speakers spent less time planning the object names. The eye-speech lag (the time interval between the shift of gaze away from an object and the onset of its name) was independent of the speech rate but became shorter with increasing practice. Consistent word length effects on the durations of <b>the</b> <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> objects and the eye speech lags were only found in Experiment 2. The results indicate that shifts of eye gaze are often linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> completion of phonological encoding, but that speakers can deviate from this default coordination of eye gaze and speech, for instance when the descriptive task is easy and they aim to speak fast...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{detection}} of a lateralized visual target is faster when {{preceded by a}} face <b>gazing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of this stimulus. Here we aimed <b>to</b> clarify <b>the</b> time-course of the visual processing modulated by these reflexive shifts of attention. METHODS: ERPs were measured on 16 subjects performing a speeded location task on a circular checkerboard. The checkerboard target appeared either on {{the left or right}} of the upper or lower visual field, and was preceded by a central face orienting its <b>gaze</b> obliquely <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> four possible corner locations for <b>the</b> target <b>to</b> appear. RESULTS: Congruently cued targets were located faster than incongruently cued targets and were associated with larger and earlier occipital P 1 (approximately 110 ms) and occipito-parieto-temporal N 1 (approximately 150 ms) components. However, no such attentional modulations were found on the earlier C 1 visual component, best observed with a negative polarity for upper visual field stimulations, and thought to originate largely from primary visual cortex. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: These results show that reflexive shifts of attention following oblique eye <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> upper and lower visual fields increase and speed up the processing of visual information beyond the feedforward flow of information in primary visual cortex...|$|R
