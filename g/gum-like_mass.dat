40|$|Objectives : This {{study was}} {{performed}} to developing orally administered analgesics and locally injected pharmacopuncture analgesics like opioids. Methods : Literary investigation {{on the origin of}} poppy (Papaver somniferum L) and other narcotics was conducted to examine the potential of developing orally administered analgesics and locally injected pharmacopuncture analgesics. Opium is a <b>gum-like</b> <b>mass</b> derived from air-dried white fluid of immature fruit of the poppy. Opium contains approximately 20 types of alkaloids including morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine and others. Natural opioids and synthetic alkaloid derivatives are the constituents of opioid analgesics and their effects and side-effects depend on the peculiarities of receptors. An extreme caution is required in the selection of proper dosage, proper analgesic types, and indications for successful pain management. Results and Discussion : With the enactment of "Narcotic control protocol", herbs such as cannibis and poppy are no longer available for use by Korean medicine doctors, and these doctors are faced with difficulty in managing severe pain in the clinical environment. A systematic consideration is inevitable for overcoming the limitation on these analgesics...|$|E
40|$|The {{exudation}} of <b>gum-like</b> bacterial <b>masses</b> from diseased regions is {{a frequent}} feature of fireblight [Erwinia arnylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al. ] and other bacterial plant diseases. Exudate usually appears on the plant surface as small globules, a spreading film, or occa-sionally as fine aerial strands (Eden-Green & Billing, 1972; Billing & Eden-Green, 1973) and may provide a source of inoculum when transported by wind or wind-blown rain. Emergence of exudate follows the development of extensive internal bacterial populations, sometimes before other disease symptoms (wilt or necrosis) appear (Gowda & Goodman, 1970). Since bacteria account for only about 20 % of the dry weight of exudate removed from plant surfaces, analysis of the substantial non-bacterial moiety is of interest {{in view of the}} physical properties involved in the formation of aerial strands and its possible role in disease physiology. METHODS Potted apple, pear and hawthorn plants were inoculated with Erwina amylovora by needle puncture of the stem below the tip of a growing shoot, or by cutting off the apices of recently unfolded leaves with scissors dipped in inoculum (Eden-Green, 1972). Exudate from a par...|$|R
