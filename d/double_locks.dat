25|$|In May 1864, {{those who}} tended these <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> wanted higher pay for them, but were unsuccessful. As a result, {{one of the}} lockkeepers, S. C. Rogers, {{abandoned}} his post (Locks 45 – 46) in protest, {{and was replaced by}} Obadiah Barger. Later in November 1864, Obadiah complained that he had been removed as locktender of the same locks (45-46) without just cause, and the locktender Susan Newcomer was never present but hired a youth without approval of the company, to tend the locks. After an investigation showed it to be true, she was sacked and Obadiah was reinstated as locktender again.|$|E
500|$|The {{trustees}} {{investigated the}} idea of a junction canal from Winsford to the Middlewich branch of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal in 1830, but felt that water supply would be a problem. New cuts were constructed at Barnton, Crowton and Aston Grange between 1832 and 1835, and they then planned to construct a second lock beside each of the original locks. William Cubbitt was asked for advice on whether the river could be adapted for seagoing ships, and although he said it could, he did not think it would be cost effective. Work was then started on making the river [...] deep throughout, and building <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> suitable for 100-ton vessels which were [...] By 1845, Winnington, Acton and Hunts locks had been improved. Trade was good, with tolls generating £38,363 in 1845 from the carriage of 778,715 tons of goods. All of the improvements had been funded from the toll revenue, and over £500,000 had been given to the County of Cheshire, in line with the original Act.|$|E

Also, [...] "double lock" [...] (less often, [...] "twin lock") is often used by novices on the English canals to mean a wide (14ft) lock, presumably because it is [...] "double" [...] {{the width of a}} narrow lock, and allows two narrow boats going in the same direction to [...] "double up". These are properly known as broad locks.|$|E

2500|$|Locks {{can be built}} {{side by side on}} {{the same}} waterway. This is {{variously}} called doubling, pairing, or twinning. The Panama Canal has three sets of <b>double</b> <b>locks.</b> Doubling gives advantages in speed, avoiding hold-ups at busy times and increasing the chance of a boat finding a lock set in its favour. There can also be water savings: the locks may be of different sizes, so that a small boat does not need to empty a large lock; or each lock may be able to act as a side pond (water-saving basin) for the other. In this latter case, the word used is usually [...] "twinned": here indicating the possibility of saving water by synchronising the operation of the chambers so that some water from the emptying chamber helps to fill the other. This facility has long been withdrawn on the English canals, although the disused paddle gear can sometimes be seen, as at Hillmorton on the Oxford Canal. Elsewhere they are still in use; a pair of twinned locks has been opened in 2014 on the Dortmund-Ems Canal near Münster, Germany.|$|E
