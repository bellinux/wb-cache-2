But its {{establishment}} is accompanied by proofs that it occurs in different degrees and modes in different gases. Hence then another specific action, added to the many (1296. 1398. 1399. 1423. 1454. 1503.) by which the electrical relations of insulating dielectrics are distinguished and established, and another argument in favour of that molecular theory of induction, which is at present under examination[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1463. In all the gases, the {{different}} forms of disruptive discharge may be linked together and gradually traced from one extreme to the other, i.e. from the spark to the glow (1405. 1526.), or, it may be, to a still further condition to be called <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> (1544-1560.); but it is, nevertheless, very surprising {{to see what a}} specific character each keeps whilst under the predominance of the general law. Thus, in muriatic acid, the brush is very difficult to obtain, and there comes in its place almost a <b>dark</b> <b>discharge,</b> partaking of the readiness of the spark action. Moreover, in muriatic acid, I have never observed the spark with any dark interval in it. In nitrogen, the spark readily changes its character into that of brush. In carbonic acid gas, {{there seems to be a}} facility to occasion spark discharge, whilst yet that gas is unlike nitrogen in the facility of the latter to form brushes, and unlike muriatic acid in its own facility to continue the spark. These differences add further force, first to the observations already made respecting the spark in various gases (1422. 1423.), and then, to the proofs deducible from it, of the relation of the electrical forces to the particles of matter.|$|E
6000|$|... 1550. But {{in other}} cases, the {{phenomena}} are such {{as to make}} it almost certain, that <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> can take place across air. If the rounded end of a metal rod, 0.15 of an inch in diameter, be made to give a good negative brush, the approach of a smaller end or a blunt point opposite to it will, at a certain distance, cause a diminution of the brush, and a glow {{will appear on the}} positive inducteous wire, accompanied by a current of air passing from it. Now, as the air is being charged both at the positive and negative surfaces, it seems a reasonable conclusion, that the charged portions meet somewhere in the interval, and there discharge to each other, without producing any luminous phenomena. It is possible, however, that the air electrified positively at the glowing end may travel on towards the negative surface, and actually form that atmosphere into which the visible negative brushes dart, in which case <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> need not, of necessity, occur. But I incline to the former opinion, and think, that the diminution in size of the negative brush, as the positive glow comes on {{to the end of the}} opposed wire, is in favour of that view.|$|E
6000|$|... 1552. Hence I {{conclude}} that <b>dark</b> disruptive <b>discharge</b> may occur (1547. 1550.); and also, that, in the luminous brush, the visible ramifications may not show {{the full extent}} of the disruptive discharge (1444. 1452.), but that each may have a dark outside, enveloping, as it were, every part through which the discharge extends. It is probable, even, that there are such things as <b>dark</b> <b>discharges</b> analogous in form to the brush and the spark, but not luminous in any part (1445.).|$|R
6000|$|... 1551. Using {{rarefied}} air as the dielectric, it is {{very easy}} to obtain luminous phenomena as brushes, or glow, upon both conducting balls or terminations, whilst the interval is dark, and that, when the action is so momentary that I think we cannot consider currents as effecting <b>discharge</b> across the <b>dark</b> part. Thus if two balls, about an inch in diameter, and 4 or more inches apart, have the air rarefied about them, and are then interposed in the course of discharge, an interrupted or spark current being produced at the machine[A], each termination may be made to show luminous phenomena, whilst more or less of the interval is quite <b>dark.</b> The <b>discharge</b> will pass as suddenly as a retarded spark (295. 334.), i.e. in an interval of time almost inappreciably small, and in such a case, I think it must have passed across the dark part as true disruptive discharge, and not by convection.|$|R

6000|$|... 1548. The <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> {{through air}} (1552.), {{which in the}} case {{mentioned}} is very evident (1544.), leads to the inquiry, whether the particles of air are generally capable of effecting discharge {{from one to another}} without becoming luminous; and the inquiry is important, because it is connected with that degree of tension which is necessary to originate discharge (1368. 1370.). Discharge between air and conductors without luminous appearances are very common; and non-luminous discharges by carrying currents of air and other fluids (1562. 1595.) are also common enough: but these are not cases in point, for they are not discharges between insulating particles.|$|E
6000|$|... 1553. The {{occurrence}} of <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> {{in any case}} shows at how low a tension disruptive discharge may occur (1548,), and indicates that {{the light of the}} ultimate brush or spark is in no relation to the intensity required (1368. 1370.). So to speak, the discharge begins in darkness, and the light is a mere consequence of the quantity which, after discharge has commenced, flows to that spot and there finds its most facile passage (1418. 1435.). As an illustration of the growth generally of discharge, I may remark that, in the experiments on the transition in oxygen of the discharge from spark to brush (1518.), every spark was immediately preceded by a short brush.|$|E
6000|$|... 1445. Several effects which I {{have met}} with in muriatic acid gas tend to make me believe, that that gaseous body allows of a <b>dark</b> <b>discharge.</b> At the same time, it is quite clear from theory, that in some gases, the reverse of this may occur, i.e. that the {{charging}} of the air may not extend even {{so far as the}} light. We do not know as yet enough of the electric light to be able to state on what it depends, and it is very possible that, when electricity bursts forth into air, all the particles of which {{are in a state of}} tension, light may be evolved by such as, being very near to, are not of, those which actually receive a charge at the time.|$|E
40|$|We {{employ a}} number of {{statistical}} measures to characterize neural discharge activity in cat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in their target lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons under various stimulus conditions, and we develop a new measure to examine correlations in fractal activity between spike-train pairs.

The presentation of a constant, uniform luminance to the eye reduces the fractal fluctuations in the RGC maintained discharge but enhances them in the target LGN discharge, so that neural activity in the pair no longer mirror each other. A drifting-grating stimulus yields RGC and LGN driven spike trains similar in character to those observed in the maintained discharge, with two notable distinctions: action potentials are reorganized along the time axis so that they occur only during certain phases of the stimulus waveform, and fractal activity is suppressed. Under both uniform-luminance and drifting-grating stimulus conditions (but not in the <b>dark),</b> the <b>discharges</b> of pairs of LGN cells are highly correlated over long time scales; in contrast discharges of RGCs are nearly uncorrelated with each other.

The aging includes all the processes that lead to a significant degradation of the performances of the detector gain drop, non-uniformity, <b>dark</b> current, <b>discharges</b> and resolution loss. The project is focused on monitoring continuously the response of the detector when irradiated by a source of Cs 137 at CERN in the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF). Moreover, the new technology employed for stretching the GEM foils, so called NS 2, introduces new, carefully chosen materials and components in the detectors. Outgassing tests are performed in order to validate the use of these components. The entire experiment is designed so that all relevant parameters are understood and monitored.

The two rounded terminations (1544.) (fig. 133.), were placed in muriatic acid gas (1445. 1463.) at the pressure of 6.5 inches of mercury, and a continuous machine current of electricity sent through the apparatus: bright sparks occurred until the interval was about or above an inch, when they were replaced by squat brushy intermitting glows upon both terminations, with a dark part between. When the current at the machine was in spark, then each spark caused a discharge across the muriatic acid gas, which, with a certain interval, was bright; with a larger interval, was straight across and flamy, like a very exhausted and sudden, but not a dense sharp spark; and with a still larger interval, produced a feeble brush on the inductric positive end, and a glow on the inducteous negative end, the dark part being between (1544.); and at such times, the spark at the conductor, instead of being sudden and sonorous, was dull and quiet (334.).|$|E

Before concluding my remarks, I will again intimate in the form of a query, whether we have not reason to consider the tension or retention and after discharge in air or other insulating dielectrics, as the same thing with retardation and discharge in a metal wire, differing only, but almost infinitely, in degree (1334. 1336.). In other words, can we not, by a gradual chain of association, carry up discharge from its occurrence in air, through spermaceti and water, to solutions, and then on to chlorides, oxides and metals, without any essential change in its character; and, at the same time, connecting the insensible conduction of air, through muriatic acid gas and the <b>dark</b> <b>discharge,</b> with the better conduction of spermaceti, water, and the all but perfect conduction of the metals, associate the phenomena at both extremes? and may it not be, that the retardation and ignition of a wire are effects exactly correspondent in their nature to the retention of charge and spark in air? If so, here again the two extremes in property amongst dielectrics will be found to be in intimate relation, the whole difference probably depending upon the mode and degree in which their particles polarize under the influence of inductive actions (1338. 1603. 1610.).|$|E

The extracellular activity of single complex-spike cells in area CA 1 of the hippocampus was recorded with glass micropipettes in the rats during passive translations, rotations, and immobility. The robot made a standardized series of trajectories starting from each of four corners of a square enclosure surrounded by black curtains. A drop of water was delivered to the rat each time the robot arrived at one designated corner of the arena. The activities of 29 neurons were investigated in 45 recording sessions (16 of which were in total darkness) in four rats.

30|$|A 37 -year-old {{woman with}} no past medical history {{presented}} to the ED with a chief complaint of headache, body pain, and minimal <b>dark</b> vaginal <b>discharge.</b> In triage, she was febrile to 102.8  °F and tachycardic to 138 beats per minute and thus triggered a sepsis alert. She denied dysuria or pelvic pain. She also denied symptoms consistent with upper respiratory infections or gastrointestinal infections. She exhibited no altered mental status, neck pain, stiffness, or rash. On review of symptoms, she complained of mild right mid back pain. Her examination was unremarkable, including a normal pelvic examination. While she denied oliguria, the patient was initially unable to provide urine. A chest X-ray was normal. Initial lactate was normal at 1.8  mmol/L. Given no clear source of infection, imipenem-cilastatin was ordered. However, before the antibiotic was administered, a point-of-care ultrasound was performed demonstrating unequivocal and maximal tenderness to the right kidney on sonopalpation. At this point, the patient was able to produce {{a small amount of}} urine, and point-of-care urinalysis demonstrated 3 + blood and small leukocyte esterase. Given this, the diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made and ceftriaxone was administered instead of imipenem–cilastatin. Blood tests resulted as unremarkable, and urine culture and gonorrhea and chlamydia tests results were pending. The patient remained tachycardic in the 110  s for two more hours and her oral temperature improved to 99.8  °F. The patient was admitted to the ED observation unit for further doses of intravenous ceftriaxone where she improved dramatically over the subsequent 12  h and was discharged. She completed a course of oral antibiotics with excellent response. On follow-up, the urine culture grew E. coli and gonorrhea and chlamydia tests were negative.|$|R
40|$|A new {{computer-controlled}} {{test system}} for mapping photoreceptor properties such as charge acceptance and discharge voltage will be described. The system allows rapid scanning of a photoreceptor to: 1) characterize its functional quality and uniformity, and 2) detect both charging and discharge defects of 50 - 100 µm in diameter or larger. The system can also perform conventional electrophotographic measurements to obtain <b>dark</b> decay, photo-induced <b>discharge</b> curves (PIDC), and fatigue properties. In addition to testing the complete photoreceptor product, a unique {{feature of the}} system is its ability to perform measurements on the sub-layers in a photoreceptor. These measurements include examining the substrate for cleanliness, and measuring the thickness and uniformity of the polymer barrier layer and the charge generation layer (CGL) in a layered organic photoconductor (OPC). The design of the system will be described, and its performance will be demonstrated with application examples. Test equipment for the charge roller and the magnetic roller in toner cartridges using similar electrostatic charge decay measurement techniques will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|La {{production}} en ascospores d’apothécies de Sclerotinia trifoliorum est évaluée quotidiennement au laboratoire sous diverses conditions. Elle dépend de l’âge et du diamètre des apothécies. Elle est maximale pour des apothécies de 7 à 12 j. La sporulation moyenne, durant leur vie entière, d’apothécies de 4 à 5 mm de diamètre est de 1, 4 x 106 ascospores. La température optimale est de 15 °C, les apothécies demeurant alors sporulantes pendant 18 à 20 j. À 5 °C et 10 °C, la sporulation est plus faible, mais les apothécies demeurent fonctionnelles plus d’un mois. À 25 °C, elles meurent en quelques jours. La sporulation est meilleure à la lumière qu’à l’obscurité. Des apothécies séparées de leurs sclérotes et mises en conditions d’HR satisfaisantes conservent un fonctionnement normal. Soumises au climat naturel, les apothécies projettent leurs ascospores de fin octobre à début décembre, comme l’indiquent des piégeages réalisés avec un capteur par aspiration. La sporulation est la plus forte par temps doux et très humide. Elle est faible en conditions anticycloniques. La projection des ascospores est presque nulle la nuit. Elle débute vers 10 h, est maximale vers 15 - 16 h et cesse vers 19 h. Outre leur intérêt pour une meilleure production d’ascospores utilisables en contaminations artificielles, ces observations précisent les facteurs agissant sur le développement de la sclérotiniose des légumineuses fourragères. Sclerotia of Sclerotinia trifoliorum {{produced in}} the laboratory were placed under favourable conditions for capogenesis at varying temperatures in the light or in the <b>dark.</b> Ascospores <b>discharged</b> by apothecia were counted {{on a daily basis}} throughout the life cycle of the apothecia, ie 18 - 20 d at 15 °C. The quantity of spores collected depended on the diameter and age of the apothecia. The greatest discharge was generally when apothecia were 7 - 12 d old (fig 1). The mean number of ascospores collected from apothecia over the entire life cycle was 1. 4 x 106 from apothecia 4 - 5 mm in diameter and 4. 7 x 106 for apothecia 7 mm in diameter. Temperature directly affected sporulation. Spore discharge was abundant at 25 °C, but lasted only a few hours and the apothecia died within a few days. At 5 - 10 °C discharge was weak, but lasted over 1 month. At 20 and in particular at 15 °C, discharge was optimal, with sporulation continuing for a mean of 3 weeks (fig 2). Light was more conducive to sporulation than dark. Apothecia that had become detached from their stipes maintained normal sporulation and responded to temperature {{in the same way as}} apothecia attached to sclerotia. However, they survived for a somewhat shorter period (fig 3). Sclerotia {{produced in the}} laboratory then subjected to natural climatic conditions in the soil from the beginning of September began to produce apothecia in mid-October. Ascospores that were discharged were collected with a vacuum spore trap (fig 4). In 1987 and 1988, ascospore discharge was studied from the end of October to the beginning of December, ie the period during which the apothecia remained alive. During that time constantly wet soil resulted in normal functioning of the apothecia. Spore discharge was maximal when the weather was mild (10 - 15 °C) and very humid (ie, fog, drizzle or rain). Discharge was slight under anticyclonic conditions when the nights were cold and afternoons sunny. Slight frost did not inhibit further sporulation once conditions became favourable again (fig 5). Ascospore discharge was almost non-existent at night, especially when temperatures were low. Discharge usually began about 10. 00 h, was maximum between 15. 00 and 16. 00 h and ceased at about 19. 00 h (table I and fig 6). This periodicity was related to temperature. The present study has resulted in an enhanced yield of ascospores from apothecia produced in the laboratory for artificial inoculation of red clover in screening for resistance. It has also better defined some important epidemiological factors affecting crown rot of forage legumes...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Xanthoria polycarpa is a foliose lichen, {{commonly}} found as an epiphyte in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. This study was undertaken to determine {{some of the}} effects of environmental factors on ascospore discharge and germination in X. polycarpa. Ascospores were collected on glass slides suspended above lichen thalli. Abundant discharge occurred in the fall, winter, and spring. Discharge in the summer was rare, and occurred only when thalli were wet. Discharge was correlated with rainfall. No striking time pattern of discharge was exhibited by apothecia incubated on moist filter paper. Horizontally discharged ascospores travelled from 1 to 24 mm away from the apothecia. Spores commonly occurred in groups of eight, indicating that all of the spores in one ascus can function as one projectile. Ascospore discharge occurred when apothecia were incubated in the light or in the <b>dark.</b> <b>Discharge</b> occurred at 5, 10, 15, and 20 C. No discharge occurred at 25 or 30 C. Saturated salt solutions were used to produce atmospheres of various relative humidities. Discharge occurred at 100...|$|E

This article appeared in the Journal of Applied Physics and may be found at: [URL] pressure glow discharges are attractive {{for a wide range of}} material-processing applications largely due to their operation flexibility afforded by removal of the vacuum system. These relatively new atmospheric plasmas are nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperature around 100 °C and electron temperature in the 1 – 10 eV range. Their appearance is characteristically diffuse and uniform, and their temporal features are repetitive and stable. Of the reported numerical studies of atmospheric glow discharges, most are based on the hydrodynamic approximation in which electrons are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local electric field. Spectroscopic and electrical measurements suggest however that the cathode fall region is fundamentally nonequilibrium. To this end we consider a hybrid model that treats the cathode fall region kinetically but retains a hydrodynamic description for the region between the thin cathode fall layer and the anode. Using this hybrid model, a helium discharge system excited at dc is studied numerically for a very wide current density range that spans from Townsend <b>dark</b> <b>discharge,</b> through normal glow discharge, to abnormal glow discharge. Numerical results confirm many distinct characteristics of glow discharges and compare well with that of low-pressure glow discharges. Generic relationships, such as that between the electric field and the current density, are also established and are in good agreement with experimental data. This hybrid model is simple and insightful as a theoretical tool for atmospheric pressure glow discharges...|$|E
40|$|For the crayfish, {{properties}} of visually reacting interneurone {{types in the}} optic nerve are described {{on the basis of}} single-unit analysis. Sustaining fibres show: (a) ‘surround’ inhibition over the whole retina, including the excitatory field; (b) ‘on’ and ‘off’ effects at field boundaries; (c) a <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> in deteriorated preparations; (d) an increase in adapted firing rate and response to flashes in an ‘excited state’ of the preparation; (e) increased overall impulse frequency to fast-moving shadows at frequencies of 2 - 10 /sec. which elicit short bursts. Dimming fibres, having mainly reversed properties, show: (a) bursts followed by adaptation to a lower ferquency level of spikes on light dimming; (b) total inhibition by illumination for times proportional to light intensity; (c) responsiveness to quickly moving shadows. 'Jittery’ movement fibres lack directional sensitivity. For them: (a) total illumination and contrast have, within a wide range, no effect on discharges to moving targets; (b) large, dark cards moved at constant speed are seen only near their visual field boundary; (c) the less predictable the movement of a small dark object is, the longer its excitatory effect lasts; (d) responsiveness of field parts exposed is decreased for long durations; (e) no firing is caused by active or passive eye motions. Space-constant fibres show changed location and size of their excitatory fields with eye position. Their potential visual fields below the horizontal plane are unresponsive, due to inhibition caused mainly by statocyst input. Two eye muscle motor fibres, also under statocyst control, are influenced by light on the limited sensory fields of two pairs of identifiable sustaining fibres. The two motor fibres, which innervate antagonistic muscles, are reversely excited and inhibited by these fields...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{suitability}} of amorphous semiconductors as hard field optical sensors for application in optical process tomography (OPT) has been established. Two amorphous semiconductors were selected for the study, these being amorphous arsenic triselenide (a-As 2 Se 3) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-As 2 Se 3 device was a single layered structure of 60 |Um thickness fabricated upon a 2 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. The a-Si:H device was a multi-layered structure of 27. 1 fim overall thickness fabricated upon a 4 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. 20 mm 2 samples were cut from the cylinders, their surface being left free for a xerographic investigation. For a tomographic investigation, semitransparent gold (Au) contacts were sputtered {{onto the surface of}} the devices to produce single contacts or contact arrays. The study comprised of the two fields of xerography and tomography. The xerographic study comprised of the measurement of such parameters as charge acceptance, dark decay, residual potential, and photoinduced discharge. The research project has concurred with other workers in that the <b>dark</b> <b>discharge</b> mechanism in a-As 2 Se 3 proceeds via a xerographic depletion discharge process, and a Poole-Frenkel type emission in a-Si:H. The tomographic investigation involved the study of such parameters as detectivity, responsivity, steady state photocurrent, and photoinduced fatigue. Detectivity has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of applied electric field and level of incident irradiance. Irradiance in the order of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2 for a- fj f As 2 Se 3 and 5. 31 mW/cm to 28. 32 mW/cm for a-Si:H was required in order to produce a clean and repeatable photogenerated current pulse over the range of electric fields specified (0. 66 xl 05 V/cm to 1. 66 xl 05 V/cm). The production of steady state current has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of electric field, the level of irradiance, and the illumination period. Irradiance of 319 mW/cm 2 to 1. 46 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 520 ns was required to produce steady state photocurrent in a-As 2 Se 3, and 693 mW/cm 2 to 2. 62 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 880 ns for a-Si:H. A linear relationship between electric field and responsivity has been observed in both materials over a range of irradiance of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2. Responsivity in the order of 87. 86 |LiAAV to 145. 19 |iA/W for a-As 2 Se 3 and 14. 19 (iAAV to 103. 81) J,AAV for a-Si:H has been demonstrated. An investigation as to the effects of photoinduced fatigue in both a-As 2 Se 3 and a-Si:H has been carried out by the application of pulsed visible light of various flash repetition rate (FRR) under a constant high electric field over a 30 minute illumination period. It has been shown that the rate of fatigue is dependant upon the material, time, electric field, light intensity, and FRR. A maximum operating speed of 20 Hz has been determined for a-As 2 Se 3 and lOOHz for a-Si:H. The maximum operating speed of 20 Hz for a-As 2 Se 3 was deemed unsuitable for OPT application and the a-As 2 Se 3 material was eliminated from further tomographic investigation. Tomographic prototypes were employed to establish the a-Si:H devices ability to produce qualitative and quantitative data. The results of this investigation demonstrated that 1 mm changes in water level and 0. 5...|$|E
