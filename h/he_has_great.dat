5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>great</b> {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} {{eventual}} champions France, Baggio came on {{as a substitute}} for Del Piero in the second half, and managed to create some scoring opportunities. The score remained 0–0, and the match went to extra time, although Baggio came the closest to scoring the golden goal, with a volley from a lobbed pass by Albertini, but his shot was put just wide of Fabian Barthez's far post. The match eventually went to a penalty shootout. Although Baggio converted his penalty, the shootout was won by the host nation, as Italy were eliminated on penalties in a World Cup for the third consecutive time. Italy's coach, was criticised for starting the recovering Del Piero ahead of Baggio, and for not allowing the two players to play alongside each other. Despite rumours that the substitutions had created a rivalry between the players, Baggio and Del Piero remain friends. Baggio stated in 2008 that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>great</b> respect for Del Piero, and that there had never been disagreements between them. Del Piero in turn stated in 2011 that Baggio, along with Zinedine Zidane, was the best player with whom he had ever played.|$|E

500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to let you know, you never have to be more gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>great</b> friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not {{have a problem with it}} and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>great</b> friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing."

Born argues that Naruto as a whole shows Confucian values, and that Naruto himself unsettles harmony in society. Amy Plumb, a PhD candidate at Macquarie University, states that Kishimoto used the mythology of the kitsune for Naruto's development throughout the series. She notes that {{at the beginning of the}} series, Naruto was a prankster and always causing trouble, the same as the kitsune. Plumb describes the Kyuubi (Demon) seal on Naruto's stomach as a [...] for how he develops. Writing for Manga's Cultural Crossroads, Omote Tomoyuki compliments Naruto's character, saying that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>great</b> ambition to achieve a tragic destiny. He comments how the character has matured over the course of the series, stating how after he became a shinobi, he had let go of his childish ways that happened in the beginning of the series, and how he rarely joked around in Part II of the series when he became a teenager. Franziska Ehmcke, professor of Japanese studies at Cologne University, theorized that Naruto was named after whirlpools of the sea landscape of the Awa no Naruto, and compared his behavior to that natural feature, as both figures have uncontrollable energy within them. [...] Mike Hale compared Naruto to Buffy Summers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, praising the series' portrayal of childhood loneliness. [...] Rik Spanjers regards Naruto's childishness as one of his strengths because it gives him a well of resoluteness from which to draw on in his goal to end the ninja wars.|$|E

Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes.

Martyn Davies, a South African emerging markets expert, argued that the decision to invite South Africa made little commercial sense but was politically astute given China's attempts to establish a foothold in Africa.
