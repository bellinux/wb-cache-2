5|$|As {{the threat}} of a German naval attack had been removed by the {{destruction}} of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—Australia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at <b>half</b> <b>speed.</b> Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann—to stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow {{to keep pace with the}} battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.|$|E

While {{many of his}} well known characters, such as Stouffer and Garry Hill, his fictional layabout son from his first marriage, remained, it also showcased several new characters, including Speed Camera Boy, an outsider who is half boy and <b>half</b> <b>speed</b> camera, and Evelynne Hussey, a one woman band who played an number of different instruments.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Moore scoured {{public domain}} films {{looking for one}} that exuded a certain mood, {{intending}} to write a pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was Age 13, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to <b>half</b> <b>speed,</b> and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled Graveyard Mountain Home, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore's music.|$|E

25|$|More common were {{high-voltage}} DC systems – usually 1200 V DC, {{introduced in}} 1908 by Indianapolis & Louisville Traction Company for their Dixie Flyer and Hosie Flyer services. In the streets, where high-speed service was not feasible, the cars ran at <b>half</b> <b>speed</b> at 600 V or got a changeover device. A 2400 V DC third-rail system was {{installed on the}} Michigan United Railways's Western Division between Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids in 1915, but was abandoned because of the safety hazard. Even 5000 V DC was tested.|$|E
25|$|Herrings are pelagic feeders. Their prey {{consists}} of {{a wide spectrum of}} phytoplankton and zooplankton, amongst which copepods are the dominant prey. Young herring usually capture small copepods by hunting them individually— they approach them from below. The (<b>half</b> <b>speed)</b> video loop at the left shows a juvenile herring feeding on copepods. In the middle of the image a copepod escapes successfully to the left. The opercula (hard bony flaps covering the gills) are spread wide open to compensate the pressure wave which would alert the copepod to trigger a jump.|$|E
25|$|After {{driving his}} own car during a handful of races in the 1993 season's first <b>half,</b> <b>Speed</b> was called to drive for Robert Yates Racing, filling in {{following}} Davey Allison's death. Speed qualified fourth at Watkins Glen International. He followed that up with a second place start at Michigan and a seventh-place finish. The next race at Bristol, Speed was running a strong race before contact late with Rick Mast ruined his chances at a top ten finish. After Bristol, Speed was replaced by Ernie Irvan. It was two races later at Dover where Speed found another ride, this time replacing Geoff Bodine who had departed from Bud Moore's Ford to drive his own team which he purchased following Alan Kulwicki's death. Speed's best finish for Moore {{at the end of}} the '93 season was an eleventh at Charlotte.|$|E

25|$|After being aground on {{the beach}} for 24 hours the Nimbin was success-fully refloated under her own power about 9:15am Tuesday 23 February. The cargo was intact but a {{quantity}} of oil was pumped from the tanks The company's vessel Ulmarra, which had been ordered to the scene, was standing by, and had a tow line aboard, but her assistance was not required The dredge Tethys from Ballina also stood by. Sea anchors had been placed some distance to seaward, and were secured with lines to the Nimbin When the tide was at flood, the Nimbin’s motors were started, and she hauled on the anchors, and soon slid off the sand The salvage gear had been taken to the Nimbin on Monday night After picking up the gear the Nimbin proceeded inside the Richmond River, safely negotiating the bar She then commenced to discharge her Sydney cargo The Ulmarra proceeded to the Clarence River. Captain Raymer, of the Nimbin, stated that the vessel was travelling at <b>half</b> <b>speed</b> in a heavy haze, which was hanging low over the sea, when the stranding occurred He said that no damage {{had been done to}} the vessel.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{found the}} social {{guidance}} film Age 13 in the Prelinger Archives, {{which served as}} his main inspiration. He slowed the film down to half its original playback speed to allow a full album to be written around the twenty-five-minute film. With complete creative control over the album, Moore was free to experiment, sometimes writing music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] The deluxe edition of the album contains the film in its full length, played at <b>half</b> <b>speed,</b> with the album as a soundtrack {{in place of the}} original audio.|$|E

All of {{the engines}} had performed hard war service, and had been operated for double the recommended mileage without overhaul. As a result, they were reduced to operating at <b>half</b> <b>speed.</b> Since there were no replacement parts, the gaskets, which normally would have been discarded, had to be carefully cleaned and replaced.

2500|$|The film's cinematographer John Alonzo used {{light-weight}} Arriflex II {{cameras that}} offered {{a great deal}} of flexibility in terms of free movement. Close-up and medium shots were achieved by mounting cameras directly on the vehicles instead of the common practice of filming the drivers from a tow that drove ahead of the targeted vehicle. To convey the appearance of speed, the filmmakers slowed the film rate of the cameras. For example, in the scenes with the Challenger and the Jaguar, the camera's film rate was slowed to <b>half</b> <b>speed.</b> The cars were traveling at approximately [...] so that when projected at normal frame rate, they appeared to be moving much faster.|$|E

The port bridge lookout had come on duty while Voyager was turning to starboard, and raised the alarm when the swing back to port brought Melbourne back into view around 20:55. Melbournes navigation officer ordered the carrier's engines to <b>half</b> <b>speed</b> astern around the same time, which Captain Robertson increased to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard," [...] before instructing the destroyer's quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent.

2500|$|The Compact Cassette {{originally}} {{was intended for}} use in dictation machines. In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based dictation machines could also run the tape at <b>half</b> <b>speed</b> (15⁄16 in/s) as playback quality was not critical.

As of 2009, one still finds cassettes used {{for a variety of}} purposes, such as journalism, oral history, meeting and interview transcripts, audio-books, and so on. Police are still big buyers of cassette tapes, as some lawyers [...] "don't trust digital technology for interviews". However, they are starting to give way to Compact Discs and more [...] "compact" [...] digital storage media.
