Originally begun as a three-member <b>judicial</b> <b>panel,</b> the Court underwent major reforms in 1852 and 1971, {{as well as several}} other reorganizations.

However, in their decision, the panel granted him the possibility of paroled release after fifty years. However, more than a year later, on September 7, 2005, the conviction was overturned by the Maryland Court of Appeals and Logan was awarded a second trial. The judiciary determined that the investigators had acted with impropriety in the process of obtaining of Logan's confession to the murders by violating Logan's Miranda rights, and by deliberately misleading him in order to obtain a confession. The court also determined that the judiciary's selection process of jurors for the trial had not been rigorous enough and had thus been conducted improperly.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} judicial behavior under the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by drawing on an original database of 459 state and Federal appellate cases decided between 1970 and 2009. The authors use logit regression {{to show that}} state judges {{are more likely to}} uphold state and local laws against dormant Commerce Clause attack than their Federal judicial counterparts, a result that is consistent with the interstate rivalry issues animating the doctrine. The study also finds that Republican-dominated <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> at the state level are more likely to side with tax challengers invoking the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine than are Democratic <b>judicial</b> <b>panels.</b> The authors found similar results on tax issues at the Federal level between the years 1993 and 2009. These results suggest that among more conservative judges, traditional anti-regulation attitudes may hold more sway than federalism and judicial restraint. These findings provide insight into the connections between forum selection, politics, and judicial behavior under the doctrine and open avenues for further research...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{remedies}} {{applied in}} the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union have some distinctive features {{as compared to the}} legal remedies used in the national judicial systems. At first, the communitarian justice system originally did not envisage the possibility of filing an appeal with this Court as a regular legal remedy but there were other remedies that could be pursued in respect of the judgments issued by the Court. After the establishment of the Court of First Instance, the Procedural Law of the European Union introduced the possibility of filing an appeal with the Court of Justice against the judgments of the Court of First Instance. Later, the Court of First Instance became competent to decide on appeals against the judgments rendered by the <b>judicial</b> <b>panels,</b> which were established in the meantime. The Court of First Instance and <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> reserved the possibility of using other legal remedies against the final decisions rendered by these judicial authorities. In this respect, the Lisbon Treaty did not bring any significant changes, except that the Court of First Instance was renamed into the General Court whereas the <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> were designated as specialized courts. Taking into account the system of legal remedies recognized by the Procedural Law of the European Union, {{the first part of the}} paper deals with appeals as a regular legal instrument for bringing the case before a higher instance court which is to review the judgment of a lower instance court, including appeals against the decisions of the General Court and specialized courts. In the second part of the paper, the authors focus on the legal remedies which are awarded by the same court that issued the judgment. This category includes the application of a third party and revision, which may be considered as extraordinary legal remedies, as well as the objection against the judgment by default, judgment interpretation, judgment rectification and supplementing the judgment, which are considered to be extraordinary procedural remedies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years, a number of {{empirical}} studies of multi-member <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> have documented a phenomenon popularly known as "panel effects. " Two principal findings of this literature are: (1) the inclusion of even a single (non-pivotal) member from outside the dominant ideological on the panel can induce induces the panel to reverse "like minded" administrative agencies more frequently than would a panel dominated wholly by the majority ideology; and (2) when mixed panels do not reverse, they frequently issue unanimous decisions. These apparently moderating effects of mixed panel composition pose a challenge to conventional median voter theory. In {{the face of this}} challenge, many scholars have offered their own explanation for panel effects (including collegiality; deliberation, whistle-blowing, and others). In this paper, we propose a general model that (among other things) predicts panel effects as a byproduct of strategic information acquisition. The kernel of our argument is that (non-pivotal) minority members of mixed panels have incentives to engage in costly searches for information in cases where the majority members would rationally choose not to do so. As a result, the inclusion of minority members may induce greater information production in a way that increases the likelihood that a mixed panel will overturn ideologically allied agency actors. Our informational account [...] if true [...] has normative implications for the composition of <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> in particular, and for deliberative groups more generally...|$|R

50|$|The {{solution}} to the separability problem for referendums would be set-wise voting, where the voter can express preferences for outcomes of related issues, as this process {{needs to be done}} at a particular time. For matters before juries or <b>judicial</b> <b>panels,</b> either set-wise or sequential voting can be employed to mitigate this problem, as all votes need not be cast in one instance. If sequential voting were employed, the outcome of every vote tally on an issue would be announced before a vote on the next issue would be taken. The drawback to sequential voting in this case would be that there is no means to guarantee that a juror would actually change a successive vote based on a prior verdict.|$|R
