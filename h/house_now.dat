5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their <b>house,</b> <b>now</b> known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, {{to create a new}} house in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. The redesign expanded on some of the existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E
