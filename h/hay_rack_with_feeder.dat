50|$|A <b>hay</b> <b>rack</b> {{is a light}} wooden {{or metal}} {{structure}} for feeding animals. It {{may be used to}} feed domestic livestock such as cattle, horses, and goats, or it may placed in the woods to feed deer. Feeding deer is mostly done in the winter, when the other food sources (green forage) are scarce. <b>Hay</b> <b>racks</b> are filled <b>with</b> <b>hay,</b> and in addition to hay there is often also a mineral lick near the rack where the animals can obtain essential mineral nutrients.|$|R
40|$|Horses {{housed in}} small {{enclosures}} perform minimal exercise. A novel feeder system may promote exercise but may have behavioral consequences. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the ability of horses to learn to use a novel feeding system and determine the behavioral effects of its use. A dynamic feed station was developed to force horses to exercise to continuously access feed. The behaviour of five groups of two horses was assessed while being housed for three days in either a control (contained a simple <b>hay</b> <b>rack)</b> and research (<b>with</b> the novel <b>feeder)</b> paddock. In the research paddock on day 1, horses were taught to use the feeder by the observer. On day 2 (feeder operational) and day 3 (feeder nonoperational) horses were observed for 4 hours per day to determine speed of learning and incidence of aggressive behaviours between horses. Horses quickly learnt to use the feeder system. Learning was affected by domination relationships between horses. Dominating horses learnt faster and aggressive behaviours appeared to be amplified when the feeder was operational. To reduce the stress impact of the feeder system on horses, horses housed together should be well matched to avoid strong domination relationships. The dynamic feeder system could then be utilized more successfully to increase exercise in horses housed in small paddocks...|$|R

40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying on a <b>hay</b> <b>rack</b> produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on a wire <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage. Upper and lower portion of hay dried on the floor and hay dried on the rack were all taken wall by dairy cows, indicating no significant difference of the amount taken. (Received June 30, 1977...|$|R

50|$|The second floor, {{accessed}} {{by a wide}} staircase, holds the grain storage area and <b>hay</b> <b>racks.</b> In earlier times, sleeping quarters for visitors were located on the second floor. A portion of the third floor, {{accessed by}} a narrow set of stairs, {{is open to the}} second floor, to allow the second floor hay to cure. A pulley system with trap doors to the first floor was used to raise grain to this floor, which was then poured into one of the three grain columns for distribution to the livestock and other storage areas.|$|R
60|$|Early in {{the cool}} hush of a June morning in the seventies, a curious vehicle left Farmer Councill's door, loaded with a merry group of young people. It was a huge omnibus, {{constructed}} out of a heavy farm wagon and a <b>hay</b> <b>rack,</b> and was drawn by six horses. The driver was Councill's hired man, Bradley Talcott. Councill himself held between his vast knees the staff of a mighty flag in which they all took immense pride. The girls of the grange had made it for the day.|$|R

40|$|Five {{different}} types of feeders were designed and tested on goats to find out their effectiveness in reducing feed wastage and cost fabrication. Experiment was conducted at Agriculture Research Station (ARS) -Bandipur for two years. Tested feeders were hexagonal, rectangular, <b>hay</b> <b>rack,</b> chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu. Feeders were fabricated using iron bars and woods. They were tested with the adult goats for feed wastage and feed contamination. Experimental feeds were fodders twigs (Tanki), forage (Stylo, Napier), crop residue (straw from black bean) and commercial concentrate. Chain barrel type of feeder was also tested at farmer’s field at Baradi. Rectangular feeders have significantly lower (P< 0. 01) feed wastage (6. 61 % for fodders) compared to other tested feeders. The fabrication cost was NRs 3200, 1700, 700, 900, and 150 for hexagonal, rectangular; <b>hay</b> <b>rack,</b> chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu respectively. The rectangular feeder is suitable for goats feeding in Tarai and {{in the hills of}} Nepal. It has provision for feeding fodders, grasses, crop residues and concentrates together at the same time. Chain barrel type had comparatively higher wastage (10. 7 % for fodder) than the rectangular but was preferred by the farmers due to its low fabricating cost, portable in size, small space required and easy to handle. Therefore, the rectangular feeder is recommended for middle level farmers and chain barrel for small farmers who rear few goats...|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} has two aisles of stalls, with dirt floors {{as part of}} the barn's foundation. One aisle holds 16 stalls for large draft horses, and the other {{contains}} 10 stalls for smaller horses and stallions. Each stall has a small window, a grain bin, and a hay trough. The hay trough is fed by a chute from the <b>hay</b> <b>racks</b> on the second floor. The livestock entrances, on the south and east sides of brace posts, are sheltered under the barn's roof. The ground floor has four large grain storage areas, floor scales, three tack rooms, an office, a repair and storage area, and a chute from the grain storage areas on the second floor.|$|R

The building appears to have been built in two stages, the eastern section has timber trusses and timber frames to the tethering area and looks older than the western end which has steel trusses and partition frames. The tethering area consists of low walls running parallel {{along the length of the}} building, equipped with steel rings for tethering animals and <b>hay</b> <b>racks</b> for them above. When the place is occupied, rails are erected to separate each bay and sawdust and sand bedding is put down. Around most of the perimeter of the building are very basic sleeping quarters for people showing their animals at Ekka. There are a few animal pens under the women's sleeping quarters in the western section. These are for cows in calf or with new calves. In the northwest corner of the building is a room for preparing food used by those sleeping in the building. The building has a later brick extension.|$|R
