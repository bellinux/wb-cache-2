5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years.

5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E

25|$|Spring {{migration}} {{can begin}} {{as early as}} late March, but most Indiana bats <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> their winter hibernacula until late April to early May. Females emerge from hibernacula first, usually between late March and early May. Most males do not begin to emerge until mid- to late April. Females arrive at summer locations beginning in mid-April. Females form summer nursery colonies of up to 100 adult females during summer. Males typically roost alone or in small bachelor groups during the summer. Many males spend the summer near their winter hibernacula, while others migrate to other areas, similar to areas used by females.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{that move}} {{offshore}} generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> continental shelf waters, however still penetrate to depths of 350 m, and possibly deeper. These individuals {{live on the}} outer shelf edges, sill reefs and upper slopes of the deep reef, and {{tend to be more}} solitary than juveniles. Adults have also been sighted around the large oil rig platforms throughout the Gulf of Mexico, where they use the man-made structure like a reef to hunt prey. The larvae and young juveniles of the species live pelagically offshore along the continental shelf and slope, and are also known to congregate around oil platforms, as well as natural floating debris such as sargassum mats.|$|E
25|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to label the {{families}} as aquatic, terrestrial or intermediate, and an indication is given where it is thought that the species is introduced. Some introductions to Great Britain are quite ancient, dating from Roman times or even earlier, for example, Paleolithic. Those species that do not have a shell usually <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> an archeological or fossil record, and therefore it is not always possible to determine whether they are native or introduced. Species are considered to be native, unless otherwise indicated on the list; this information is taken from Kerney, 1999, updated in the case of slugs with the opinions of Rowson et al. 2014.|$|E

25|$|Most of Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr {{refused to}} grant Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, {{the lands of}} the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given {{to her as a}} gift before his death. He refused to accept the {{testimony}} of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims, Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.|$|E
25|$|A parody website cheerupwillsmith.com, {{which was}} created {{for the purpose of}} cheering up Will Smith with the {{perceived}} failure of After Earth, gained some attention in the media,. Flyers were also posted in East Village, Manhattan requesting Scientology members to see After Earth a minimum of three times and then upload a positive video for Will Smith on that website. The site has a video mockumentary of two Sea Org members, along their way to see After Earth, recorded video praises for Will Smith from strangers and cajoled them into signing a billion-year contract with the Church of Scientology. When they delivered the signatures to a local branch of the church near Times Square, a church representative told them they were impersonating the church and threatened to call the police if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave.</b> The video and the site was created by Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler of the comedy duo The Good Liars who had previously pretended to be Time Warner Cable representatives asking people how they can make service worse for customers.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E

25|$|Newborn piglets weigh around 600–1,000 grams, lacking underfur {{and bearing}} a single milk incisor and canine on each {{half of the}} jaw. There is intense {{competition}} between the piglets over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The piglets <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the piglets lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the piglets take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5–3.5 months, the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviours {{at the age of}} 2–3 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1–2 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing {{during the middle of the}} fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4–5 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10–14 years, though few specimens survive past 4–5 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.|$|E

500|$|At the Amsterdam Mahler Festival in May 1920, Mahler's {{completed}} symphonies and {{his major}} song cycles were presented over nine concerts {{given by the}} Concertgebouw Orchestra and choruses, under Mengelberg's direction. The music critic Samuel Langford, who attended the occasion, commented that [...] "we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> Amsterdam greatly envying the diet of Mahler first and every other composer afterward, to which Mengelberg is training the music-lovers of that city." [...] The Austrian music historian Oscar Bie, while impressed with the festival as a whole, wrote subsequently that the Eighth was [...] "stronger in effect than in significance, and purer in its voices than in emotion". Langford had commented on the British [...] "not being very eager about Mahler", and the Eighth Symphony was not performed in Britain until 15April 1930, when Sir Henry Wood presented it with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The work was played again eight years later by the same forces; among those present in the audience was the youthful composer Benjamin Britten. Impressed by the music, he nevertheless found the performance itself [...] "execrable".|$|E
