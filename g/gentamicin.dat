25|$|HeLa {{cells are}} {{commonly}} used as eukaryotic cells in the <b>gentamicin</b> protection assay, but other cells {{can be used as}} well. As for bacteria, only species susceptible to <b>gentamicin</b> can be assayed.|$|E
25|$|Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} (<b>gentamicin)</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} Ménière's disease. Systemic streptomycin (given by injection) and topical <b>gentamicin</b> (given directly to the inner ear) are useful for their ability to affect the hair cells of the balance system. <b>Gentamicin</b> also can affect the hair cells of the cochlea, though, and cause hearing loss in about 10% of patients. In cases that do not respond to medical management, surgery may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gentamicin</b> {{may fail}} to kill all the {{bacteria}} that remained outside the cells.|$|E
25|$|Water extract of Jacaranda mimosifolia shows higher {{antimicrobial}} {{action in}} vitro against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli than <b>gentamicin</b> sulfate does. The extract also acts against Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gentamicin</b> {{protection}} assay or survival assay or invasion assay is {{a method}} used in microbiology. It is used to quantify the ability of pathogenic bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotic {{treatment}} {{should cover}} both S.nbsp&pyogenes and S.nbsp&aureus. This may include {{a combination of}} cephalosporins, penicillins or vancomycin. The addition of clindamycin or <b>gentamicin</b> reduces toxin production and mortality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gentamicin</b> can {{sometimes}} penetrate eukaryotic cells {{and kill the}} internalized bacteria. This may happen if the permeability of the cells somehow increased during the assay, sometimes due to poor handling of the cells.|$|E
25|$|Sabouraud agar is used {{to culture}} fungi and has a low pH that {{inhibits}} the growth of most bacteria; it also contains the antibiotic <b>gentamicin</b> to specifically inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Internalized {{bacteria}} {{may sometimes}} {{not be entirely}} protected from the outside environment, such as when the phagosome (the vacuole surrounding the bacterium inside the cell) is defective in some way. <b>Gentamicin</b> may kill those bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Dysequilibrium {{arising from}} {{bilateral}} loss of vestibular function – such as can occur from ototoxic {{drugs such as}} <b>gentamicin</b> – can also be treated with balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation) although the improvement {{is not likely to}} be full recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{organism}} {{is intrinsically}} resistant to <b>gentamicin</b> and colistin, and {{this fact is}} helpful {{in the identification of}} the organism. Kanamycin is used to kill B.pseudomallei in the laboratory, but the concentrations used are much higher than those achievable in humans.|$|E
25|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{in time the}} various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, <b>gentamicin</b> and doxycycline have proven effective in monotherapeutic treatment of plague.|$|E
25|$|Most newborn {{infants with}} CAP are hospitalized, {{receiving}} IV ampicillin and <b>gentamicin</b> {{for at least}} ten days to treat the common causative agents streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. To treat the herpes simplex virus, IV acyclovir is administered for 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Several {{classes of}} {{antibiotics}} {{are effective in}} treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and <b>gentamicin,</b> tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases.|$|E
25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. <b>gentamicin,</b> amikacin).|$|E
25|$|As {{fluoroquinolone}} {{is one of}} the few antibiotics widely {{effective against}} P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. On the rare occasions where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical <b>gentamicin</b> or colistin may be used.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, <b>gentamicin,</b> nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Those at {{high risk}} may be vaccinated. Those exposed to a case of pneumonic plague may be treated with {{preventative}} medication. If infected, treatment is with antibiotics and supportive care. Typically antibiotics include a combination of <b>gentamicin</b> and a fluoroquinolone. The risk of death with treatment is about 10% while without it is about 70%.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin is {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization {{for the treatment of}} infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with <b>gentamicin</b> {{is recommended}} for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by good wound {{care and}} handwashing. It is usually treated with {{surgery to remove}} the {{infected}} tissue and intravenous antibiotics. Often a combination of antibiotics are used such as penicillin G, clindamycin, vancomycin, and <b>gentamicin.</b> Delays in surgery {{are associated with a}} higher risk of death. Despite high quality treatment the risk of death is between 25% and 35%.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gentamicin</b> {{protection}} assay {{is commonly}} used in pathogen research. The contribution of specific genes or proteins to the bacteria's ability to invade cells can be easily assayed using this method. The gene in question can be knocked out, and the bacteria's invasiveness {{compared with that of}} normal, wild type bacteria. Environmental conditions, such as pH level and temperature, can also be assayed for their effect on invasiveness.|$|E
25|$|Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as kanamycin, <b>gentamicin,</b> streptomycin, etc., {{were once}} {{effective}} against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl {{interactions with the}} ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Ashdown's medium, a {{selective}} medium containing <b>gentamicin,</b> {{may be required}} for cultures taken from nonsterile sites. Burkholderia cepacia medium may be a useful alternative selective medium in nonendemic areas, where Ashdown's is not available. A new medium derived from Ashdown, known as Francis medium, may help differentiate B. pseudomallei from B. cepacia and may help in the early diagnosis of melioidosis, but {{has not yet been}} extensively clinically validated.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as <b>gentamicin</b> or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this method}} can be time consuming, it gives an {{accurate}} {{estimate of the}} number of viable cells (because only {{they will be able to}} grow and form visible colonies). It is therefore extensively used in experiments aiming to quantify the number of cells resisting drugs or other external conditions (for instance the Luria–Delbrück experiment or the <b>gentamicin</b> protection assay). In addition, the enumeration of colonies on agar plates can be greatly facilitated by using colony counters.|$|E
25|$|Several {{antibiotics}} cannot penetrate eukaryotic cells. Therefore, these antibiotics cannot hurt intracellular {{bacteria that}} are already internalized. Using such antibiotics enables us to differentiate between bacteria that succeed in penetrating eukaryotic cells {{and those that do}} not. Applying such an antibiotic to a culture of eukaryotic cells infected with bacteria would kill the bacteria that remain outside the cells while sparing the ones that penetrated. The antibiotic of choice for this assay is the aminoglycoside <b>gentamicin.</b>|$|E
25|$|If E. coli {{bacteria}} {{escape the}} intestinal tract through a perforation (for example from an ulcer, a ruptured appendix, or {{due to a}} surgical error) and enter the abdomen, they usually cause peritonitis that can be fatal without prompt treatment. However, E. coli are extremely sensitive to such antibiotics as streptomycin or <b>gentamicin.</b> Recent research suggests treatment of enteropathogenic E. coli with antibiotics may not improve {{the outcome of the}} disease, as it may significantly increase the chance of developing haemolytic-uremic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of AKI hinges on identification {{and treatment of}} the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a nephrologist. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, {{management of}} AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called nephrotoxins. These include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen, iodinated contrasts such as those used for CT scans, many antibiotics such as <b>gentamicin,</b> {{and a range of}} other substances.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is through}} public health {{measures}} such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. Vaccines have not {{been found to be}} very useful for plague prevention. Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, <b>gentamicin,</b> and doxycycline. Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days. With treatment the risk of death is around 10%. Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths. The disease is most common in Africa.|$|E
25|$|In acute endocarditis, {{due to the}} fulminant {{inflammation}} empirical {{antibiotic therapy}} is started immediately after the blood has been drawn for culture. This usually includes vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV infusions until the microbial identification and susceptibility report with the minimum inhibitory concentration becomes available allowing for modification of the antimicrobial therapy to target the specific microorganism. It {{should be noted that}} the routine use of <b>gentamicin</b> to treat endocarditis has fallen out of favor due to the lack of evidence to support its use (except in infections caused by Enterococcus and nutritionally variant streptococci) and the high rate of complications.|$|E
500|$|For {{women with}} PID of mild to {{moderate}} severity, parenteral and oral therapies appear to be effective. [...] It does not matter to their short- or long-term outcome whether antibiotics are administered to them as inpatients or outpatients. Typical regimens include cefoxitin or cefotetan plus doxycycline, and clindamycin plus <b>gentamicin.</b> An alternative parenteral regimen is ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline. Erythromycin-based medications can also be used. Another alternative {{is to use a}} parenteral regimen with ceftriaxone or cefoxitin plus doxycycline. [...] Clinical experience guides decisions regarding transition from parenteral to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement.|$|E
500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic <b>gentamicin)</b> or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E
