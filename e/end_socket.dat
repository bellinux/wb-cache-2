40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} {{practical}} and comprehensive hybrid rogue access point (AP) detection framework for commodity Wi-Fi networks. It {{is the first}} scheme that combines the distributed wireless media surveillance and the centralized wired <b>end</b> <b>socket</b> level traffic “fingerprinting. ” The former is designed not only to detect various types of rogue APs, but also to discover suspicious activities so as to prevent the adversaries from turning victim APs into rogue devices. Moreover, the socket level traffic fingerprinting helps our frame work to achieve a finer granularity on rogue AP detection among the existing schemes. This framework has the following nice properties: i) it requires neither specialized hardware nor modification to existing standards; ii) the proposed mechanism greatly improves the rogue AP detection probability so that network resilience is improved; iii) it provides a cost-effective solution to Wi-Fi network security enhancement by incorporating free but mature software tools; iv) it can protect the network from adversaries capable of using customized equipment and/or violating the IEEE 802. 11 standard; v) its open architecture allows extra features to be easily added on in the future.

These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R

50|$|Socket {{technology}} for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed {{the direction of}} Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open <b>ended</b> plug <b>socket,</b> created from wood. The advancement {{was due to the}} difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made {{in the shape of a}} square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of a long-range guided wave inspection technique called “magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) ” for inspection of suspender ropes was field-evaluated on the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in New York City.

40|$|A passive capture joint {{with three}} {{degrees of freedom}} is {{presented}} wherein two structural elements are joined together solely by moving the two elements into position, and which when joined together have rotation in all three axes. The inventive apparatus is comprised of two halves: (1) a joint ball mounted on a stem as in a common trailer hitch, and; (2) a socket. The socket consists of a base having an exterior wall and forming an interior chamber, the chamber having a top end and a bottom end, and an interior wall. The chamber is open at the top end, and forms a spherical cup at the bottom <b>end.</b> The <b>socket</b> base's interior chamber is sized to accept the joint ball. The base also forms at least one bore at an acute angle away from the interior chamber's open end. The bores have a first opening in the interior wall of the chamber, and a second opening in the exterior wall of the base. Retaining balls sized to fit within the bores, but to only partially pass through the first opening, are moveably housed within the bores. The retaining balls are moveably held in the first opening by a compression spring housed in the bore. As the joint ball is inserted in the chamber it forces the retaining balls back into the bore until the equator of the joint ball passes. Because the bore is at an acute angle to the chamber the joint ball cannot exit the chamber without the joint being unlocked. The joint is unlocked by rotating a locking ring which encircles the base and covers the second opening. The locking ring has a radial slot for each retaining ball, disposed angularly from the base, and sized to allow passage of the retaining ball in the radial direction when the locking ring is rotated to align the radial slot with the second opening...|$|R

Two kinds of contact stress are introduced in the ball and socket joint, the first is from normal contact while the other is from sliding contact.

In this paper the consideration of the combined effect of buckling Load and contact stress on the ball and socket joints have been taken, epically on the stress distribution in the contact area.

This is done by changing the angles for applied loads with the principle axis, the angle of contact between ball and socket and using different applied loads.

40|$|Datacenters are a {{significant}} capital expense for many enterprises. Yet, they are difficult to manage and are hard to design and maintain. The initial design of a datacenter network tends to follow vendor guidelines, but subsequent upgrades and expansions to it are mostly ad hoc, with equipment being upgraded piecemeal after its amortization period runs out and equipment acquisition is tied to budget cycles rather than changes in workload. These networks are also brittle and inflexible. They tend to be manually managed, and cannot perform dynamic traffic engineering. The high-level goal of this dissertation {{is to reduce the}} total cost of owning a datacenter by improving its network. To achieve this, we make the following contributions. First, we develop an automated, theoretically well-founded approach to planning cost-effective datacenter upgrades and expansions. Second, we propose a scalable traffic management framework for datacenter networks. Together, we show that these contributions can significantly reduce the cost of operating a datacenter network. To design cost-effective network topologies, especially as the network expands over time, updated equipment must coexist with legacy equipment, which makes the network heterogeneous. However, heterogeneous high-performance network designs are not well understood. Our first step, therefore, is to develop the theory of heterogeneous Clos topologies. Using our theory, we propose an optimization framework, called LEGUP, which designs a heterogeneous Clos network to implement in a new or legacy datacenter. Although effective, LEGUP imposes a certain amount of structure on the network. To deal with situations when this is infeasible, our second contribution is a framework, called REWIRE, which using optimization to design unstructured DCN topologies. Our results indicate that these unstructured topologies have up to 100 - 500 % more bisection bandwidth than a fat-tree for the same dollar cost. Our third contribution is two frameworks for datacenter network traffic engineering. Because of the multiplicity of end-to-end paths in DCN fabrics, such as Clos networks and the topologies designed by REWIRE, careful traffic engineering is needed to maximize throughput. This requires timely detection of elephant flows [...] -flows that carry large amount of data [...] -and management of those flows. Previously proposed approaches incur high monitoring overheads, consume significant switch resources, or have long detection times. We make two proposals for elephant flow detection. First, in the Mahout framework, we suggest that such flows be detected by observing the <b>end</b> hosts' <b>socket</b> buffers, which provide efficient visibility of flow behavior. Second, in the DevoFlow framework, we add efficient stats-collection mechanisms to network switches. Using simulations and experiments, we show that these frameworks reduce traffic engineering overheads by at least an order of magnitude while still providing near-optimal performance...|$|R

40|$|Two {{areas of}} {{research}} interest {{in the design and}} use of lower limb prosthetic devices are how foot performance varies with design and how prosthesis alignment affects gait. The current study addressed both of these areas through the use of the JR 3 triaxial transducer mounted {{at the base of the}} socket. The transducer is an innovative form of instrumentation that measures forces and moments at the <b>end</b> of the <b>socket.</b> Traditional measurement of gait uses a force plate buried in the floor of a gait laboratory. The study established that the transducer offers a viable means of instrumentation for amputee gait. It provides insight into performance differences between energy storing and release feet (ESAR) and SACH (solid ankle cushioned heel) feet with respect to gait kinematics and kinetics. The effects of variations in the anterior-posterior alignment of the foot in the sagittal plane also were examined. The prostheses of four unilateral transtibial amputee subjects were instrumented with the transducer by mounting it where the socket is attached to the pylon. The instrument setup was designed to wirelessly transmit data from the transducer to a laptop. This eliminated the need to have subjects tethered to stationary instruments and allowed for data collection of consecutive steps in a range of walking environments. For this study, subjects were instructed to walk on a level surface at a self-selected comfortable speed. Data were recorded to obtain 10 consecutive steps while using both the SACH and an ESAR foot. The walking trial was repeated for several of the feet at three differing alignments: neutral (initial alignment), a shift of the foot + 5 mm anterior from neutral, and a shift of the foot - 5 mm posterior from neutral. Effects from varying foot type as well as alignment were examined with respect to stride characteristics, maximum resultant forces and moments, and the maximum moment arm of the resultant force from the center of the transducer; this moment arm was termed the Effective Moment Arm (EMA). The different design characteristics of SACH versus ESAR feet led to hypotheses that stride characteristics as well as peak resultant forces, moments, and EMA 2 ̆ 7 s would vary between foot types. These hypotheses were examined using transducer data. T-test computations revealed statistically significant differences in all trials. The peak EMA was found to be larger during toe loading for the ESAR feet, and the time spent in stance and the overall gait cycle times were shorter when using the SACH foot. It also was hypothesized that variations in alignment would lead to statistically significant differences in stride characteristics, peak resultant forces, peak resultant moments, and EMA 2 ̆ 7 s. ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the data for all trials. Using statistical analyses, it was found that neutral alignment led to shorter times spent in stance and shorter gait cycle time. With posterior shifts in alignment the moment in the sagittal plane increased during heel loading and, with anterior shifts in alignment, the moment in the sagittal plane increased during toe loading. The study established the feasibility of using a triaxial transducer to analyze some of the characteristics of the gait of transtibial amputees. The transducer appeared to be a useful alternative for investigations that typically use force plates in a gait laboratory. Patterns found in the data indicate statistically significant differences between the ways transtibial amputees respond to feet featuring ESAR design versus feet featuring SACH design. Patterns also indicate statistically significant differences when the sagittal plane alignment of the foot is varied in an anterior-posterior direction. Both sets of findings warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{from water}} power Cue: For most people, {{particularly}} in rural areas, kerosene lamps and battery powered torches are essential sources of light once {{the sun has}} gone down. But kerosene and batteries have costs, and not only financial ones. Smoke from lamps can cause eye and breathing problems, and batteries can damage the environment if they are disposed of carelessly. And with rising oil prices, just lighting a home is requiring {{more and more of}} household income. In Kenya, the NGO Practical Action, also known as ITDG, has been supporting rural communities to set up small-scale water-powered electricity generators. These work by piping water down a steep gradient and onto a turbine, which spins at high speed, generating electric power which is then supplied to homes. The system is known as Pico hydro. In Kathamba village, on the southern slopes of Mount Kenya, Eric Kadenge met with Silas Muchira Gachoki, Secretary of the village Pico hydro project. IN:	?The project has got about ? OUT:	? with 5 bulbs and 2 sockets. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Silas Gachoki, hoping that electricity from a small-scale water-powered generator, or Pico hydro, can be supplied to more villagers in Kathamba, Kenya. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Gachoki	The project has got about 172 members, and the Pico has already served 58 households, which is benefiting around 1, 500 people. We start by contributing a small amount of money. After getting the money, we started building a reservoir, that?s a dam. From there we bought pipes, then we have the gradient where we build the powerhouse down here. We get the turbine. Then we had someone who came with all those technologies and after getting power that?s when we started supplying to those few members you have heard. Kadenge	What are the benefits of this project to the local people here? Gachoki	In fact to mention a few, my neighbour is used to buying paraffin. He has children who are in school. Every week he is using five litres. A litre is costing now 85 shillings. You can see it is more than 400 shillings per week. These dry cells for a radio or a torch are now lasting for one week and it is costing 45 shillings. So per month you are using a lot of money. Whereas whoever is using the power, it is just 80 shillings or 50 shillings the whole month. Kadenge	What kind of geographical environment do you need for you to construct this kind of facility? Gachoki	For someone to have power, first you need water flowing, and it should be flowing yearly, not seasonally. This is not a seasonal stream; it runs all the year round. You need a gradient area, so people has to work hard to get some money because a project like this needs some money to construct a powerhouse. Cables are now costly. You need pipes, generators, the turbine. We need security. You can see we have used the metal doors. Kadenge	And the parts that you have mentioned, the turbines, the motor, is there anything that you need to import or everything is available? Gachoki	Now the turbines and whatever are now locally found. Like ours here has never broken down for those years. So mostly you have to grease the machine. So after every three to four months we have to come here and maintain the machine, you grease it, you look whether the turbines are working well. So for sustainability we don?t have a problem. Kadenge	What are your plans in the future? Do you intend to extend it? Gachoki	Our future plan, as you can see downstream here, we have a big river here, just 800 metres from here, from this powerhouse. We want to extend; we have already bought in fact some materials. We have bought pipes, we have bought blocks, because we have to construct a powerhouse there, which {{we are going to get}} about 10 kilowatts there, whereby we will now be able to supply our 172 members with 5 bulbs and 2 <b>sockets.</b> <b>End</b> of trackHow a Kenyan village gets electricity from running wate...|$|R
