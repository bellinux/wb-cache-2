5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Alder {{lived with}} the Indians he was very ill, a {{condition}} Alder attributed to the Indians' diet. The {{other children in the}} village were friendly towards Alder, and worked together to teach him their language, customs, and traditions. In time, Alder fully adopted the Mingo way of life; he lived, hunted, and fought as an Indian. When he was old enough he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for his hunting skills. He grew attached to his new life and when, in 1783, a trader from Kentucky offered to exchange him for a Shawnee prisoner, Alder refused. Alder was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} United States and in Israel several groups {{have sprung up}} in the last <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> seek to support those who {{identify}} as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBT children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women's group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod ("Majesty"). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBT people with whom to share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.|$|E

U2 sang the refrain [...] "el pueblo vencerá", which means [...] "the people will overcome" [...] in Spanish, {{at the conclusion of}} the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said [...] "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric." [...] Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song [...] "40", and so they were looking to replace it with [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] from that point on. He explained, [...] "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> <b>that</b> will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it.

2500|$|Peasants {{were rarely}} figured in {{literature}} during the Qin dynasty and afterwards; scholars {{and others of}} more elite status preferred the excitement of cities and the lure of politics. One notable exception to this was Shen Nong, the so-called [...] "Divine Father", who taught that households should grow their own food. [...] "If in one's prime he does not plow, someone {{in the world will}} grow hungry. If in one's prime she does not weave, someone in the world will be cold."

[...] She asserted film had become [...] "hypnotized {{by the sound of}} its own voice." [...] She said that words should neither reduce the camera work nor repute what the camera says. Graves praised Rowland Brown ast one of the few writers or directors to go against the tide of words. She credits Brown with [...] "the first appearance of a style that remains unique in the development of motion picture dialogue [...] "both in [...] "Doorway to Hell" [...] and [...] "Quick Millions." [...] Graves illustrates Brown's style with the final scene from [...] "Quick Millions," [...] in which the gang leader, Spencer Tracy says, [...] "take your elbow out of my ribs," [...] and the lieutenant says, [...] "That's not my elbow." [...] An unseen hand pulls down a shade and the audience hears two shots. End of movie! In comparison, Graves points to Franchot Tone's [...] "pretty speech" [...] at the end of [...] "Mutiny on the Bounty," [...] suggesting the words get lost against the dramatic background.|$|E
