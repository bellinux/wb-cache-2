50|$|The European Union {{expressed}} its {{concern about}} the personal information management. On January 25, 2012, Viviane Reding, the vice chairperson of the European Commission, suggested General Data Protection Regulation which is a more strict form than the Directive 95/46/EC is. This is a right to ask service providers to delete the personal information which were collected by data brokers under a users’ consent in order to strengthen the user information protection. The {{right to be forgotten}} also includes the notion of not to be searched, and <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> of information.|$|E
5000|$|Desperate for money, Andreas {{sold the}} rights to the Byzantine crown which he possessed since the death of his father. Charles VIII of France {{purchased}} the rights of succession from Andreas during 1494 and died on April 7, 1498. The following Kings of France continued the claim and used the Imperial titles and honors: Louis XII, Francis I, Henry II and Francis II. Not until Charles IX in 1566 did the imperial claim come to an eventual end through the rules of <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> {{as a direct result of}} desuetude or lack of use. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title [...] "is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter." ...|$|E
50|$|In Jacobs v Adonis, Jacobs was, in August 1988, a {{passenger}} in Adonis's vehicle when an accident occurred, rendering him paraplegic. He also suffered memory loss, such {{that he had}} no recollection of the incident. Adonis told Jacobs that his injuries had been sustained in a hit-and-run, so that {{there was no one to}} sue. Jacobs duly claimed compensation from the Road Accident Fund. Some time later, the discovery was made that it had in fact been Adonis who caused the accident. Jacobs accordingly sued him. Because he had had no knowledge of the debtor or of the true facts of the accident until these revelations, Jacobs's claim was well within the three-year period, and Adonis's defence of <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> could not stand.|$|E
50|$|Van Heerden JA held—and Harms JA, Zulman JA, Navsa JA and Mthiyane JA concurred—that, {{under section}} 11(d) of the Prescription Act, the plaintiff's claim {{was subject to}} a three-year <b>extinctive</b> period of <b>{{prescription}}.</b> He held, further, that under section 12 of the Act prescription of a debt (which included a delictual debt) began running when the debt became due: A debt became due when the creditor acquired knowledge of the facts from which the debt arose; in other words, when the creditor acquired a complete cause of action for {{the recovery of the}} debt, or when the entire set of facts upon which he relied to prove his claim was in place.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> {{entails the}} {{termination}} of obligations, and therefore their enforceability, by lapse of time. This ensures finality in business affairs and provides an incentive for persons to enforce their rights when they become due. It is regulated by the Prescription Act and the Institution of Legal Proceedings Against Certain Organs of State Act. The former indicates that claims to a debt are restricted to {{a certain period of}} time, after which they fall away; one has to exercise one's rights within that period if one desires performance. This residual time amounts to three years, and prescription begins to run when ‘the debt falls due’. Furthermore, ‘a debt shall not be deemed to be due until certain requirements are satisfied’. These are, {{on the part of the}} creditor: ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the institution}} of the <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription,</b> first synthesizing the common law stated by the Romanian Civil Code (Section I) and then the special regulation given by the Romanian Code of Fiscal Procedure (Section II) in which we differentiate between the particular legal regime of the <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> {{in the area of the}} rights of claim (Section 2. 1 - 2. 2), in the area of the right to initiate the foreclosure (Section 2. 3), and in that of the right to ask for compensation and restitution (Section 2. 7). The comparison between the legal regime of the <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> in civil law and its regulation given by the fiscal law it is stated by the last section, structured into similarities and differences...|$|E
40|$|The Draft Regulation on a Common European Sales Law (CESL) {{deals with}} {{prescription}} in Articles 178 to 186. This paper discusses {{the level of}} legal harmonization supposedly achieved within the European Union concerning <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription.</b> A number of significant inaccuracies that might substantially affect the effectiveness and application of the Optional Instrument are noted, demanding an amendment before becoming EU law.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of “continuing breaches” {{for the purposes}} of determining jurisdiction ratione temporis has taken on particular importance in the past several years. Most bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments include clauses that establish temporal limitations on jurisdiction, but they do not explicitly address “continuing breaches. ” Recently, NAFTA tribunals have considered this question under the three year time limitation of NAFTA Article 1116 (2), but the issue still remains largely unresolved. This paper will analyze “continuing breaches” in both investment law and general international law and conclude that “continuing breaches” are not valid exceptions to established time limitations in investment treaties. Section I will introduce policy considerations; Section II will analyze the specific language of Article 1116 (2) in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter VCLT); Section III will consider international law on jurisdiction ratione temporis and <b>extinctive</b> <b>prescription</b> more broadly, with particular focus on Article 14 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility and the concept of “continuing violations” in international law; Section IV will review the existing jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American human rights systems with respect to “continuing violations;” Section V will examine existing NAFTA jurisprudence that has considered this question; and Section VI will offer general conclusions and prudential considerations on jurisdiction ratione temporis...|$|E
