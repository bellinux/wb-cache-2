50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that excessive sweating due to strenuous exercise can lead to muscle cramps. Deficiency of sodium and other electrolytes may lead to contracted interstitial fluid compartments, which may exacerbate the muscle cramping. According to this theory, the increased blood plasma osmolality from sweating sodium losses causes a fluid shift from the interstitial space to the <b>intervascular</b> space, which causes the interstitial fluid compartment to deform and contributes to muscle hyperexcitability and risk of spontaneous muscle activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the bioenergetic status of human glioma xenografts in nude mice and morphometric parameters of the perfused vascular architecture was studied using (31) P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), fluorescence microscopy and two-dimensional digital image analysis. Two tumour lines with a different vascular architecture were used for this study. <b>Intervascular</b> distances and non-perfused area fractions varied greatly between tumours of the same line and tumours of different lines. The inorganic phosphate-nucleoside triphosphate (P(i) /NTP) ratio increased rapidly as mean <b>intervascular</b> distances increased from 100 microm to 300 microm. Two morphometric parameters - the percentage of <b>intervascular</b> distances larger than 200 microm (ivd 200) and the non-perfused area fraction at a distance larger than 100 microm from a nearest perfused vessel (area 100), - were deduced from these experiments and related to the P(i) /NTP ratio of the whole tumour. It is assumed that an aerobic to anaerobic transition influences the bioenergetic status, i. e. the P(i) /NTP ratio increased linearly with the percentage of ivd 200 and the area 100...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Background: There is {{controversy}} over whether seizures, {{the most common}} manifestation of neonatal brain injury, may themselves damage the developing brain. Objective: To determine if neonatal seizures are independently associated with brain injury in newborns with perinatal asphyxia. Methods: Ninety term neonates were studied with MRI and single-voxel 1 H-MRS on median day of life 6 (range 1 to 13 days). The severity of MR abnormality in the 1 H-MRS regions of interest was scored using a validated scale. Seizure severity was scored based on seizure frequency and duration, EEG findings, and anticonvulsant administration. Multivariable linear regression tested the independent association of seizure severity with impaired cerebral metabolism measured by lactate/choline and compromised neuronal integrity measured by N-acetylaspartate/choline in both regions. Results: Clinical seizures occurred in 33 of 90 infants (37 %). Seizure severity was associated with increased lactate/choline in both the <b>intervascular</b> boundary zone (p � 0. 001) and the basal nuclei (p � 0. 011) when controlling for potential confounders of MRI abnormalities and amount of resuscitation at birth. Each increase in seizure score was independently associated with a 21 % increase in lactate/choline in the <b>intervascular</b> boundary zone (95 % CI, 5. 1 – 38. 2 %) and a 15 % increase in the basal nuclei (95 % CI, 0. 1 – 31. 7 %). Seizure severity was independently associated with diminished N-acetylaspartate/choline in the <b>intervascular</b> boundary zone (p � 0. 034). Conclusion: The severity of seizures in human newborns with perinatal asphyxia is independently associated with brain injury and {{is not limited to}} structural damage detectable by MRI...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>intervascular</b> pit membranes with a torus {{was investigated in}} juvenile wood samples of 19 species of Ulmus and seven related genera. • A staining solution of safranin and alcian blue (35 : 65) was recommended to distinguish torus-bearing pit membranes using light microscopy. • <b>Intervascular</b> pit membranes connecting relatively wide vessel elements resembled those of most angiosperms, as they were of uniform thickness. By contrast, bordered pit pairs with round to oval pit apertures and indistinct pit canals that connected narrow (incomplete) vessel elements or vascular tracheids with distinct helical thickenings were frequently characterized by a torus in ring-porous wood samples of Ulmus and Zelkova. Tori were lacking in diffuse-porous species of Ampelocera, Aphananthe, Gironniera, Holoptelea, Phyllostylon, Trema and Ulmus. • Our observations suggest that tori are more common in cold temperate climates than in warm (sub) tropical environments. This may indicate that narrow tracheary elements with torus-bearing pit membranes provide an auxiliary conducting system which is of low conductivity, but offers greater resistance to freezing-induced cavitation...|$|E

Dar were stained in several dural zones (vascular, perivascular, <b>intervascular)</b> in different regions (basal, calvarial, tentorial, occipital, frontal, parietal, temporal) of the cranial meninges. Specimens of human dura mater were harvested from autopsies of 10 elderly male subjects (age range, 60 - 75 years). Dar were labeled with specific (H 3) markers, studied with radiobinding techniques (including liquid scintillation), stained for light microscope autoradiography, and measured by means of quantitative analysis of images. All results were evaluated with statistical analysis to identify significant results. More dural Dar were found in the basal region than in the calvarial one. Moreover, Dar are more abundant in the vascular and perivascular dural zone than in the <b>intervascular</b> one. The vascular distribution of Dar seemed to indicate that Dar {{play a role in the}} control of meningeal blood vessels.

40|$|To provide {{comprehensive}} {{illustrations of}} {{anatomy of the}} relevant vessels in large experimental animals in an interactive format as preparation for developing an effective and safe transcatheter technique of aortopulmonary and bidirectional cavopulmonary <b>intervascular</b> anastomoses. Computed tomographic angiographic studies in two calves and two sheep were used to prepare 3 D reconstructions of the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and caval and pulmonary veins. Based on these reconstructions, computer simulations {{of the creation of}} stent-enhanced aortopulmonary and bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomoses were made. We observed the following major anatomical features: (i) caudal course of the main pulmonary artery and its branches with the proximal right pulmonary artery located immediately caudal to the aortic arch, and with the central left pulmonary artery lying at a substantial distance from the descending aorta; and (ii) the distal right pulmonary artery is located dorsal to the right atrium and inferior caval vein at a substantial distance from the superior caval vein. Animations showed creation of transcatheter analogues of Waterston's and Potts' aortopulmonary shunts through placement of a covered spool-shaped stent, and the transcatheter creation of bidirectional Glenn's cavopulmonary anastomosis, by placement of a long covered trumpet-shaped stent. There are considerable differences in vascular anatomy between large experimental animals and humans. Given the need to elaborate new transcatheter techniques for <b>intervascular</b> anastomoses in suitable animal models before application to human, it is crucial to take these anatomical differences into account during testing and optimization of the proposed procedure...|$|E

Choroidal nerve fibers were present in the suprachoroid and vascular laminae and absent in the choriocapillary layer. These fibers may be classified as perivascular and <b>intervascular.</b> Perivascular fibers surround all arterial and venous blood vessels and form a network; these fibers were labeled with the three NF antibodies, although they were more easily visualized with anti NF- 160 and anti NF- 200 than anti NF- 68. <b>Intervascular</b> fibers formed two groups. The first group consisted of fibers situated between the blood vessels and parallel to the blood vessel wall surface (paravascular fibers); these fibers were better observed using anti NF- 160 and NF- 200 than anti NF- 68. The second group consisted of fibers which travel {{the entire length of the}} choroid until they reach the nerve plexus of the ciliary body (long tract fibers). The plexus was observed with anti NF- 68, anti NF- 160 and anti NF- 200; however, the long tract fibers were more clearly visualized with anti NF- 160 and anti NF- 200 than with anti NF- 68. Two types of choroidal cell were also labeled: ganglion cells and melanocytes. Ganglion cells are small, scarce neurons situated in the peripheral choroid; they were labeled with anti NF- 160 and anti NF- 200. The melanocytes were only labeled with anti NF- 200 and they were the only non neuronal structure visualized using antibodies against neurofilaments...|$|E
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 47 genera of the neotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail. The wood anatomy of the neotropical part of this pantropical family supports the subdivision into two groups: the subfamily Memecyloideae (the genus Mouriri) and the subfamily Melastomatoideae (all other genera). A relationship of Mouriri with other representatives of the family is {{not supported by the}} wood anatomical characters, because of differences in fibre type, vessel distribution, and the fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the presence of included phloem in Mouriri. The subfamily Melastomatoideae is a fairly homogeneous group. Although some characters are very pronounced in some tribes and scarce or absent in other tribes, most tribes show a wide overlap in their wood anatomical features. An important means to distinguish to a certain extent between tribes is {{the size and shape of}} the <b>intervascular</b> pits combined with the size and shape of the vessel—ray and vessel—parenchyma pits. Three groups can be recognized: type 1. all pits round to slightly oval; type 2. <b>intervascular</b> pits round to oval, and the vessel—ray and vessel—parenchyma pits more elongated, oblong to scalariform; type 3. all pits round to oblong and scalariform. Other diagnostic characters are the parenchyma distribution, and the distribution of the fibre pits. The tribe Blakeeae can be separated from the other tribes due to the presence of druses and 2 - 4 -seriate rays.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} preretinal {{partial pressure}} of oxygen (PO 2) gradients {{before and after}} experimental pars plana vitrectomy. METHODS: Arteriolar, venous, and <b>intervascular</b> preretinal PO 2 gradients were recorded in 7 minipigs during slow withdrawal of oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes (10 -μm tip diameter) from the vitreoretinal interface to 2 mm into the vitreous cavity. Recordings were repeated after pars plana vitrectomy and balanced salt solution (BSS) intraocular perfusion. RESULTS: Arteriolar, venous, and <b>intervascular</b> preretinal PO 2 at the vitreoretinal interface were 62. 3 ± 13. 8, 22. 5 ± 3. 3, and 17. 0 ± 7. 5 mmHg, respectively, before vitrectomy; 97. 7 ± 19. 9, 40. 0 ± 21. 9, and 56. 3 ± 28. 4 mmHg, respectively, immediately after vitrectomy; and 59. 0 ± 27. 4, 25. 2 ± 3. 0, and 21. 5 ± 4. 5 mmHg, respectively, 2 ½ hours after interruption of BSS perfusion. PO 2 2 mm from the vitreoretinal interface was 28. 4 ± 3. 6 mmHg before vitrectomy; 151. 8 ± 4. 5 mmHg immediately after vitrectomy; and 34. 8 ± 4. 1 mmHg 2 ½ hours after interruption of BSS perfusion. PO 2 gradients were still present after vitrectomy, with the same patterns as before vitrectomy. CONCLUSION: Preretinal PO 2 gradients are not eliminated after pars plana vitrectomy. During BSS perfusion, vitreous cavity PO 2 is very high. Interruption of BSS perfusion evokes progressive equilibration of vitreous cavity PO 2 with concomitant progressive return of preretinal PO 2 gradients to their previtrectomy patterns. This indicates that preretinal diffusion of oxygen is not altered after vitrectomy. The beneficial effect of vitrectomy in ischemic retinal diseases or macular edema {{may be related to}} other mechanisms, such as increased oxygen convection currents or removal of growth factors and cytokines secreted in the vitreous...|$|E
30|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes in}} wood tissues of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) upon treatment with the ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]), which can dissolve cellulose, were investigated.

The dopaminergic receptors of cranial dura mater in man were studied by examining several dural zones (vascular, pen-vascular, inter-vascular) in different brain regions (basal, calvarial, tentorial, occipital, frontal, parietal, temporal). Results. Our results demonstrate that dopaminergic receptors are present in human cranial dura mater and that these receptors show a specific morphological location.

Methods: Plasma-treated collagen-I–coated silicone samples were placed into the dorsal skinfold chambers of female balb/c mice (n = 10). Conventional silicone served as control (n = 10). Intravital microscopy was performed within implant’s surrounding tissue on days 1, 5, and 10. Functional vessel density, <b>intervascular</b> distance, vessel diameter, microvascular permeability, red blood cell velocity, and leukocyte-endothelium interaction were determined. Results: Enhanced angiogenesis in the tissue surrounding plasma-pretreated collagen-coated implants was noted. Significant increase of functional vessel density due to vascular new development was observed (t test, P <. 05).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} systemic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on optic disc oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) in normoxia and hypercapnia. METHODS: <b>Intervascular</b> optic disc PO(2) was measured in 12 anesthetized minipigs by using oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes placed 0. 1), despite a 21 % increase of mean arterial pressure. Optic disc PO(2) increase under hypercapnia was blunted after L-NAME injection (DeltaPO(2) = 0. 6 +/- 1. 1 mm Hg; 3 %; P > 0. 1), and this effect was reversible by L-arginine. Moreover, L-NAME reduced the response to carbogen by 29 % (DeltaPO(2) = 9. 1 +/- 4. 4 mm Hg; 49 %; P = 0. 01 versus before L-NAME). The response to hyperoxia was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas systemic NOS inhibition did not affect optic disc PO(2) in normoxia, a blunting effect was noted on the CO(2) -induced optic disc PO(2) increase.

30|$|Recently, we have {{identified}} a transporter gene involved in phloem Cd transport (Uraguchi et al. 2011). This rice gene, named OsLCT 1, is the homolog of wheat Low-affinity Cation Transporter 1 (Clemens et al. 1998), and encodes a Cd-efflux transporter on the plasma-membrane. OsLCT 1 expression was higher in leaf blades and nodes during reproductive stages. Especially in node I, the uppermost node, OsLCT 1 was mainly expressed in diffuse vascular bundles which connected to panicles. In the Nipponbare background, Cd levels in grains and phloem exudate from leaf blades were substantially reduced in RNAi plants compared to control plants, although Cd concentration in xylem sap did not differ. These results suggest that OsLCT 1 in leaf blades functions in Cd remobilization by phloem, and in node I, OsLCT 1 is likely to {{play a part in}} <b>intervascular</b> Cd transfer from enlarged large vascular bundles to diffuse vascular bundles, which connect to the panicle.

Methods Forty-nine species representing 12 families of the order Ericales were investigated using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were compared with four species of Oleaceae to determine {{the true nature of}} the thickenings. Key Results Pit membranes with torus-like thickenings were observed in seven species of Ericaceae and were found to be amorphous, plasmodesmata-associated structures with an irregular distribution. These pseudo-tori show major differences compared with true tori with respect to their distribution and ultrastructure. Genuine tori, which are strongly correlated with round pit apertures in narrow tracheary elements, were found in two species of Osmanthus (Oleaceae). Conclusions The pseudo-tori found in some Ericaceae are considered to be similar to pit membrane thickenings previously recorded in Rosaceae. While true tori appear to be functionally significant in terms of efficiency and safety of water transport, the possible function of pseudo-tori could be associated with the role of plasmodesmata during differentiation of tracheids, fibre-tracheids or narrow vessels...|$|E

Investigation of this complex system is facilitated by Ki-M 1 P, a new monoclonal antibody which recognizes a differentiation antigen on monocytes/macrophages in paraffin-embedded tissues. To test its usefulness as a pan-macrophage marker in the skin, we immunohistochemically analysed paraffin-embedded biopsy material from seven healthy individuals and 190 patients {{with a variety of}} dermatoses. Immunoreactivity was compared with results obtained with the antibodies KP- 1, MAC- 387, UCHL- 1 and S- 100. In normal skin, epidermal Langerhans cells were Ki-M 1 P-. Strong expression of this marker was detected on spindle-shaped as well as dendritic perivascular and <b>intervascular</b> macrophages. Pathological reaction forms such as giant cells and epithelioid cells in granulomatous dermatoses were also Ki-M 1 P+. The high specificity of Ki-M 1 P is reflected in the lack of reactivity with tumour cells in non-monocytic neoplasms and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Thus, Ki-M 1 P is a useful marker for skin macrophages, discriminating between the immunoaccessory and the phagocytic compartments...|$|E

Stem samples were collected at a breast height (1. 30 m from the soil), root samples were collected 30 to 40 cm from the stem base. There were both qualitative and quantitative variation between root and stem wood. Distinct growth rings demarcated were observed in stem and root wood. Simple perforation plates were found in the vessel elements in root and stem wood. Forked fibers, fibers with cavities and interruptions in their wall, and septate fibers were observed in the wood of both organs. Uni- and multiseriate rays were found in the wood of the two organs, one to three cells wide in the stem and one to four cells wide in the root. The relevant quantitative characteristics between root and stem wood in A. sellowiana were: length, diameter and frequency of vessel; fiber wall diameter and thickness; ray width, height and frequency; and <b>intervascular</b> pit diameter...|$|E
40|$|The air {{permeability}} in longitudinal and radial directions of compression wood in spruce (Picea abies) and tension wood in beech (Fagus sylvatica) was {{compared with that}} of the corresponding normal wood. The primary aim {{of the present study was}} to explain why the reaction woods dry more slowly than the normal woods in the domain of free water. A number of boards conventionally dried to an average final moisture content of 12 % were chosen to perform the measurements. Bordered pits on the radial walls of longitudinal tracheids in the compression and normal wood and intervessel or <b>intervascular</b> pits in the tension and normal wood were also examined. The reaction wood of both species is less permeable than the normal wood, both in longitudinal and radial directions. The difference in permeability was more pronounced between compression and normal wood of spruce, especially in longitudinal direction. From an anatomical point of view, this is likely related to some differences in anatomical characteristics affecting the airflow paths, such as the pit features. Such results can explain the difference in drying kinetics of the reaction and normal woods in the capillary regime of drying...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} casting method {{represents one}} of the most widely used technique to study the 3 D microvascularization of many tissues, both in their normal and pathological conditions. For a long time this technique was used only to perform a qualitative evaluation of the images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A quantitative evaluation of vascular parameters (e. g., interbranching and <b>intervascular</b> distances, angle measurements, lengths and diameters) was lacking, mainly because of the difficulties found in the measurement performed on 2 D SEM images. Then, some authors reported a quantitative method based on the analyses of stereo-pair images that allowed precise morphometric measurements. To visualize the specimens in 3 D, it was necessary to use red-green glasses. In this article we describe a new approach by which we can automatically obtain a 3 D reconstruction of vascular cast specimen's surface directly from stereo-images. Moreover, we developed a software that performed micrometric measurements on the 3 D construct generated from the stereo-pictures. In conclusion, implementing together these two softwares and applying them to corrosion casting samples made it possible to render in 3 D the surface of corrosion cast as well as make quantitative measurementson the corrosion casts...|$|E
40|$|Sassafrasoxylon gottwaldii sp. nov. {{is a new}} taxon for fossil {{wood with}} a suite of {{features}} diagnostic of Sassafras Nees & Eberm. of the Lauraceae. The fossil wood described is from Late Cretaceous (Santonian- Maastrichtian) sediments of the northern Antarctica Peninsula region. This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with simple perforation plates and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate <b>intervascular</b> pitting, marginal (initial) parenchyma bands and paratracheal vasicentric parenchyma in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells. The fossils were found as isolated pieces of wood and therefore it is not certain whether the parent plant was Sassafras- like in all characters. Consequently the fossils {{have been placed in}} an organ genus rather than in extant Sassafras. This is the oldest record of an organ with features closest to extant Sassafras and may suggest that Sassafras first appeared in Gondwana and later radiated into the Northern Hemisphere. The distribution of extant Sassafras in North America and East Asia may represent a relict of a geographically more widespread taxon in the past...|$|E
