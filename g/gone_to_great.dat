5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> expense {{to prepare the}} studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths to train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E

500|$|Jacques Parizeau, {{who had not}} {{prepared}} a concession speech, rejected one prepared by Jean-François Lisée and spoke without notes. Noting that 60% of French-speakers had voted yes, he stated that he would address French-speaking Québécois as [...] ("we"), {{and that they had}} spoken clearly in favour of the [...] "Yes." [...] He then stated that the only thing that had stopped the [...] "Yes" [...] side was [...] "money and ethnic votes" [...] and that the next referendum would be successful with only a few percentage more of French speakers onside. The remarks, widely lambasted in the Canadian and international press as ethnocentric, sparked surprise and anger in the [...] "Yes" [...] camp, as the movement had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths to disown ethnic nationalism.|$|E
500|$|The {{incineration}} of Sava's relics {{provoked the}} Serbs, and empowered the Serb liberation movement. From 1596, {{the center of}} anti-Ottoman activity in Herzegovina was the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, where Metropolitan Visarion was seated. Many of the Orthodox bishops appealed to the Archduchy of Austria for help in liberating their lands. The Uskoks, irregular soldiers in Habsburg Croatia, supported Austria, being scattered over the whole area between Senj and Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik). With a daring raid on April 8, 1596, the Uskoks even managed to occupy the Klis Fortress, though {{they were unable to}} hold it. At one point, Austrian officials considered taking military action in Bosnia, where Dalmatian-born Maltese knight Franjo Brtučević was in their service. However, they did not have the strength to fight the Ottomans in Bosnia. Earlier, Austrian forces had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths and still barely managed to resist the Ottomans in Hungary.|$|E

500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} Kim Randell {{noted that}} [...] "Gearbox has obviously <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> pains {{to provide a}} similar experience to the original". Praise was also given to the game's multiplayer; Randell stated that the new additions for multiplayer made it the area of Opposing Force that [...] "really shines". Randell closed the review by concluding that Opposing Force is [...] "an awesome achievement". Erik Wolpaw, writing for GameSpot, noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre, [...] "it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs". Wolpaw praised {{the design of the}} single-player campaign, commenting that [...] "you can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing". Although criticizing some elements of the game's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as [...] "merely window dressing", the review concluded that Opposing Force was an [...] "impassioned application of creative design".|$|E
500|$|Offa died on 29 July 796, and may {{be buried}} in Bedford, {{though it is not}} clear that the [...] "Bedeford" [...] named in that charter was {{actually}} Bedford. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith [...] "has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son." [...] It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.|$|E

In November 2011 Marc Caputo of the Miami Herald wrote that the scandal over Bedier threatened the Jewish vote for Nelson, given that Bedier had called Israel a [...] "terrorist state."

60|$|One thing not {{suspected}} by the Teutsch Ritters, {{and least}} of all by their young Hochmeister, was, That the Teutsch Ritters had well deserved that terrible down-come at Tannenberg, that ignominious dismissal out of West-Preussen with kicks. Their insolence, luxury, degeneracy had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> lengths. Nor did that humiliation mend them at all; the reverse rather. It was deeply hidden from the young Hochmeister as from them, That probably they were now at length got {{to the end of}} their capability: and ready to be withdrawn from the scene, as soon as any good way offered!--Of course, they Were reluctant enough to fulfil their bargain to Poland; very loath they to do Homage now for Preussen, and own themselves sunk to the second degree. For the Ritters had still their old haughtiness of humor, their deepseated pride of place, gone now into the unhappy CONSCIOUS state. That is usually the last thing that deserts a sinking House: pride of place, gone to the conscious state;--as if, in a reverse manner, the House felt that it deserved to sink.|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} seen a lion--his mother had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>great</b> pains to prevent it. But he had devoured countless {{pictures}} of them, and now he was ravenous to feast his eyes upon the king of beasts in the flesh. As he trailed Akut he kept an eye cocked over one shoulder, rearward, in the hope that Numa might rise from his kill and reveal himself. Thus it happened that he dropped some little way behind Akut, and the next he knew he was recalled suddenly to a contemplation of other matters than the hidden Numa by a shrill scream of warning from the Ape. Turning his eyes quickly in the direction of his companion, the boy saw that, standing in the path directly before him, which sent tremors of excitement racing along every nerve of his body. With body half-merging from a clump of bushes in which she must have lain hidden stood a sleek and beautiful lioness. Her yellow-green eyes were round and staring, boring straight into the eyes of the boy. Not ten paces separated them. Twenty paces behind the lioness stood the great ape, bellowing instructions to the boy and hurling taunts at the lioness in an evident effort to attract her attention from the lad while he gained the shelter of a near-by tree.|$|E
