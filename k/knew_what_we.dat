[...] Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation between Moriarty and Holmes into these three episodes, but realised that they [...] "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other." ...|$|E

[...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{introduced}} Holly Flax, {{played by}} Amy Ryan, {{who would go}} on to become Michael's main love interest. In fact, her return to the series in the seventh season was used by the writers as a way to write Steve Carell out of the series after his contract ended. Ryan gained prominence with her role as Beadie Russell on the HBO series The Wire. The writers of The Office, who were fans of the series, then approached Ryan about appearing in their show. Ryan, feeling that a comedy series would [...] "keep [...] a couple steps ahead of people [...] surprise people" [...] agreed. Holly's character was developed by the writers awhile before the episode was scripted. However, once Ryan began acting on set, Lieberstein explained that [...] "we started to see this really silly side that Amy brought to the character, and [...] found almost like a junior Michael in her. And we all saw it and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had." [...] After the filming of [...] "Goodbye, Toby", the writers were hoping that Ryan would return for the fifth season; the crew had not made a deal with her to film more episodes, but Lieberstein noted that [...] "we knew that she would stay around, or we hoped." [...] The episode also guest starred Melora Hardin, and Robert R. Shafer. The members of Darryl's band are the actual members of actor Craig Robinson's band: Chris Rob played bass, Asa Watkins played drums, and David Sampson played guitar.|$|E

Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely.

2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
