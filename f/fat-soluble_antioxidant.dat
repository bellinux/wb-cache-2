5000|$|Warmed-over flavor can be {{prevented}} {{by the addition of}} preservatives to processed meat. Many of the preservatives are antioxidants, ranging from tocopherols (related to vitamin E) to plum juice to industrial additives such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and propyl gallate. [...] Other preservatives such as sodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat. Nitrites, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin E {{refers to}} a group of {{compounds}} that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Of the many different forms of vitamin E, γ-tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet. γ-Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings. α-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet. This variant can be found most abundantly in wheat germ oil, sunflower, and safflower oils. As a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant,</b> it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products. Regular consumption of more than 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) of tocopherols per day may be expected to cause hypervitaminosis E, with an associated risk of vitamin K deficiency and consequently of bleeding problems.|$|E
5000|$|Tocotrienols, {{which are}} related compounds, also have vitamin E activity. All of these various {{derivatives}} with vitamin activity may correctly {{be referred to}} as [...] "vitamin E".

50|$|There are {{currently}} multiple theories explaining factors causing and affecting the cholesterol plaque build up within arteries {{with the most}} popular theory indicating {{that the rate of}} build up is affected by the oxidation of the LDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins with one of the physiological roles being lipid transportation. A typical LDL particle contain 2,700 fatty acid molecules and half of them are poly-unsaturated fatty acids, which are very oxidation sensitive. Once the oxidation of LDL occur, it will start a series of undesirable effects starting from the increase production of inflammatory cytokines by stimulating the endothelial cells and monocytes, followed by increased production of tissue factors, production of macrophages and monocytes, which eventually lead to the formation of foam cells and accelerated development of atherosclerosis. With the presence of adequate concentration of vitamin E, which is a very potent <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant,</b> it can inhibit the oxidation of LDL, and this inhibition contributes protection against the development of atherosclerosis and can stabilize the existing plaque.|$|E

Plant stanols dose-dependently decrease LDL-cholesterol concentrations, but not cholesterol-standardized <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> concentrations, at intakes up to 9 g/d 1 – 3 Ronald P Mensink, Arienne de Jong, Dieter Lütjohann, Guido RMM Haenen, and Jogchum Plat Background: It {{is unclear whether}} plant stanols lower serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol-standardized <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> concentrations dose-dependently when consumption ex-ceeds the recommended daily intakes of 2. 0 – 3. 0 g. Objective: The objective was to study the relation between plant stanols provided as plant stanol esters on changes in serum concen-trations of LDL cholesterol and fat-soluble antioxidants. Design: Healthy subjects (n 93) with slightly elevated serum total cholesterol concentrations (5. 0 – 8. 0 mmol/L) received, after a 3 -wk run-in period, control products (n 22) or products (margarine and soy-based yogurt) providing 3 g (n 24), 6 g (n 22), or 9 g (n 25) plant stanols provided as fatty acid esters for 4 wk. Results: Serum LDL cholesterol decreased dose-dependently. Com-pared with control, decreases in the 3 -g group were 0. 32 mmol/L (7. 4 %; P 0. 005 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). An intake of 6 g plant stanols caused an additional decrease of 0. 18 mmol/L (4. 5 %; P 0. 100 compared with the 3 -g group). In the 9 -g group, a further decrease of 0. 22 mmol/L (5. 4 %) was ob-served (P 0. 048 compared with the 6 -g group). Serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations were lowered by 17. 4 % in the 9 -g group compared with the control group. No effects on cholesterol-standardized b-carotene concentrations were observed. Even the change of 20. 01 lmol/mmol cholesterol (or 29. 2 %; P 0. 341) in the 3 -g group compared with the control group was not statisti-cally significant {{because of the large}} variation in response. Serum HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations, cholesterol-standardized a-tocopherol and lutein concentrations, and plasma markers reflecting liver and renal function were not affected. Conclusions: Daily consumption of plant stanols up to 9 g reduces serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations linearly up to 17. 4 %. For cholesterol-standardized <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> concentrations, such a relation could not be ascertained. Am J Clin Nutr 2010; 92 : 24 – 33...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress, i. e. {{excessive}} {{content of}} reactionary, oxygen, and nitrogen compounds (ROAC), including free radicals, {{is one of}} the causes of various dangerous diseases as well as premature aging. The adverse effect of free radicals can be neutralized by antioxidants. In order to carry out antioxidant therapy, one needs to know the contents of antioxidants in food products. We have created the databank for the contents of antioxidants in 1, 140 food products, beverages, etc. Apart from water-soluble <b>antioxidants,</b> <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> in dairy and fish products, cacao, chocolate, nuts etc. were determined for the first time using an amperometric method...|$|R
50|$|Antioxidants {{are often}} used as {{preservatives}} in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), TBHQ, propyl gallate and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.|$|R
40|$|Background: beta-Glucan {{can reduce}} serum {{concentrations}} of total and LDL cholesterol. The mechanism of this {{action is not}} clear, however, {{and it is difficult}} to predict the cholesterol-lowering effect of a food product enriched with beta-glucan. Objectives: We examined the effects of a beta-glucan-enriched fruit juice on serum lipids and lipoproteins and on markers of cholesterol absorption (serum concentrations of plant sterols) and synthesis (serum concentrations of lathosierol). In addition, we measured effects on lipid-soluble antioxidants. Design: After a 3 -wk run-in period, healthy subjects consumed daily a fruit drink providing 5 g rice starch [placebo (control) group; n = 22] or beta-glucan from oats (n = 25) for 5 wk (parallel design). At the end of the run-in period and at the end of the intervention, blood samples were taken for analysis of lipids and lipoproteins, noncholesterol sterols, and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants.</b> Changes between the end of the run-in period and the end of the intervention were calculated for each subject. Differences in changes between the groups were analyzed statistically. Results: The differences between the control and beta-glucan groups in the chance in serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, respectively, were - 4. 8 % (P = 0. 012) and - 7. 7 % (P = 0. 005). The differences between the groups in the change in serum concentrations of lathosterol and sitosterol were - 13 % (P = 0. 023) and - 11 % (P = 0. 030), respectively. No significant effects were found on <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants.</b> Conclusions: beta-Glucan lowers serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol when incorporated into a fruit drink. A reduced cholesterol absorption contributes to the cholesterol-lowering effect of beta-glucan without affecting plasma concentrations of lipid-soluble antioxidants...|$|R

3000|$|The {{antioxidant}} defense system, especial the enzymatic scavengers SOD, CAT and glutathione peroxidase, provides {{protection against}} potentially harmful ROS produced constantly during aerobic cell respiration (Lygren et al. 1999). SOD speeds {{the conversion of}} superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, whereas CAT and glutathione peroxidase convert hydrogen peroxide to water (Finkel and Holbrook 2000).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPancreatic {{insufficiency}} and {{a diminished}} bile acid pool cause malabsorption of important essential nutrients and other dietary components in cystic fibrosis (CF). Of particular significance is the malabsorption of <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> such as carotenoids, tocopherols and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10). Despite supplementation, CF patients are often deficient in these compounds, resulting in increased oxidative stress, which {{may contribute to}} adverse health effects. This pilot {{study was designed to}} evaluate the safety of a novel micellar formulation (CF- 1) of <b>fat-soluble</b> nutrients and <b>antioxidants</b> and to determine its efficacy in improving plasma levels of these compounds and reducing inflammatory markers in induced sputum. MethodsTen CF subjects, ages 8 to 45  years old, were given orally 10  ml of the CF- 1 formulation daily for 56  days after a 21 -day washout period in which subjects stopped supplemental vitamin use except for a standard multivitamin. Plasma obtained at − 3, 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 4, and 8  weeks was assayed for β-carotene, γ-tocopherol, retinol, and CoQ 10 as well as for safety parameters (comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count). In addition, pulmonary function was measured and induced sputum was assayed for markers of inflammation and quantitative bacterial counts both prior and during dosing. ResultsNo serious adverse effects, laboratory abnormalities or elevated nutrient levels (above normal) were identified as related to CF- 1. Supplementation with CF- 1 significantly increased β-carotene levels at all dosing time points when compared to screening and baseline. In addition, γ-tocopherol and CoQ 10 significantly increased from baseline in all subjects. Induced sputum myeloperoxidase significantly decreased and there was a trend toward decreases in PMN elastase and total cell counts with CF- 1. There was a significant inverse correlation between the antioxidant levels and induced sputum changes in IL- 8 and total neutrophils. Lung function and sputum bacterial counts were unchanged. ConclusionThe novel CF- 1 formulation safely and effectively increased plasma levels of important <b>fat-soluble</b> nutrients and <b>antioxidants.</b> In addition, improvements in antioxidant plasma levels were associated with reductions in airway inflammation in CF patients...|$|R
40|$|Chick {{viability}} {{is known}} to be an important factor determining profitability of the poultry industry. Chick embryo tissues contain a high proportion of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids in the lipid fraction and therefore need antioxidant defence. The antioxidant system of the developing embryo and newly hatched chick includes the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase), water-soluble antioxidants (ascorbic acid, taurine, carnitine, glutathione, etc.), <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> (vitamin E, carotenoids, coenzyme Q) as well as selenium (Se). In fact, the high levels of endogenous antioxidants within the egg and embryonic tissues can clearly serve as a major adaptive mechanism {{for the protection of the}} tissue during the oxidative stress experienced at hatching. It has been shown that among different nutrients in the maternal diet which could significantly affect chick embryo development and their viability in the early posthatch life, natural antioxidants have been suggested to play a central role. Our data indicate that increased supplementation of the maternal diet can substantially increase concentrations of vitamin E, carotenoids (especially canthaxanthin) and Se in developing chick tissues and significantly decrease susceptibility to lipid peroxidation being effective nutritional tools to deal with various commercial stresses in poultry production...|$|R
40|$|Abstractα-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an {{important}} <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> in biological systems and, {{as a result of}} scavenging reactive oxygen, it is converted to α-tocopherylquinone. α-Tocopherol binds to α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP) in the liver cytosol, whereas α-tocopherylquinone does not. We found that α-tocopherylquinone binds to a liver protein with a molecular mass of about 40 kDa that is distinct from αTTP. This α-tocopherylquinone binding protein was purified further by multiple-step column chromatography. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the final preparation yielded a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, which microsequencing revealed was identical to glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The GST activity was inhibited in the presence of α-tocopherylquinone, as it is by other non-substrate ligands for GST, confirming that GST and α-tocopherylquinone interact directly. α-Tocopherylquinone binds to GST and may be transported to the site of metabolism or excreted in the bile as other non-substrate ligands for GST...|$|E
30|$|Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is {{essential}} for maintaining the normal growth and metabolic function of fish. It acts as a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> in biological membranes {{and it has been}} demonstrated to be an essential nutrient for all fish studied (NRC 1993). As well as, its main function is to protect unsaturated fatty acids against free radical-mediated oxidation (Hamre et al. 1998). In addition to that, high dietary supplementation of vitamins E showed positive effects on growth and immune response in channel catfish (Li et al. 1993). Several studies have been carried out on the effect of different fungicides on hematological and biochemical aspects of fish and other aquatic animals, but very few on its amelioration through dietary vitamin E. Considering the commercial value of O. niloticus, it is necessary to obtain scientific information about the effect of copperoxychloride on O. niloticus to improve risk-assessment studies and its attenuation with the help of dietary vitamin E. This study aimed to assess the effect of the sublethal concentration of copperoxychloride over a long exposure period (90  days) on growth, hematological, histological and biochemical parameters of O. niloticus and its amelioration through a gradient of dietary vitamin E.|$|E
40|$|The cancer {{preventive}} {{activity of}} vitamin E {{has been suggested}} by many epidemiological studies. However, several recent large-scale human trials with α-tocopherol, the most commonly recognized and used form of vitamin E, failed to demonstrate a cancer preventive effect. The recently finished follow-up of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) even showed higher prostate cancer incidence in subjects who took α-tocopherol supplementation. The scientific community {{and the general public}} are faced with a question “Does vitamin E prevent or promote cancer? ” Our recent results in animal models have demonstrated the cancer preventive activity of γ- and δ-tocopherols as well as a naturally occurring mixture of tocopherols, and the lack of cancer preventive activity by α-tocopherol. Based on these results as well as information from the literature, we suggest that vitamin E, as ingested in the diet or in supplements that are rich in γ- and δ-tocopherols, is cancer preventive; whereas supplementation with high doses of α-tocopherol is not.

Cytokine response in LPS-treated mice was analysed in tandem with the following parameters: the synthesis of inducible forms of the heat shock proteins HSP 72 and HSP 90 α; activity of the NF-κB and SAPK/JNK signalling pathways; and TLR 4 expression. Inflammation-bearing Balb/c male mice were pretreated with an inhibitor of IKK-α/β kinases (IKK Inhibitor XII); with thymulin; with dietary coenzyme Q 9, α-tocopherol, and β-carotene; or with combinations of the inhibitor and peptide or antioxidants. Comparable anti-inflammatory effects were observed in inflammation-bearing mice treated separately with thymulin or with dietary antioxidants administered daily for two weeks before LPS treatment. When LPS-injected mice were treated with the inhibitor and antioxidants together, neither plasma cytokines, signal proteins, nor heat shock proteins recovered more efficiently than when mice were treated with these agents separately. In contrast to antioxidant diet, the thymulin was shown to increase the effect of IKK Inhibitor XII in preventing IKK activation in LPS-treated mice...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> that is {{transported by}} plasma {{lipoprotein}}s in the body. α-Tocopherol {{taken up by}} the liver with lipoprotein is thought to be resecreted into the plasma in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). α-Tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which was recently identified as a product of the causative gene for familial isolated vitamin E deficiency, is a cytosolic liver protein and {{plays an important role in}} the efficient recycling of plasma vitamin E. To throw light on the mechanism of αTTP-mediated α-tocopherol transfer in the liver cell, we devised an assay system using the hepatoma cell line McARH 7777. Using this system, we found that the secretion of α-tocopherol was more efficient in cells expressing αTTP than in matched cells lacking αTTP. Brefeldin A, which effectively inhibits VLDL secretion by disrupting the Golgi apparatus, had no effect on α-tocopherol secretion, indicating that αTTP-mediated α-tocopherol secretion is not coupled to VLDL secretion. Among other agents tested, only 25 -hydroxycholesterol, a modulator of cholesterol metabolism, inhibited α-tocopherol secretion. This inhibition is most likely mediated by oxysterol-binding protein. These results suggest that αTTP present in the liver cytosol functions to stimulate secretion of cellular α-tocopherol into the extracellular medium and that the reaction utilizes a novel non-Golgi-mediated pathway that may be linked to cellular cholesterol metabolism and/or transport...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dietary {{carotenoids}} {{have attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention due to their potential clinical relevance in conditions such as age-related maculopathy, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Surgical procedures have become the primary treatment of severe obesity, although nutrient deficiencies are common and long-term metabolic sequelae remain unknown. Thus, our aim was to assess the carotenoid status in serum of subjects after obesity surgery. Methods: We evaluated the status of lutein, zeaxanthin, α- and β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, α- and β-carotene, and fat-soluble vitamins by a quality-controlled high-performance liquid chromatography method in serum of 53 patients. Subjects were consecutively included as they were monitored for nutritional status after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). Average follow-up time was 18 and 14 months for each protocol, respectively. Results: After obesity surgery, a consistent and continuous decline in all carotenoids to almost undetectable levels occurs, especially in those who underwent BPD diversion who, on average, displayed serum levels about one half to one third of those found in RYGBP patients. Conclusion: The hypocarotenemia observed after bariatric surgery may compromise the availability of carotenoids to tissues and the vitamin A status, reducing the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> capacity and constituting an additional risk factor for several clinical conditions. Given the emerging role of carotenoids in disease prevention, dietary advice on carotenoid-rich and fortified foods or the use of supplements in these patients should be considered. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Background: Blood lipids can {{influence}} <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> concentrations and confound their interpretation {{as indicators of}} antioxidant intake status and disease risk. Objectives: The objectives were to identify lipoproteins that can confound the interpretation of serum fat-soluble antioxidants, to evaluate {{the amount of the}} confounding, and to recommend a method for standardizing blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants. Design: Several methods of lipid standardization of fat-soluble antioxidants were evaluated in a large cohort of young adults with the use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data analysis. Results: Tocopherol and carotenoid concentrations were associ-ated with plasma total cholesterol and its components, LDL, HDL, and VLDL cholesterol (estimated as plasma total triacylglycerols/ 5), some of which were independent predictors for all of the fat-soluble antioxidants. Among supplement nonusers, the most amphipathic (polar) of the antioxidants (-tocopherol, -tocopherol, and zeaxanthin plus lutein) and lycopene were associated strongly with these lipid fractions (R 2 = 0. 09, 0. 40). Consistent with a causal association in which blood antioxidant concentrations change as blood lipid concentrations change, similar relations were found for changes in blood antioxidant and lipid concentra-tions over a 7 -y period. Concentrations of the remaining carotenoids (-cryptoxanthin, -carotene, and -carotene) had a weaker association with plasma lipoproteins (R 2 < 0. 06). Similar relations were found for supplement users. Conclusions: The simultaneous adjustment of the concentrations of tocopherols, zeaxanthin plus lutein, and lycopene for VLDL, HDL, and LDL cholesterol is recommended. This method is practical and can provide a basis for the standardization of carotenoid and tocopherol concentrations. Am J Clin Nutr 2003; 77 : 458 – 66.

A perplexing and unanswered question is whether low cholesterol is causally related to nonatherosclerotic disease risk. Cholesterol is reduced during the acute phase reaction; a state of immune activation that persists for more than 5 years may explain the prospective observations. Higher cholesterol may be a marker for other protective substances such as <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants.</b> Low cholesterol might mark poor nutrition, for example, during depression.

40|$|Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{extensively}} consumed vegetable crops worldwide and is consequently fulfilling a key role in the human diet. Tomato constitutes an excellent source of health-promoting compounds including several antioxidants such as the carotenoids lycopene and β-carotene and the vitamins ascorbate and α-tocopherol. Within this research the effect of salinity level on antioxidant content of tomato fruits was verified. To evaluate the effect of applied salinity treatments, chemical-analytical procedures for the quantification of the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> lycopene, β-carotene and α-tocopherol were optimized. The optimized extraction procedure was based on liquid-liquid partition and made use of ethanol and hexane. Although in previous papers mainly classical HPLC was used for chromatographic separation, in this study U-HPLC (equipped with a Hypersil GOLD column, 100 x 2. 1 mm, 1. 9 μm) was preferred. With this technique a significant reduction in analysis time from in general 45 minutes to only 6 minutes was achieved without any loss of chromatographic resolution. In comparison with the frequently used UV-VIS detectors, the usage of a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer allowed a more certain identification of target analytes, due to the higher selectivity. Optimized procedures were applied on tomato fruits, exposed to one of four salinity treatments (2. 5, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 8. 0 dS/m). Average concentration levels for lycopene, β-carotene and α-tocopherol were 50. 02, 1. 23 and 2. 67 mg/kg respectively. Although certain trends could be identified, significant differences were not detectable. Although the chemical-analytical procedures were successfully optimized and applied, the time consuming and labour intensive features of the extraction procedure were identified as major drawbacks. Therefore a new extraction procedure, based on the recent developed in-tube solid-phase micro extraction, will be optimized. This technique makes use of an extraction column and requires only small amounts of sample and is less solvent consuming...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects of free access to reduced fat {{products}} or their full fat equivalents on fat and energy intake, body weight, plasma lipids and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants</b> concentrations and haemostasis variables. Design: A multicentre open randomised controlled trial in which intervention and control groups were followed in parallel for six months. Volunteers had free access to 44 different foods either in reduced fat or full fat version, covering between 30 and 40 % of energy intake. The remainder of energy intake was covered by foods bought in regular shops. Setting: Zeist, Wageningen and Maastricht, The Netherlands. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-one non-obese healthy volunteers who had no intention to lose weight. Main outcome measures: Food intake, body weight, plasma lipid, vitamin E, β-carotene, lycopene and fibrinogen concentrations, plasma factor VII clotting activity, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-I antigen level. Results: One hundred and three volunteers in the full fat group and 117 volunteers in the reduced fat group completed the study. Energy and fat intake from the free access products was lower in the reduced fat group, but no difference in energy and fat intake of other products occurred. Body weight, energy-, fat- and vitamin E intake and percentage of energy derived from fat decreased in the reduced fat group. No other statistical significant intervention effects were observed. Blood lipid concentrations, factor VII activity and plasminogen-inhibitor-activator- 1 level were reduced after consumption of reduced fat products. Conclusions: When subjects without intention to lose weight limit fat intake by switching from ad libitum consumption of full fat products to reduced fat products body weight gain is prevented, and fat and energy intake are reduced. Such a switch may have beneficial effects on biochemical cardiovascular risk factors. We concluded that reduced fat products will help in a population strategy aimed at preventing overweight and obesity, they will also be effective in maintaining a lower body weight after slimming. Ad libitum consumption of reduced fat products will be ineffective for those individuals that want to reduce body weight because they are currently overweight or obese. Sponsorship: Unilever...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Free radicals, {{oxidative}} stress and their possible consequences for health {{are becoming increasingly}} important in modern medicine. Reactive species influence the organism, potentially causing oxidative cell damage. They can be produced by exogenous sources, or be {{a product of a}} variety of not only physiological metabolic processes, such as immune response, but also pathological processes. The antioxidant protection system protects the organism from oxidative damage caused by reactions producing an excess of free radicals. The analysis of antioxidant potential (AOP) is therefore becoming increasingly important for the diagnosis of individual vitality. Method: The photochemoluminescence method was used to measure the AOP in urine and saliva, spectrometry was employed to measure the β-carotene content of the skin. In addition, it was investigated whether the AOPsaliva correlated with the AOPUurine (uric-acid independent AOP) as well as the β-carotene content of the skin. Results: The AOP was significantly higher in urine than in saliva, and both values were significantly positively correlated with each other. However, there was no significant correlation to the β-carotene content of the skin. Discussion: The components of the AOPUurine are accumulated over time (night), whereas AOP measurement in saliva is like a snapshot, which explains why AOPUurine was significantly higher than AOPsaliva, although the two parameters are correlated with each other. β-carotene is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant,</b> whereas in our study, only water-soluble antioxidants were determined in the urine. This explains why there is no positive correlation between β-carotene of the skin and AOP. Conclusion: For the characterization of the AOP in epidemiological studies, we recommend determining the AOPUurine and parallel to this, the β-carotene content of the skin...|$|E
40|$|Bakery {{products}} enriched with phytosterol esters, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene decrease plasma LDL-cholesterol {{and maintain}} plasma beta-carotene concentrations in normocholesterolemic men and women. The hypocholesterolemic effects of phytosterols {{have not been}} evaluated in bakery products, {{and the addition of}} liposoluble antioxidants to the carrier has never been tested. We investigated the effects of consuming croissants and magdalenas (Spanish muffins) enriched with sterol esters, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on plasma lipid and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> concentrations in normocholesterolemic, habitual consumers of bakery products following their usual diet and lifestyle. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the control (C) group (n = 29) received two pieces daily (standard croissant and muffin) and the sterol ester (SE) group (n = 28), the same products with sterol esters added (3. 2 g/d) for 8 wk. Total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased in the SE group by 0. 24 mmol/L (P < 0. 01) and 0. 26 mmol/L (P < 0. 005), respectively, whereas these variables did not change in the control group. The total difference in total and LDL-C changes between groups was 0. 38 mmol/L (8. 9 %) and 0. 36 mmol/L (14. 7 %), respectively (P < 0. 001). Within-group changes in HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol or lipoprotein(a) concentrations did not differ. Similarly, within-group changes over time in plasma tocopherol and carotenoid concentrations did not differ between groups. Our findings suggest that bakery products are excellent carriers for phytosterols, and their consumption is associated with a decrease in total and LDL-C concentrations, with no changes in alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene. The ability of bakery products to include sufficient quantities of beta-carotene to compensate for a potential deficiency, and the fact that their efficacy was not associated with the time of day at which they were consumed, are interesting findings...|$|E
40|$|Although dietary marine {{phospholipids}} {{are able}} to improve culture performance of marine fish larvae in a further extend than soybean lecithin, both types of phospholipids (PL) markedly increase oxidative risk. The inclusion of a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidant</b> such as the vitamin E -tocopherol could allow a better control of oxidative stress. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the combined effect of graded levels of -tocopherol with different levels and sources of krill phospholipids (KPL) and soybean lecithin (SBL) on growth, survival, resistance to stress, oxidative status, bone metabolism-related genes expression and biochemical composition of sea bream larvae. Sea bream larvae were completely weaned at 16 dph and fed for 30 days seven microdiets with three different levels of PL (0, 40 and 80 g kg- 1 diet) and two of -tocopherol 1500 and 3000 mg kg- 1 diet. Sea bream larvae fed diets without PL supplementation showed the lowest survival, growth and stress resistance, whereas increase in PL, particularly KPL, markedly promoted larval survival and growth. However, feeding SBL markedly increased TBARs and GPX gene expression increasing the peroxidation risk in the larvae. Besides, KPL inclusion improved incorporation of n- 3 HUFA and, particularly, EPA into larval tissues, these fatty acids being positively correlated with the expression of BMP- 4, RUNX 2, ALP, OC and OP genes and to bone mineralization for a given larval size class. The increase in dietary -tocopherol tends to improve growth in relation to the n- 3 HUFA levels in the diet, denoting the protective role of this vitamin against oxidation. Indeed, dietary -tocopherol decreased the oxidative stress in the larvae as denoted by the reduction in larval TBARs contents and gene expression of SOD and CAT, but not GPX. Thus, increase in dietary -tocopherol effectively prevented the formation of free radicals from HUFA, particularly EPA, but did not affect the incidence of bone anomalies or the expression of genes related to osteogenetic processes...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of {{lipophilic}} vitamins {{in clinical}} or biological samples {{is very important}} from the medical, epidemiological and informational points of view. Adequate dietary intake of nutrients such as vitamin A (retinol) and vitamin E (tocopherol) is essential for normal development and health maintenance [1]. The simultaneous analysis of vitamins A, E and coenzyme Q 10 are reported as a profile of fat-soluble vitamins. Decreased concentrations of these principal molecules can reveal {{the need for an}} increased dietary intake [2]. Simultaneous determination of these compounds in biological samples (plasma, serum, tissues and plant material) appears to be difficult due to their liability to photooxidation, presence of cis- and trans-isomers and their diverse polar structures [3]. In this regard, the aim of our study was to assay the plasmatic profile of the <b>fat-soluble</b> (lipophylic) <b>antioxidant</b> micronutrients (all-trans-retinol, α-tocopherol, coenzime Q 10) of diabetic and obese patients using a specific method for their simultaneous quantification, namely HPLC with UV detection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cancer {{patients}} experience {{weight loss}} {{for a variety}} of reasons, commencing with the tumor’s metabolism (Warburg effect) and proceeding via cachexia to loss of appetite. In pancreatic cancer, several other factors are involved, including a loss of appetite with a particular aversion to meat and the incapacity of the pancreatic gland to function normally when a tumor is present in the pancreatic head. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency of the enzymes secreted from the pancreas due to the obstructive tumor, resulting in maldigestion. This, in turn, contributes to malnutrition, specifically a lack of <b>fat-soluble</b> vitamins, <b>antioxidants,</b> and other micronutrients. Patients with pancreatic cancer and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency have, overall, an extremely poor prognosis with regard to surgical outcome and overall survival. Therefore, it is crucial {{to be aware of the}} mechanisms involved in the disease, to be able to diagnose pancreatic exocrine insufficiency early on, and to treat malnutrition appropriately, for example, with pancreatic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk can {{be lowered}} by {{introduction}} of plant sterols (PS) in the diet, since PS {{have been shown}} to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Given that the efficacy of PS as cholesterol-lowering agents depends on their appropriate solubilization, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PS in non-traditional matrices needs to be determined. The primary aim of this thesis was to examine the consumption of PS (a) in an oil rich in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) or (b) low-fat yogurt with or without a meal, on changes in lipid parameters. Additional objectives were: (1) to assess the effects of MCT with PS on body composition and energetics, (2) to compare the effects of PS in low-fat matrix consumed with or without a meal on cholesterol synthesis, (3) to evaluate the risks of PS in low-fat matrix on blood levels of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamin, and (4) to investigate the relationship between the response to PS, cholesterol kinetics and genotyping. For this purpose two randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trials were conducted. First, 23 overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed PS in MCT or olive oil control for six weeks each. In the second trial, 26 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a placebo yogurt, a PS-enriched yogurt consumed with a meal, or afternoon PS-enriched yogurt as a snack for four weeks each. PS, mixed within a MCT matrix, lower plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C without changing the high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. However, no changes in body composition or energetics were observed. Secondly, a PS-enriched low-fat yogurt as snack lowered TC, along with a lowering trend in LDL-C, to greater extent compared to when consumed with a meal without any risk of deficiency in <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>antioxidants.</b> An increase in cholesterol biosynthesis was also observed in both PS phases compared to control phase. In addition, three non-responsive subjects to PS intervention who had higher cholesterol absorption rates were observed; however, no recognizable pattern of genetic polymorphisms was detected. Overall, these novel matrices for PS incorporation consumed with or between meals may be an effective way of decreasing the risk of CVD; however, some individuals respond better to PS intervention...|$|R
