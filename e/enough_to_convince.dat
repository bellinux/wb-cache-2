5|$|Several {{supporters}} of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the government to {{back down on the}} web filtering policy and called for violence. Others disagreed with such actions and proposed launching an additional attack on a popular government site. A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the state selectors and Harvey {{did not get a}} recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E
5|$|Milne's form at Bristol City was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson that he {{was still}} worth a {{contract}} with a top-flight club. In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £170,000 deal. Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United, but had seen his side finish second in the league the previous season and now they were on a winless run in the league that saw them mid-table. He put Milne on the left-wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E

5000|$|After recuperating for one season, he felt healthy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{return to}} {{baseball}} with Cincinnati in 1996. He {{had a solid}} season with a [...]287 average and 26 home runs, although injuries cut into his playing time. He had played well <b>enough,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Baltimore <b>to</b> sign him as a free agent.|$|R
5|$|Playford also {{successfully}} coaxed Chrysler {{to stay in}} Adelaide {{and expand}} its operations. The Housing Trust sold the Tonsley Park where the car manufacturing plant was set up, and helped to install railyards, electricity and water infrastructure there, as it had done at Elizabeth. By the time Playford left office, Holden and Chrysler employed around 11,000 workers, 11% of the state's manufacturing employees. After earlier failed attempts to bring a tyre factory to Adelaide, the plans to build the Port Stanvac oil refinery—which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber—in the early 1960s were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> both a Dunlop Rubber-Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills (later Bridgestone Australia) to start manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches {{and to try to}} weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Vainio ran 10,000 metres in 28:02.04 at the Bislett Games, {{but that}} was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Finnish Olympic Committee, and he was not picked for the Olympics anymore.|$|E
50|$|After {{their initial}} {{reluctance}} Greenpeace embraced {{the result of}} the popular vote and used the name at the center of its campaign. The added publicity, at no cost to Greenpeace, gave it <b>enough</b> impact <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Japanese government, and the plan to hunt Humpback whales was abandoned in December 2007.|$|R

60|$|After that he {{mentioned}} her no more. He {{knew that in}} his indolent way Lionel could be headstrong, and he knew human nature well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>convinced</b> that interference here would but set up a breach between himself and his brother without in the least achieving its real object. So Oliver shrugged re-signedly, and held his peace.|$|R
25|$|Sadler {{must have}} {{provided}} some very persuasive evidence to his interrogators in the Tower, sufficient {{not only to}} secure his own release, but <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the king to question his late chief minister's fate.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} {{generated by}} the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 {{and the potential for}} financial rewards were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the authorities to play all three games under state of origin rules the following year.|$|E
25|$|Jenner's {{understanding}} of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed, until the artist Jemima Blackburn, a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

50|$|Around 1541 {{he found}} his friend Alonso de Fuenmayor {{in the city of}} Pasto and went into {{business}} raising pigs. He was very successful with this venture. He went to Cali and found buyers for a herd of sheep he had brought from the south and got <b>enough</b> money <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Benalcazar <b>to</b> name him Governor and General Captain of Nevia and of the Pijao and Panchen Indians.|$|R
50|$|Aaron is sure he {{has finally}} found Rademacher in the United States, living under the name Robert Greene—but is unable <b>to</b> find <b>enough</b> {{evidence}} <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the authorities <b>to</b> prosecute Greene. Aaron confronts the man himself and angrily denounces him as a war criminal with little success. Greene insists {{that he is not}} Rademacher, but—realizing that he has been found—makes plans to leave for Argentina to avoid any possible prosecution.|$|R
25|$|Harris' {{emphasis}} (and threat) of {{the inevitable}} {{defeat of the}} resisting Japanese by the British and the French was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> many of the kaikoku members of the Tokugawa Shogunate {{to agree to the}} terms of the United States, no matter how unfavorable they were. The memory of China's overwhelming defeat was too close to be ignored.|$|E
25|$|Late Monday evening, Court of Queen’s Bench Justice John Rooke found AUPE in {{contempt}} of court for the illegal strike, stating the union had not done <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> their members to return to work. A $100,000 fine was levied against the union, with the fine increasing in substantial increments until the strike ended.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 the new Honda powered BAR {{did show}} a {{significant}} improvement. It {{proved to be}} considerably more reliable than the team's previous effort, but the team still only had a best finish of 4th and the victory they had promised in 1999 still eluded them. At {{the end of the}} season the team finished 5th in the Constructors' Championship. The progression and improvement of the team was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Villeneuve to remain at the team.|$|E
50|$|Carr had a fright in his {{qualification}} for the Olympics. He {{had won the}} semi-final trials held in New York in July {{and only}} had to prove his fitness at the final trials in September in Los Angeles. However, he was well beaten into fourth place in the final there and with only 3 to qualify {{he could have been}} eliminated. His earlier win was <b>enough</b> though <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the selectors that he should go to the Olympics.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, they {{finished}} in 7th {{place in the}} German version of the Got Talent franchise: Das Supertalent.The German judges found Attraction very creative, though they also said that Attraction could do more with their talent. Their black light performance did not have <b>enough</b> power <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Germans of letting them pass on to the finals. Judge Thomas Gottschalk {{said he had never}} seen anything quite like this and that he was stunned by their performance.|$|R
50|$|In many episodes, the {{identity}} of the guilty party is uncovered without an actual trial being held. Instead, this occurs at the preliminary hearing stage, in which the district attorney is required <b>to</b> produce just <b>enough</b> evidence <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the judge that the defendant should be bound over for trial. During this stage, other malefactors — such as blackmailers, frauds, and forgers — are frequently forced into confessions by Mason's relentless and clever questioning, and the killer is exposed.|$|R
25|$|MacGill {{kept his}} {{spot in the}} side when they {{returned}} home for an Ashes series, again finishing as Australia's most successful bowler with 27 wickets at 17.70. His tally included his then career best innings figures of 7 for 50, made in the 5th Test at Sydney. He took a total of 12 wickets in that match and had done <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the selectors to use two spinners for their tour of the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|Railtrack {{shareholders}} formed {{two groups}} {{to press for}} increased compensation. A lawyer speaking {{for one of those}} groups remarked on GMTV that his strategy was to sue the government for incorrect and misleading information given at the time Railtrack was created, when John Major was Conservative Prime Minister. An increased offer of up to 262p per share was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the larger shareholder group, the Railtrack Action Group, to abandon legal action. The Chairman, Usman Mahmud, believed that legal action would not be successful without the support of management and major shareholders.|$|E
25|$|In 1879 the Lever family {{business}} acquired a failing wholesale grocer in Wigan, affording young William {{an opportunity to}} prove his ability as a quasi-autonomous administrator. The expanded activity necessitated a search for new suppliers, taking William to Ireland, France {{and other parts of}} Europe, appointing local agents to safeguard the firm’s interests. At this time, his flair for advertising and branding began to emerge as he successfully differentiated the Lever brand from generic commodities. By the end of 1879, the business’ prospects were good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> William and Elizabeth to invest in a new home in Bolton and by 1881 the expanding Wigan business warranted the commissioning of new premises; Lever and Company was expanding steadily.|$|E
50|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a Polish Resistance group which discovers details of the {{manufacture}} of the German V-1 'Flying Bomb' at Peenemünde in 1943. Liaising with service chiefs in London, the group manage <b>to</b> pass on <b>enough</b> information <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> them <b>to</b> launch a bombing raid and, in the climax to the film, are able to steal a V-1 which lands in a field during testing and arrange for its transport back to Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|This domain {{recorded}} <b>enough</b> traffic numbers <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Mark <b>to</b> {{return to}} Nigeria from Germany. In Calabar, {{he continued to}} list more hotels. He partnered with a friend and they started taking photographs of hotels and signing agreements with as many hotels in Calabar as they could find.|$|R
25|$|The {{genesis of}} A Bay of Blood {{was a simple}} story idea concocted by Bava and actress Laura Betti {{as a way to}} allow them to work {{together}} again, as the two had got along so well on Bava's Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1969). The project's original title was Odore di carne ("stench of flesh"), and the murder-filled story had <b>enough</b> promise <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> producer Giuseppe Zaccariello to provide financial backing. Numerous other writers, including Zaccariello himself, had their hands involved in devising the final screenplay.|$|R
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E
25|$|Baum wrote a new Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz, {{with a view}} {{to making}} it into a stage production, which was titled The Woggle-Bug, but Montgomery and Stone balked at {{appearing}} when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of Ozma of Oz, which eventually became The Tik-Tok Man Of Oz. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> producer Oliver Morosco to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz, but this was ultimately realized as a film.|$|E
25|$|I return herewith, under {{separate}} cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it {{is hardly}} necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they are all very similar in character. Joseph Smith's interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum should be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.|$|E
6000|$|There was a look, a start, {{an exclamation}} on hearing this, which {{astonished}} Sir Thomas; {{but what was}} his increase of astonishment on hearing her exclaim--"Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to him. Mr. Crawford ought to know--he must know that: I told him <b>enough</b> yesterday <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday, and I told him without disguise {{that it was very}} disagreeable to me, and quite out of my power to return his good opinion." ...|$|R
50|$|The epic {{deals with}} two white horses owned by Genghis Khan. The younger one feels their {{services}} for the ruler are not being appreciated <b>enough,</b> and tries <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the older one to move away together. The older one is reluctant, but after the younger one runs away on his own, the older one follows.|$|R
60|$|The scene amused him. He {{was deeply}} {{interested}} in Alec's attitude, for he knew him well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>convinced</b> that his discreet gaiety was entirely assumed. It {{was impossible to}} tell by it what course he meant to adopt; {{and at the same time}} there was about him a greater unapproachableness, which warned all and sundry that it would be wiser to attempt no advance. But for his own part he did not care; he meant to have a word with Alec at the first opportunity.|$|R
