5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> <b>story</b> from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
25|$|In mid-December, Colonel Breytenbach's brother Cloete, a {{journalist}} for The Sunday Times, arrived in South West Africa to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on the war. He requested {{an opportunity to}} see the operational area and was permitted to photograph 32 Battalion in action as long as he refrained from publishing the unit's name or any details of its deployment. Cloete received his opportunity on 23 December, when an SADF supply convoy spotted suspicious tracks entering Ovamboland. A 32 Battalion member, Tony Viera, followed the tracks two kilometres into Angola and observed seven insurgents mingling with civilians north of Chapa Lupale. His platoon deployed around the fringe of the settlement and crawled to within seventy metres of the guerrillas. In the ensuing firefight six of the seven were shot dead. Cloete Breytenbach published an exclusive report on the action when he returned to Johannesburg. This {{was the first time that}} 32 Battalion had been publicly photographed.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban. For much of the show's fifth season, Shiban had an index card that simply read [...] "Mulder Undercover". He had long wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> like this, noting, [...] "It always seemed to fit to me—putting Mulder in a {{situation}} [...] don't know his allegiance." [...] Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season. Shiban petitioned Frank Spotnitz several times about the idea until [...] "the right time and the right way" [...] presented itself.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{inspired}} while White was filming The Restorers, after a P-51C Mustang landed for refueling and White met Doug Rozendaal, {{the pilot of}} the Red Tail Project's Tuskegee Airmen plane. [...] When White heard Don Hinz {{had been killed in}} a crash of that very same plane, he felt compelled to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> focusing on it. Once he got involved in the project, a local PBS station committed to airing the final product, which was an early step in the successful development of the project. [...] When researching the film he noticed a lack of resources about the Tuskegee Airmen and felt driven to fill the void.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer B. J. Novak, who also portrays Ryan Howard on the show. It was directed by Tucker Gates, his fourth directing credit of the series. Michael's screenplay for Threat Level Midnight was the subplot for second season episode [...] "The Client", and had subsequently been referenced to in [...] "Email Surveillance", [...] "Product Recall", [...] "Money", [...] "Dinner Party", and [...] "Prince Family Paper". The idea for the episode came from series' star Steve Carell, who was leaving the show {{at the end of}} the season. He said that he enjoyed the idea behind the [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] script and wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> centered on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for [...] "Fight Club" [...] was a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] that series creator Chris Carter had thought up a while back. He explained, [...] "I had this {{idea for a}} long time to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." [...] Carter began to write the episode at the same time as the pilot for the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen. Because of the [...] "insanity" [...] in juggling two scripts at once, many more [...] "crazy" [...] elements made it into [...] "Fight Club". When executive producer Frank Spotnitz first looked at the script, he noted that [...] " [...] had an odd tone. It felt like a wild show." ...|$|E

500|$|Stone pursued {{other films}} of his own, Chernin was {{replaced}} by Thomas Rothman, and a drunken Sellers crashed his car, killing a much-loved colleague and earning jail time, while producers Murphy and Hamsher were paid off. [...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate {{a lot of material}} [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued. [...] "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, {{but a lot of the}} stuff in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{issue that}} {{attracted}} much attention, {{both positive and}} negative, was G.I. Joe #21, titled [...] "Silent Interlude", which was told entirely without words or sound effects. In a 1987 interview, Hama explained that the motivation for the story was that he [...] "... {{wanted to see if}} [...] could <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that was a real, complete story—beginning, middle, end, conflict, characterization, action, solid resolution—without balloons or captions or sound effects." [...] At first, the issue was controversial; some readers felt cheated that it had no words and could be [...] "read" [...] so quickly. However, it eventually became one of the series' most enduring and influential issues. Issue #21 has been recognized as a modern comic classic, and has become a prime example of comics' visual storytelling power. Comic book artist and theorist Scott McCloud (author of Understanding Comics) describes [...] "Silent Interlude" [...] as [...] "... a kind of watershed moment for cartoonists of [...] generation. Everyone remembers it. All these things came out of it. It was like 9/11." [...] The issue would eventually be ranked #44 in Wizard Magazine's listing of the [...] "100 Best Single Issues Since You Were Born", and #6 on io9's [...] "10 Issues of Ongoing Comics that Prove Single Issues Can Be Great." ...|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make you really feel you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job, and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about it for a while, Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E

The episode's plot originated from the writers wanting to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> where it seemed as though a major character had died.

2500|$|Its first glimmer {{occurred}} {{some two}} years previously, in August 1944, over lunch between Hitchcock and Selznick's story editor, Margaret McDonell.

Her training would be as elaborate as the training of a Mata Hari." [...] Hitchcock continued his conversation a few weeks later, this time dining at Chasen's with William Dozier, an RKO studio executive, and pitching it as [...] "the story of a woman sold for political purposes into sexual enslavement." [...] By this time, he had one of the single-word titles he preferred: Notorious. The pitch was convincing: Dozier quickly entered into talks with Selznick, offering to buy the property and its personnel for production at RKO.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 September 2006, Robson and a Today Tonight {{crew were}} {{detained}} by Indonesian authorities in Papua for working as journalists despite {{entering the country}} on tourist visas.

2500|$|The festival has {{continued}} ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II), and quickly {{developed a reputation}} for quality productions. Angus Bowmer’s first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the festival from 1935 to 1940 years. In 1939, OSF took a production of The Taming of the Shrew to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning {{at the last minute}} the broadcast would be to a national audience, [...] suffered a panic attack, {{was rushed to the hospital}} and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn’t arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations and, after 1954 on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable review from critics and for the first time people began to come from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining the mystery of how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
