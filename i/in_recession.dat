An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} why {{fiscal policy}} becomes more effective as unemployment rises <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> The theory {{is based on}} the equilibrium unemployment model of Michaillat (forthcoming), in which jobs are rationed <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> Fiscal policy takes the form of government spending on public-sector jobs. Recessions are periods of acute job shortage without much competition for workers among recruiting firms; hiring in the public sector does not crowd out hiring in the private sector much; therefore fiscal policy reduces unemployment effectively. Formally the fiscal multiplier—the reduction in unemployment rate achieved by spending one dollar on public-sector jobs—is countercyclical. An implication is that available estimates of the fiscal multiplier, which measure the average effect of fiscal policy over the business cycle, do not apply <b>in</b> <b>recessions</b> because the multiplier is much higher <b>in</b> <b>recessions</b> than on average.

25|$|Inflation {{continued}} to be a major problem afflicting the New Zealand economy. Between 1985 and 1992, inflation averaged 9% per year and the economy was <b>in</b> <b>recession.</b> The unemployment rate rose from 3.6% to 11%, New Zealand's credit rating dropped twice, and foreign debt quadrupled. In 1989 the Reserve Bank Act 1989 was passed, creating strict monetary policy under the sole control of the Reserve Bank Governor. From then on the Reserve Bank focused on keeping inflation low and stable, using the Official Cash Rate (OCR) – the price of borrowing money in New Zealand – as its primary means to do so. As a result, inflation rates fell to an average of 2.5% in the 1990s, compared to 12% in the 1970s. However, the tightening of monetary policy contributed to rising unemployment in the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{research}} has shown that, once the long-term declining trends are excluded, mortality rates in industrial countries tend to rise in economic expansions and fall <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> <b>In</b> the present work the comovements between economic fluctuations and mortality changes in postwar Japan are investigated by analyzing time series of mortality rates and eight economic indicators.

As previously found in other industrial economies, in Japan general mortality and age-specific death rates tend to increase in expansions and drop <b>in</b> <b>recessions,</b> both for males and females. The effect is slightly stronger for males, and particularly noticeable in those aged 45 – 64. Deaths attributed to heart disease, pneumonia, accidents, liver disease, and senility, making up about 41 % of total mortality, tend to fluctuate procyclically, increasing in expansions. Suicides, and deaths attributed to diabetes and hypertensive disease, making up about 4 % of total mortality, fluctuate countercyclically, increasing <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> Deaths attributed to other causes, making up about half of total deaths, don’t show a clearly defined relationship with the fluctuations of the economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{opposite}} {{should occur}} <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> 1 <b>In</b> practice, {{in many developing}} countries fiscal policy has the opposite properties: it is procyclical. In particular, government spending as a share of GDP goes up during booms and down <b>in</b> <b>recessions,</b> and deficits increase in booms and decrease <b>in</b> <b>recessions.</b> <b>In</b> OECD countries, in contrast, fiscal policy is generally countercyclical. 2 Gavin and Perotti (1997) were the first to point out that in Latin America fiscal policy is procyclical; then Talvi and Vegh (2005), Catão and Sutton (2002), Manasse (2005), and Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) noted {{that this is not a}} Latin American phenomenon only: Procyclicality of fiscal policy is common in many—though not all—developing countries. Why do many countries follow seemingly sub-optimal procyclical fiscal policies that add to macroeconomic instability? A common answer relies upon the supply of credit. In bad times, many developing countries cannot borrow, or can do so only at very high interest rates, therefore they cannot run deficits and have to cut spending; in booms, they can borrow more easily and choose to do so, increasing public spending (cf. Gavin and Perotti 1997; Catão and Sutton 2002; Riascos and Vegh 2003; Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh 2004). 3 In our view, however, this argument is incomplete, because it begs two critical questions. First, why don’t these countries self-insure by accumulating reserves in good times, so that they are less likely to face binding credit constraints <b>in</b> <b>recessions?</b> Second, why would lenders not provide funds to countries, even <b>in</b> <b>recessions,</b> if they were convinced that the borrowing would optimally smooth out the cycle? To answer both questions one needs to consider the political arena, as others have done and as we do in this paper. In Talvi and Vegh (2005), the presence of surpluses increases the government propensity to spend; the present article and Talvi and Vegh (2005) are complementary because they focus on how a political distortion interacts with different economic structures (in particular with the variability of revenues). In this article, we focus on deriving the political distortion. A different but not mutually exclusive political explanation is the “voracit...|$|R
