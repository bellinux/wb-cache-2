Even though everyone can enjoy the sight from a suitably dark location, it is poorly understood, and {{has been the subject}} of relatively little research. Brian May began his research into the subject in 1970, and was finally awarded his PhD in 2007, after a hiatus of more than 30 years pursuing his other career as guitarist with his rock band Queen.

40|$|We report {{preliminary}} results of optical and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on the smectic A* 2 smectic C* transition in two ferroelectric liquid crystalline polysiloxanes. Although the optical tilt angle in the SmC* phases reaches {{values up to}} 30 ‡, temperature-dependent SAXS measurements clearly reveal that the smectic layer spacing is basically conserved during the A*–C* transition {{as well as in}} the subsequent C* phase. Connected with the A*–C* transition we further observed a significant increase in bire- fringence, hence reflecting an increase of orientational order. The practical absence of layer shrinkage and the enhanced orientational ordering are consistent with the de Vries <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> model of smectic A 2 smectic C transitions...|$|R
40|$|We report {{results of}} x-ray, optic, electro-optic, and {{dielectric}} investigations on an antiferroelectric liquid- crystal mixture exhibiting a direct second-order phase transition between the Sm-A* and Sm-Ca* phases {{with virtually no}} shrinkage in the smectic layer spacing. The birefringence measurements and texture observations suggest that the phase transition follows the <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> model of Adrian de Vries, which explains the constant layer spacing. The antiferroelectric nature of the tilted phase is verified {{by the presence of}} twin polarization reversal peaks in the current response and by the absence of strong absorptions in the dielectric spectrum. The threshold for switching this phase to the synclinic, ferroelectric state is sharp and occurs at a very low voltage...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} field {{theory of the}} smectic-A−smectic-C transition has been developed for smectics with a <b>diffused</b> <b>cone</b> orientational distribution of molecules (volcano-like distribution function) in the smectic-A phase and anomalously weak layer contraction in the smectic-C phase. Orientational order parameters and smectic layer spacing have been calculated numerically as functions of temperature and compared with the results obtained using a model with a standard Maier-Saupe–type distribution function that has been considered before. A molecular theory of the electroclinic effect in chiral smectics has also been developed using the recently proposed simple biaxial interaction potential. A comparison has been made between the absolute values and temperature variations of the electroclinic coefficient obtained using the volcano model, the model with Maier-Saupe–type distribution, and the orthodox cone model proposed by de Vries. It {{has been shown that}} the model with a conventional “sugar loaf” type orientational distribution function in the smectic-A phase is sufficient to describe the main properties of smectics with anomalously weak layer contraction...|$|R
40|$|A non-layer-shrinkage {{fluorinated}} ferroelectric {{liquid crystal}} compound, 8422 @ 2 F 3 #, has been characterized by means of optical, x-ray, and calorimetric methods. The orientational distribution within macroscopic volumes determined through wide-angle x-ray scattering and birefringence measurements, {{was found to be}} identical in the Sm-A* and helical Sm-C* phases. Together with the absence of layer shrinkage, this constitutes strong evidence that the second-order Sm-A*–Sm-C* transition in this material is well described by the <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> model of de Vries. The absolute values of the layer spacing show that the molecules aggregate to antiparallel pairs. The molecular interaction across the layer boundaries will then occur only between fluorine atoms, leading to unusually weak interlayer tilt direction correlation. This explains the experimental observations of a very easily disturbed Sm-C* helix and a peculiar surface-stabilized texture. Tilt angle and birefringence values as a function of field and temperature have been evaluated in the Sm-A* and Sm-C* phases and the results corroborate the conclusions from the x-ray investigations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Visual loss, {{photophobia}} and night-blindness in {{a middle-aged}} {{patient with a}} previous history of cancer are highly suggestive of cancer-associated retinopathy. HISTORY AND SIGNS: A 63 -year-old man complained of slowly progressive bilateral visual loss, photophobia and night-blindness. His past medical history was remarkable for surgical and medical treatment of a carcinoma of {{the base of his}} tongue nine years earlier. Visual acuity was 0. 3 RE and 0. 15 LE, with constricted visual field in both eyes. Ocular examination and fluorescein angiography were non-relevant. Electroretinography revealed <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> and rod dysfunction. ICG angiography showed multiple small widespread hyperfluorescent spots. A chest CT scan revealed multiple focal lesions which were biopsied. Histological diagnosis was sarcoidosis. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Upon systemic steroid therapy, visual function gradually improved, and ICG anomalies disappeared. Vision recovered to 1. 0 RE and 0. 8 LE with normal visual field in both eyes. CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis may present as an autoimmune retinal dysfunction with photophobia and night blindness as the presenting symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{crystals}} that exhibit de Vries smectic A phases {{are promising}} materials for new generations of {{ferroelectric liquid crystal}} displays and other electro-optical devices. We investigated the molecular dynamic properties of a rod-like de Vries liquid crystal compound, namely the 9 HL, a (S) -hexyl lactate derivative, in the whole mesophasic range. This is the first molecular dynamics’ investigation on a de Vries phase, and the interest of this system {{is related to the}} understanding of the structural and supramolecular organization of de Vries SmA phases, which has been a subject of a broad scientific debate in the last years. Proton NMR spin–lattice relaxation times, T 1, were measured in the range 100 MHz to 5 kHz, thus covering a very wide range of motional regimes. 1 H NMR dispersion curves and temperature-dependent relaxation rates were analyzed with a global minimum target fitting approach and the main molecular motions, namely reorientational diffusion, translational self-diffusion, layer undulation, and tilting director fluctuations were fully characterized. The molecular dynamics’ behavior observed across the SmA–SmC* phase transitions of 9 HL was consistent with the proposed cluster <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> model for the de Vries SmA phase...|$|R
40|$|A new semi-fluorinated chiral smectic liquid crystal, W 504, is {{investigated}} by electro-optic, dielectric and X-ray scattering experiments. It exhibits a huge dielectric soft mode response, strong electroclinic effect and a birefringence which increases considerably {{with the director}} tilt angle theta; typical characteristics of a SmA - SmC transition following the de Vries asymmetric <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> (ADC) model in which the non-zero director tilt in SmC arises through an ordering of tilting directions rather than an actual increase in average molecule tilt. In W 504 a small increase in of about 4 degrees is however detected in the SmC phase. Although the increase in molecule inclination is {{much less than the}} increase in director tilt h, saturating close to 30 degrees, it leads to a shrinkage of the smectic layers by about 1 angstrom, a result of the large initial molecule tilt in the SmA phase, (SmA) approximate to 30 degrees. The tilting transition in W 504 is thus mainly an ADC model disorder - order transition, but it also has a component of a structural transition. The semi- fluorinated molecular structure of W 504 leads to a very weak electron density modulation along the layer normal, giving a vanishing form factor in bulk samples which exhibit no (001) X-ray scattering peak. In thin films the (001) peak is however observed, indicating that the electron density modulation is enhanced by the breaking of the head - tail symmetry of the liquid crystal phase at the LC - air interface...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the orthoconic antiferroelectric liquid crystal mixture W 107 by means of optical, X-ray and calorimetry measurements {{in order to assess}} the origin of the unusally high tilt angle between the optic axis and the smectic layer normal in this material. The optical birefringence increases strongly below the transition to the tilted phases, showing that the onset of tilt is coupled with a considerable increase in orientational order. The layer spacing in the smectic A (SmA) phase is notably smaller than the extended length of the molecules constituting the mixture, and the shrinkage in smectic C (SmC) and smectic C-a (SmCa) is much less than the optical tilt angle would predict. These observations indicate that the tilting transition in W 107 to a large extent follows the asymmetric de Vries <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> model. The molecules are on average considerably tilted with respect to the layer normal already in the SmA phase but the tilting directions are there randomly distributed, giving the phase its uniaxial characteristics. At the transition to the SmC phase, the distribution is biased such that the molecular tilt already present in SmA now gives a contribution to the macroscopic tilt angle. In addition, there is a certain increase of the average tilt angle, leading to a slightly smaller layer thickness in the tilted phases. Analysis of the wide angle scattering data show that the molecular tilt in SmCa is about 20 degrees larger than in SmA. The large optical tilt (45 degrees) in the SmCa phase thus results from a combination of an increased average molecule tilt and a biasing of tilt direction fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-fracture {{analysis}} of the neural connections in the outer plexiform layer of the retina of primates (Macaca mulatta and Macaca arctoides) demonstrates a remarkable diversity in the internal structure of the synaptic membranes. In the invaginating synapses of cone pedicles, the plasma membrane of the photoreceptor ending contains an aggregate of A-face particles, a hexagonal array of synaptic vesicle sites, and rows of coated vesicle sites, which are deployed in sequence from apex to base of the synaptic ridge. The horizontal cell dendrites lack vesicle sites and have two aggregates of intramembrane A-face particles, one at the interface with {{the apex of the}} synaptic ridge, the other opposite the tip of the invaginating midget bipolar dendrite. Furthermore, the horizontal cell dendrites are interconnected by a novel type of specialized junction, characterized by: (a) enlarged intercellular cleft, bisected by a dense plate and traversed by uniformly spaced crossbars; (b) symmetrical arrays of B-face particles arranged in parallel rows within the junctional membranes; and (c) a layer of dense material on the cytoplasmic surface of the membranes. The plasmalemma of the invaginating midget bipolar dendrite is unspecialized. At the contact region between the basal surface of cone pedicles and the dendrites of the flat midget and <b>diffuse</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cells, the pedicle membrane has moderately clustered A-face particles, but no vesicle sites, whereas the adjoining membrane of the bipolar dendrites contains an aggregate of B-face particles. The invaginating synapse of rod spherules differs from that of cone pedicles, because the membrane of the axonal endings of the horizontal cells only has an A-face particle aggregate opposite the apex of the synaptic ridge. Specialized junctions between horizontal cell processes, characterized by symmetrical arrays of intramembrane B-face particles, are also present in the neuropil underlying the photoreceptor endings. Small gap junctions connect the processes of the horizontal cells; other gap junctions probably connect the bipolar cell dendrites which make contact with each cone pedicle. Most of the junctional specializations typical of the primate outer plexiform layer are also found in the rabbit retina. The fact that specialized contacts between different types of neurons interacting in the outer plexiform layer have specific arrangements of intramembrane particles strongly suggests that the internal structure of the synaptic membranes is intimately correlated with synaptic function...|$|R

40|$|The retina of a diurnal insectivorous lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus (Agamidae) was {{investigated}} using microspectrophotometry {{and light and}} electron microscopy. A prominent broad yellow band was observed that extended across the mid-retina. The yellow coloration was found to originate from both oil droplets and <b>diffuse</b> pigmentation within <b>cone</b> inner segments. Microspectrophotometric analysis revealed yellow oil droplets with variable absorption of wavelengths below 520 nm and transparent oil droplets with no detectable absorptance between 350 and 750 nm. Cones with transparent oil droplets lacked the diffuse yellow pigmentation. The mean wavelengths of maximum absorbance of visual pigments in the isolated cone outer segments were at 440, 493, and 571 nm. The retina was found to possess a deep convexiclivate fovea located within the yellow band, slightly dorsotemporal of the retinal midpoint. The topography of the retinal ganglion cells revealed that the fovea was contained within an area centralis. Photoreceptors were either single (80 %) or unequal double (20 %) cones. Within {{the region of the}} fovea, the cones were approximately 20 % the diameter of those in the peripheral retina. Colored oil droplets and yellow pigment may increase visual acuity by absorbing short wavelength light scattered either by the atmosphere or the optical structures of the eye. The presence of a fovea containing slender cone photoreceptors and three visual pigments suggests that the lizard has high acuity and the potential for color vision...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We {{report a}} case of digoxin {{intoxication}} with severe visual symptoms. Patients (or Materials) and Methods: Digoxin 0. 25 mg QD for atrial fibrillation was prescribed to a 91 -year-old woman with an estimated creatinine clearance of 18 mL/min. Within 2 to 3 weeks, she developed nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia, and began complaining of snowy and blurry vision, photopsia, dyschromatopsia, aggravated bedtime visual and proprioceptive illusions (she felt as being on a boat), and colored hallucinations. She consulted her family doctor twice and visited the eye clinic once until, 1 month after starting digoxin, impaired autonomy led her {{to be admitted to}} the emergency department. Results: Digoxin intoxication was confirmed by a high plasma level measured on admission (5. 7 μg/L; reference range, 0. 8 - 2 μg/L). After stopping digoxin, general symptoms resolved in a few days, but visual symptoms persisted. Ophtalmologic care and follow-up diagnosed digoxin intoxication superimposed on pre-existing left eye (LE) cataract, dry age-related macular degeneration (DMLA), and Charles Bonnet syndrome. Visual acuity was 0. 4 (right eye, RE) and 0. 5 (LE). Ocular fundus was physiologic except for bilateral dry DMLA. Dyschromatopsia was confirmed by poor results on Ishihara test (1 / 13 OU). Computerized visual field results revealed nonspecific diffuse alterations. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) showed moderate <b>diffuse</b> rod and <b>cone</b> dysfunction. Visual symptoms progressively improved over the next 2 months, but ERG did not. Complete resolution was not expected due to the pre-existing eye disease. The patient was finally discharged home after a 5 -week hospital stay. Conclusion: Digoxin intoxication can go unrecognized by clinicians, even in a typical presentation. The range of potential visual symptoms is far greater than isolated xanthopsia (yellow vision) classically described in textbooks. Newly introduced drugs and all symptoms must be actively sought after, because they significantly affect quality of life and global functioning, especially in the elderly population, most liable not to mention them...|$|R
