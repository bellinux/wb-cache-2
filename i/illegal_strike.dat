25|$|A strike or {{lock-out}} {{is deemed}} to be illegal if it is commenced, declared or continued in contravention of the above provisions or any provision of any other written law, although a lock-out declared in consequence of an <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> or a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock-out is not illegal. It is an offence for any workman and any employer to commence, continue or otherwise act in furtherance of an <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> or lock-out; the penalty is a fine not exceeding S$2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both. It is also an offence to instigate or incite others to take part in, or otherwise act in furtherance of, an <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> or lock-out; and to give financial aid to illegal strikes or lock-outs.|$|E
25|$|Late Monday evening, Court of Queen’s Bench Justice John Rooke found AUPE in {{contempt}} of court for the <b>illegal</b> <b>strike,</b> stating the union had not done enough to convince their members to return to work. A $100,000 fine was levied against the union, with the fine increasing in substantial increments until the strike ended.|$|E

In the fall of 2007, it undertook a major campaign to press for changes in Alberta’s labour laws, which ban strikes by most AUPE members.

25|$|No person {{refusing to}} take part or to {{continue}} {{to take part}} in any <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> or lock-out is subject to expulsion from any trade union or society, or to any fine or penalty, or to the deprivation of any right or benefit to which he or his legal personal representatives would otherwise be entitled.

25|$|The BCTF {{began an}} <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> on October 7, 2005. It {{maintained}} that {{breaking the law}} for a just cause (having its collective bargaining rights limited and a contract imposed) was acceptable. Critics of the BCTF claimed that the illegal job action set a bad example for the children they teach. The job action was illegal because teaching in British Columbia was considered an essential service and teachers {{were not allowed to}} strike. The BCTF, however, maintained that under the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the non-binding decisions of the United Nations International Labour Organization, education is not an essential service and it had the right to political protest.|$|E
25|$|TTC General Manager Rick Ducharme {{announced}} his resignation on June 7, 2006, following a one-day wildcat strike by transit workers. He blamed political interference for his decision, saying that Moscoe had conducted direct {{negotiations with the}} union without consulting him. The Toronto Star speculated that the <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> might have resulted from Moscoe's negotiations, while David Shiner and other councilors said that Moscoe {{had a history of}} interfering in management affairs. John Barber, a columnist for the rival Globe and Mail, argued that Ducharme's resignation was not a reasonable response to Moscoe's alleged interference. Moscoe defended his actions, arguing that he had an obligation {{to take part in the}} discussions and was attempting to ensure that a second strike did not take place. He later said that management was to blame for the wildcat strike, and that he intervened in an attempt to stop it.|$|E
40|$|From {{the return}} to {{democracy}} to the present, <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> have acquired a prominent role in Chile’s labor conflicts, mainly {{due to the fact}} that many more workers mobilize, compared to those who participate in legal strikes. Nevertheless, existing studies on the subject focus on descriptions and general tendencies, thus neglecting the in-depth analysis of the factors determining the specific occurrence of the extralegal strikes. Consequently, the factors that might be contributing to the possibility of <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> remain unknown. If labor strikes are construed as analytical events that are fundamental in order to understand power relations in capitalist enterprises, the review of the international literature on the subject helps us solve that problem, since it proposes statistical analysis models to study the economy at the national level (economic cycles), trade union organization (membership and size of unions), and work regime (fragmentation and job insecurity), as well as a further company-level analysis of the last two models. On the basis of statistics regarding the strikes that took place in Chile between 1990 and 2015 and a binary logistic regression analysis, we analyzed the weight of each one of those statistical models separately and that of all of them taken together, in the private sector of the economy (in which it is possible to opt for one or the other strike modality in the Chilean case. The results show that the trade union organization and the work regime models have a greater power to determine <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes,</b> and that the economic model loses meaning when its variables are included in the complete model. Finally, the article presents the conclusions regarding the relevance of the distinction between legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> for the Chilean case, in terms of workers that not only represent subjects without rights, but also actors with a certain autonomy regarding legality. In this sense, these mobilizations lead to the study of the organizational power certain workers have shown in the face of adverse external conditions (both in the law and in the new forms of work), in the context of the tactica debate over how to revitalize Chilean unionism...|$|R
25|$|A {{protracted}} fight erupted {{between those}} in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. A series of <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> occurred between September 9 and November 17, 1968. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being 'Jewish-dominated'.|$|R
50|$|After the {{war against}} Soviet Union ended in September 1944, labour disputed bursted out as number of legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes.</b> This created {{challenges}} to the war reparations industry which had to follow the strict schedule set in the armistice. Moreover, the strikes often included volatile demonstrations, which were feared to escalate riots leading communists rising to power.|$|R
25|$|Other strikes {{could not}} be avoided. Usery {{was part of a}} DOL team which was unable to avoid a {{national}} postal service strike. The <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> by more than 210,000 United States Postal Service workers began on March 18, 1970, in New York City. Nixon appeared on national television and ordered the employees back to work, but his address only stiffened the resolve of the existing strikers and angered workers in other 671 locations in other cities into walking out as well. Workers in other government agencies also announced they would strike as well if Nixon pursued legal action against the postal employees. The strike crippled the nation's mail system, disrupting delivery of pension and welfare checks, tax refunds, census forms, and draft notices. Businesses hired planes and trucks to deliver publications or letters. Nixon spoke to the nation again on March 25 and ordered a 24,000 Army, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Air National Guard, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve forces to begin distributing the mail. But the military proved ineffective at distributing the mail.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 November 2012, 102 drivers from China {{employed}} by SMRT Buses refused {{to report to}} work, citing dissatisfaction with being paid less than their Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts and unhappiness with their living conditions. The following day, about 60 drivers again refused to work. The drivers returned to work on 28 November. Subsequently, five drivers alleged to have instigated their colleagues {{to participate in the}} <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> were charged under the CLTPA. On 3 December, one of the drivers pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment. The other four drivers claimed trial, but eventually pleaded guilty on 25 February 2013. Senior District Judge See Kee Oon imposed deterrent sentences on them [...] "to ensure that others are not emboldened towards attempting similar displays of disaffection over employment terms or conditions". He held that one aggravating factor was that the four drivers had planned the strike [...] "ostensibly with the purpose of putting pressure on SMRT to accommodate their demands, but with the clear consciousness that it would cause disruption and inconvenience in the provision of transport services. This had the potential to severely affect the daily lives of all commuters who rely on public transport." [...] One driver who admitted to two charges of conspiring and inciting other drivers to participate in the strike was sentenced to seven weeks' jail, while the other three were each sentenced to six weeks' jail on one charge of conspiring to instigate the other drivers. Twenty-nine other [...] "active participants" [...] in the strike were repatriated to China in December 2012.|$|E

Shamrock had already been given one warning earlier in the match for <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> to the back of Gracie's head. After the match, Gracie had to be helped out of the ring and back to his dressing room by his team allegedly due to receiving a concussion from the strikes.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of several years of major annual deficits, DSB started {{implementing}} one-man operation on several rail lines on 29 June 2013. This led to reductions in staff, followed by widespread protest and some small <b>illegal</b> <b>strikes</b> by train drivers, who accused DSB of using rolling stock which was unsafe for one-man operation. The Danish Railway Union stated in 2011 [...] "that one-man operation wasn't their cup of tea".|$|R

50|$|Lauzon was a {{contestant}} on The Ultimate Fighter 5, {{which featured}} lightweights exclusively. He was on B.J. Penn's team, against a team coached by Jens Pulver. Lauzon defeated Brian Geraghty in the preliminary round. He then defeated Cole Miller in the quarterfinals. The win was somewhat controversial {{due to an}} <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> {{to the back of}} Miller's head. Miller appeared obviously dazed by the <b>illegal</b> <b>strike</b> and was given time to recover. However, when action was restarted, it was clear that Cole was still feeling the effects of the strike. Lauzon capitalized on it and won the fight. In the semi-finals, Lauzon lost a unanimous decision to Manvel Gamburyan. In the finale, he defeated Brandon Melendez via submission (triangle choke) at 2:09 of round two.|$|E
