500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E
60|$|His Excellency looked blank. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> breath, {{wondering}} what coup Madame was meditating.|$|E
60|$|So we {{rose and}} went home. But <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace, for I was afraid, very much afraid.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>'eld</b> <b>my</b> breath. Five sailormen {{out of ten}} {{have been}} tattooed with mermaids, and I was one of 'em. When she spoke agin I thought I should ha' dropped.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> back <b>my</b> love's {{name and}} kept repeating it to myself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hands. The grey {{creature}} {{in the corner}} leant forward.|$|R
60|$|The {{manager was}} a grave, calm man. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> fifty-six dollars {{clutched}} in a crumpled ball in my pocket.|$|E
60|$|PRIEST I cannot sleep out the night. Perhaps if <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> service {{during the}} night under this pine tree....|$|E
60|$|I couldn't {{think what}} this meant; but as auntie wished it, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace, all {{inwardly}} trembling with suppressed excitement.|$|E

60|$|I didn't {{hesitate}} a moment. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> up <b>my</b> bean, and we clicked beans all around.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand mechanically, and {{he pressed}} it, {{and went with}} me to the door.|$|R
60|$|The {{recollection}} {{seemed to}} have amused her so much that for the moment <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> breath and ignored her question.|$|E
60|$|I looked {{round and}} could see no one, so, {{thinking}} that I had been deceived by my imagination, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace.|$|E
60|$|Her {{beginning}} was so bold that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> breath, {{knowing full well}} as I did that she had chosen the very note.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand to {{the tall}} man, who look it in a hesitating, half-reluctant fashion.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked so}} sad, and yet withal so comical, that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand to him, laughing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand to {{help her}} to the ground, but she paused on the second step.|$|R
60|$|I was staggered. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace, {{and the two}} stood {{watching}} me. Then I heard footsteps approaching us, and a familiar voice.|$|E
60|$|My head swam round. It was {{all like}} a dream to me. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> {{forehead}} with my hands, and gazed blankly at the Inspector.|$|E
60|$|However, {{all seemed}} to {{understand}} that, if the sergeant's plan was to be carried out, he should arrange the details, and therefore <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a deep}} silence. Then <b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand to {{my father}} and he clasped it.|$|R
60|$|I {{started a}} little, but <b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace. He looked hard into {{the ashes of}} the fire, and continued.|$|R
60|$|He {{started at}} the sound of my voice, and took a quick step towards me. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} wise had <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace and gone; but, like a fool, I must needs give {{utterance}} {{to what was}} in my mind.|$|E
60|$|He had to repeat, {{and still}} <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> tongue. Even as I hesitated {{there came a}} knock at the door, and Scipio entered, bearing candles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, we shall," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{learned this}} {{and lots of}} other things when <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> head in that smoke last night." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Tlön, or How <b>I</b> <b>held</b> in <b>my</b> hands a vast methodical {{fragment}} {{of an unknown}} planet’s entire history (2003) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> up <b>my</b> hand, not {{wishing to}} hear details. Mavovo rose, and with a little smile, went about his business.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{all things}} in the forests and the birds in the sky and--and moles, and this?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>held</b> down <b>my</b> limp, coral-coloured arithmetic.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> {{breath for}} my grandfather's reply. The rector, however, had read him, and well {{knew that a}} show of {{reluctance}} would but inflame him the more.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> {{ears and}} {{crouched}} low, {{sitting up in}} my bed in the dark. But the dream seemed to go on still: it remained with me distinctly.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{lay back}} as if bent on going to sleep, and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace, {{determined}} to say no more even though he remained there until sunrise.|$|E
60|$|Great was my boyish delight at the {{prospect}} of visiting a place, the infallible clew to all whose intricacies <b>I</b> <b>held</b> in <b>my</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|Three {{dishes were}} taken up, dried, {{and put down}} before she {{answered}} me. I threw pebbles into the brook, and wished <b>I</b> had <b>held</b> <b>my</b> tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have cut}} myself,' I said, 'and rather badly. See!' And <b>I</b> <b>held</b> out <b>my</b> two hands {{from which the}} blood was oozing and dripping.|$|R
