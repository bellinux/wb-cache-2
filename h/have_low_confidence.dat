50|$|Another {{difference}} in mathematic abilities often explored in research concerns gender disparities. There has been research examining gender {{difference in}} performance {{on standardized tests}} across various countries. Beller and Gafni's have shown that children at approximately nine years of age do not show consistent gender difference in relation to math skills. However, in 17 out of the 20 countries examined in this study, 13-year-old boys tended to score higher than girls. Moreover, mathematics is often labeled as a masculine ability; as a result, girls often <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>confidence</b> in their math capabilities. These gender stereotypes can reinforce low confidence in girls and can cause math anxiety as {{research has shown that}} performance on standardized math tests is affected by one's confidence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2006). As a result, educators have been trying to abolish this stereotype by fostering confidence in math in all students in order to avoid math anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Sexuality plays a {{large role}} in the {{prediction}} of mental illnesses and overall mental health. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer have a higher risk of having mental health issues, most likely {{as a result of the}} continued discrimination and victimization they receive at the hands of others. Members of this population are confronted with derogatory and hateful comments, whether through face-to-face communication or through social media, which affects their self-worth and confidence, leading to anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide. These mental health effects are most commonly seen among adolescents, however, they are also prevalent among adults of all ages. The sources of discrimination and victimization that the LGBTQ population suffers from can be both external and internal. While parts of society today are not accepting of the LGBTQ community and make public statements to advertise their discontent, an identifying LGBTQ can also <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>confidence</b> and a lack of self-worth that furthers these negative mental health effects.|$|E

Gains made in confidence through the January workshop had been maintained to the end of Term 1. The most common professional learning activities conducted in Term 1 were sharing resources and experiences, answering questions about the program and gaining the support of the principal. Classroom teachers more frequently taught PC, observed colleagues teaching PC, invited a colleague to observe them teaching PC and advocated with the principal than other PLFs. The other PLFs more frequently visited schools to see how PC was being implemented, presented information sessions for a group of principals or to district or sector policy makers, leaders or consultants. The PLFs presented 28 workshops in Term 1 and they planned to present 46 more workshops during the year. Most workshops were the Introduction to Primary Connections workshop. Most PLFs modified the professional learning resources to suit the local context. Suggestions for modifying the professional learning resources included breaking the one-day Introduction to Primary Connections workshop into smaller modules and adding more work samples. Key factors influencing PLFs’ effectiveness in their roles include support from their line manager, having access to quality resources, schools’ interest in the program, time to present workshops and availability of time in schools for staff to attend workshops, and access to curriculum units for workshops...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The k-nearest {{neighbor}} rule {{is one of}} {{the most}} attractive pattern classification algorithms. In practice, the value of k is usually determined by the cross-validation method. In this work, we propose a new method that locally determines the number of nearest neighbors based on the concept of statistical confidence. We define the confidence associated with decisions that are made by the majority rule from a finite number of observations and use it as a criterion to determine the number of nearest neighbors needed. The new algorithm is tested on several realworld datasets and yields results comparable to those obtained by the knearest neighbor rule. In contrast to the k-nearest neighbor rule that uses a fixed number of nearest neighbors throughout the feature space, our method locally adjusts the number of neighbors until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached. In addition, the statistical confidence provides a natural way to balance the trade-off between the reject rate and the error rate by excluding patterns that <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>confidence</b> levels. ...|$|E

As a result, service users have to depend on off-line techniques to build confidence in their information practices. One implication of not having effective support for confidence building designed into the on-line service is that, despite costly investment in trust marks, security technologies and brand development, service users will continue to give false information, limit the extent of their engagement in on-line services and avoid registration with on-line services. In the era of on-line public services delivery, this pattern of privacy protection practice potentially has devastating consequences for public service delivery and the ability of the most vulnerable to receive the public service support that they need. The study also indicates that providing interaction possibilities through social computing as part of the service design is one way to help build service user confidence.
