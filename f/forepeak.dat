5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the <b>forepeak</b> tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
25|$|Before her launch on 23 May 1912, Cunard {{announced}} that their new ship, , which was under construction {{at the time}} at the John Brown shipyards in Glasgow, would be longer by one foot. There was chagrin in Hamburg. Several weeks later, she was fitted with an imposing bronze eagle figurehead, created by Professor Bruno Kruse of Berlin, which adorned her <b>forepeak</b> with a banner emblazoned with HAPAG's motto Mein Feld ist die Welt (My field is the world); this extension increased Imperator length sufficiently to (easily) surpass Aquitania. The eagle's wings were later torn off in an Atlantic storm during the 1914 season, after which it was removed and replaced with gold scroll-work which was similar to what was on her stern.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{and expanding}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round. In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either mid-life update or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old Voima was extensively rebuilt by Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard in 1978–1979 {{at a cost}} of about FIM 86 million, 60% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, Voima received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, Voima was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, <b>forepeak</b> and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time. She returned to service on 10 October 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Ravelston {{was built}} for the Ravelston Steamship Co Ltd. Her port of {{registry}} was Grangemouth. On 28 January 1929, Ravelston was in collision with [...] in thick fog off Dungeness, Kent. Both ships were severely damaged at the bow, with their <b>forepeaks</b> flooded. Ravelston was requisitioned in 1941 by the MoWT. She was renamed Empire Bond and was operated under the management of Gillespie and Nichol. Empire Bond {{was a member of}} a number of convoys during the Second World War.|$|R
5000|$|Monte Piana {{was built}} by Cantiere Navale Triestino, Monfalcone for Navigazione Generale Gerolimich & Compagnia Società in Anzioni, Trieste. She was {{completed}} in July 1926 and named after the Northern Italian mountain of the same name. On 18 June 1933, Monte Piana was in collision with the Greek ship [...] in the River Plate, in Argentine waters. Both ships sustained damage to their bows, with their <b>forepeaks</b> flooded. On 18 May 1937, Monte Piana departed Calcutta, India for Genoa, Italy. A fire broke out {{in one of her}} holds. It was brought under control and Monte Piana returned to port.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the biggest}} {{boat on the}} lakes, the Bradley was {{traditionally}} the first boat through the Straits of Mackinac when the ice kept the smaller vessels from leaving port. [...] She served as an icebreaker. [...] Her <b>forepeak</b> was filled with cement; she would break ice to Indiana, {{and then go to}} the Lorain shipyard for replacement of broken plates before starting her season.|$|E
2500|$|With her liner route linking Southampton and South America, Andes {{was built}} to cover long {{distances}} without resupply. Her fuel capacity was specified to be [...] "not less than 4,950 tons", and she had bunker oil tanks in her double bottom, aft peak, and between her machinery space and No. 3 hold. Her original fresh water capacity was nearly 2,500 tons, with tanks in her double bottom, <b>forepeak,</b> No. 1 hold, and between and beside her propeller shaft tunnels.|$|E
2500|$|At {{first the}} Île de France {{was used to}} ferry American and Canadian troops home. Then in April 1947, the ship {{returned}} to its builder's yard at Saint Nazaire for a two-year restoration. The outcome included the removal of its third [...] "dummy" [...] funnel and an upturn of the straight black hull to meet its upper <b>forepeak,</b> {{in keeping with the}} new style of the CGT's ships beginning with the Normandie in 1935. These changes increased Ile de Frances gross tonnage to 44,356.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Coast Guard {{described}} the Bradleys {{design and construction}} as: ... typical arrangement for self-unloading type vessels with a <b>forepeak</b> and large cargo area, and hawing propulsion machinery aft. [...] These areas were separated by two transverse watertight bulkheads, the collision bulkhead at frame 12, and the engine room forward bulkhead at frame 173. [...] The cargo hold space was divided into five compartments by screen bulkheads above the tunnel and the unloading machinery was located in the conveyor room just forward the cargo spaces. [...] The entire 475 foot length of the cargo space was open longitudinally through the tunnel and conveyor room.|$|E
2500|$|Wellington was in bad condition, {{having been}} torpedoed in the <b>forepeak.</b> Her master {{believed}} she would stay afloat, but all but eleven {{of his men}} refused to remain on board. [...] Seneca First Lieutenant F. W. Brown at once volunteered to assist Wellingtons master, and almost the entire crew of Seneca wanted to go with him. Nineteen of these Seneca volunteers were selected to go with Lieutenant Brown to the Wellington, while eleven of the 42 men in Wellingtons crew also remained with the master. Lieutenant Brown was {{to be in charge}} of the ship, but the master was to navigate her into the nearest port which was Brest, France.|$|E

[...] To assist icebreaking in difficult conditions she is also equipped with heeling tanks and pumps capable of transferring 570 tons of water from one side to another in ten minutes, listing the ship by 10 degrees. Furthermore, her trim could be adjusted by a <b>forepeak</b> tank with a capacity of 600 tons of water. All tanks were connected to an electrical control and indication system.|$|E
2500|$|Captain John McArthur Jr., of Michigan, {{ordered the}} thick towing hawser pulled in within hailing {{distance}} of Drake to communicate their status by shouts amplified with a megaphone. It {{was decided that}} Michigans crew would be removed in the pitch black night as {{there was no chance}} of launching Michigans yawl in the prevailing winds. Michigan was drawn up to Drake so that her bow was up against Drakes stern quarter on the leeward side. With the two wooden hulls grinding against each other, the crew of Michigan leaped to Drake when the waves brought the two decks level to one another. Just as the last of the Michigans crew were safely transferred to Drake, the wind carried Michigan into a sea trough causing her jib boom that jutted forward from her <b>forepeak</b> to rake across length of Drake. [...] Drakes after cabin was fractured and her tall smoke stack was lopped off and shoved overboard.|$|E
2500|$|At 08:12 on 21 November 1916, a loud {{explosion}} {{shook the}} ship. The cause, {{whether it was}} a torpedo from an enemy submarine or a mine, was not apparent. It would later be revealed that the mines were planted in the Kea Channel on 21 October 1916 by [...] under the command of [...] The reaction in the dining room was immediate; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way, as further aft, the power of the explosion was less felt and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat. Captain Bartlett and Chief Officer Hume were on the bridge at the time and the gravity of the situation was soon evident. The explosion was on the starboard side, between holds two and three. The force of the explosion damaged the watertight bulkhead between hold one and the <b>forepeak.</b> The first four watertight compartments were filling rapidly with water, the boiler-man's tunnel connecting the firemen's quarters in the bow with boiler room six was seriously damaged, and water was flowing into that boiler room.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I did not,' said Jim. 'I {{was told}} to call no one and to make no noise for fear of {{creating}} a panic. I thought the precaution reasonable. I {{took one of the}} lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward. After opening the <b>forepeak</b> hatch I heard splashing in there. I lowered then the lamp the whole drift of its lanyard, and saw that the <b>forepeak</b> was more than half full of water already. I knew then there must be a big hole below the water-line.' He paused.|$|E
6000|$|... "One Saturday evening, I being off duty, the men {{asked me}} {{to give them an}} extra bucket of water or so--for washing clothes. As I did not wish to screw on the fresh-water pump so late, I went forward whistling, and with a key in my hand to unlock the <b>forepeak</b> scuttle, {{intending}} to serve the water out of a spare tank we kept there.|$|E
60|$|The arm was set and splinted; {{the body}} of Brown fetched from the <b>forepeak,</b> where it lay stiff and cold, and {{committed}} to {{the waters of the}} lagoon; and the washing of the cabin rudely finished. All these were done ere mid-day; and it was past three when the first cat's-paw ruffled the lagoon, and the wind came in a dry squall, which presently sobered to a steady breeze.|$|E
6000|$|This {{had been}} bad enough, but worse {{remained}} behind. There was still Brown in the <b>forepeak.</b> Tommy, {{with a sudden}} clamour of weeping, begged for his life. [...] "One man can't hurt us," [...] he sobbed. [...] "We can't go on with this. I spoke to him at dinner. He's an awful decent little cad. It can't be done. Nobody can go into that place and murder him. It's too damned wicked." ...|$|E
60|$|The machine {{had evidently}} dropped {{vertically}} and was badly knocked about amidst {{a lot of}} smashed branches in a clump of trees. Its bent and broken wings and shattered stays sprawled amidst new splintered wood, and its <b>forepeak</b> stuck into the ground. The aeronaut dangled weirdly head downward among the leaves and branches some yards away, and Bert only discovered him as he turned from the aeroplane. In the dusky evening light and stillness--for the sun had gone now and the wind had altogether fallen-this inverted yellow face was anything but a tranquilising object to discover suddenly a couple of yards away. A broken branch had run clean through the man's thorax, and he hung, so stabbed, looking limp and absurd. In his hand he still clutched, with the grip of death, a short light rifle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Moses Murphy!" [...] {{cried the}} captain. [...] "How did she strike? Bows on, I believe. And she's {{down by the}} head now. If any {{carpenter}} comes tinkering here where'll he go first? Down in the <b>forepeak,</b> I suppose! And then, how about all that blood among the chandlery? You would think you were a lot of members of Parliament discussing Plimsoll; and you're just a pack of murderers with the halter round your neck. Any other ass got any time to waste? No? Thank God for that! Now, all hands! I'm going below, and I leave you here on deck. You get the boat-cover off that boat; then you turn to and open the specie chest. There are five of us; get five chests, and divide the specie equal among the five--put it at the bottom--and go at it like tigers. Get blankets, or canvas, or clothes, so it won't rattle. It'll make five pretty heavy chests, but we can't help that. You, Carthew--dash me!--You, Mr. Goddedaal, come below. We've our share before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not think}} of danger just then. I might have been a little startled: all this {{happened}} in such a quiet way and so very suddenly. I knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the <b>forepeak</b> from the forehold. I went back to tell the captain. I came upon the second engineer getting up {{at the foot of the}} bridge-ladder: he seemed dazed, and told me he thought his left arm was broken; he had slipped on the top step when getting down while I was forward. He exclaimed, [...] "My God! That rotten bulkhead'll give way in a minute, and the damned thing will go down under us like a lump of lead." [...] He pushed me away with his right arm and ran before me up the ladder, shouting as he climbed. His left arm hung by his side. I followed up in time to see the captain rush at him and knock him down flat on his back. He did not strike him again: he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low. I fancy he was asking him why the devil he didn't go and stop the engines, instead of making a row about it on deck. I heard him say, [...] "Get up! Run! fly!" [...] He swore also. The engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine-room companion which was on the port side. He moaned as he ran. [...] .' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{forecastle}} was a {{place of}} damp desolation. They looked at their dwelling with dismay. It was slimy, dripping; it hummed hollow with the wind, and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a half-tide cavern in a rocky and exposed coast. Many had lost all they had in the world, but most of the starboard watch had preserved their chests; thin streams of water trickled out of them, however. The beds were soaked; the blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot. They dragged wet rags from evil-smelling corners, and wringing the water out, recognised their property. Some smiled stiffly. Others looked round blank and mute. There were cries of joy over old waistcoats, and groans of sorrow over shapeless things found among the splinters of smashed bed boards. One lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit. Charley whimpered a little. Knowles stumped here and there, sniffing, examining dark places for salvage. He poured dirty water out of a boot, and was concerned to find the owner. Those who, overwhelmed by their losses, sat on the <b>forepeak</b> hatch, remained elbows on knees, and, with a fist against each cheek, disdained to look up. He pushed it under their noses. [...] "Here's a good boot. Yours?" [...] They snarled, [...] "No--get out." [...] One snapped at him, [...] "Take it to hell out of this." [...] He seemed surprised. [...] "Why? It's a good boot," [...] but remembering suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing, he dropped his find and began to swear. In the dim light cursing voices clashed. A man came in and, dropping his arms, stood still, repeating from the doorstep, [...] "Here's a bloomin' old go! Here's a bloomin' old go!" [...] A few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco. They breathed hard, clamoured with heads down. [...] "Look at that Jack!"... "Here! Sam! Here's my shore-going rig spoilt for ever." [...] One blasphemed tearfully, holding up a pair of dripping trousers. No one looked at him. The cat came out from somewhere. He had an ovation. They snatched him from hand to hand, caressed him in a murmur of pet names. They wondered where he had [...] "weathered it out;" [...] disputed about it. A squabbling argument began. Two men brought in a bucket of fresh water, and all crowded round it; but Tom, lean and mewing, came up with every hair astir and had the first drink. A couple of hands went aft for oil and biscuits.|$|E

5000|$|V-berth: Almost all yachts have {{a bed in}} {{the extreme}} forward end of the hull (usually in a {{separate}} cabin called the <b>forepeak).</b> Because of {{the shape of the}} hull this bed is basically triangular, though most also have a triangular notch cut out of the middle of the aft end, splitting it partially into two separate beds and making it more of a V shape, hence the name. This notch can usually be filled in with a detachable board and cushion, creating something more like a double bed (though with drastically reduced space for the feet; 12" [...] wide is typical).

50|$|The Moore 24 is {{constructed}} of vacuum-bagged fiberglass and balsa composite hull and deck structure with a Bruynzeel plywood interior. Of particular {{interest is the}} main bulkhead, which has a circular passage allowing access to the <b>forepeak.</b> The original hulls were partially cored in the bow and aft central portion of the hull. Later models had a complete balsa-cored hull. There are two quarterberths aft, and the <b>forepeak</b> can be outfitted with cushions to create a small double berth. The keel {{is constructed}} out of 1,050 lbs (477 kg) of lead, covered in resin and gelcoat, producing an appendage that flows seamlessly from the hull. While bolted in place, the keel is not easily removed. The rudder is a fiberglass and foam sandwich with an aluminum rudder shaft.
