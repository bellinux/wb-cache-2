5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

500|$|Lao: Depending on the intonation, {{the word}} is Chinese for [...] "firm, solid" [...] or [...] "old". It is also an allusion to either or both the philosopher Lao-Tzu, author of the Tao Te Ching, or the Lao {{people who live in}} Southeast Asia. The {{character}} Lao quotes Chinese philosophers and is a friend of Pitar. When he leaves the band after the attack of the sabre-tooth, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the direction of East Africa and Asia.|$|E
60|$|As the high-priest {{went into}} the holiest when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> thither alone; so to do that work, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> thither but once a year. Thou shalt not come 'at all times,' said God to him, 'into the holy place, within the veil, before the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark, that thou die not' (Lev 16:2).|$|R

500|$|Rosas {{failed to}} realize that discontent was {{steadily}} growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at {{his right hand and}} became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: [...] "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> constant fear and always has one eye on the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night".|$|E
500|$|Many of the 82 Fredman's Epistles remain {{popular in}} Sweden. Their diverse styles and themes may be {{illustrated}} {{with examples of}} some of the best-known songs. To begin with No. 23, Ach du min Moder! (Alas, thou my mother), which has been described as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature", tells, in realist style, the story of a drunk who wakes in a Stockholm gutter outside the Crawl-In Tavern. He curses his parents for conceiving him [...] "perhaps upon a table" [...] as he looks at his torn clothes. Then the tavern door opens, and <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> and has his first drink. The song ends with loud thanks to the drunk's mother and father. In contrast, the Rococo No. 28, I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja (Yesterday I saw thy child, my Freya), tells the tale of an attempt to arrest the [...] "nymph" [...] Ulla Winblad, based on a real event. Bellman here combines realism – Ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice, and losing her watch in a named street (Yxsmedsgränd) in Stockholm's Gamla stan – with images from classical mythology, such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{goes with}} Berenbaum to see Eckerle at his {{facility}}. She {{stays in the}} car while <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the facility to find Eckerle {{who is in a}} hysterical, paranoid state, having been unable to escape the roaches that he feels are following him. Eckerle pulls a gun on Mulder, thinking that even he may somehow be a cockroach. Scully arrives on the scene and meets Berenbaum. [...] Scully then goes in the facility seeking for Mulder and then phones Mulder, and when Mulder's phone rings, Eckerle believes it to be Mulder making a tone {{like the rest of the}} unusual roaches. Eckerle fires at Mulder, and his shots rupture and ignite pipes containing methane gas. The agents flee, and the facility explodes with Eckerle still inside. The next day, Dr. Ivanov arrives to talk with Mulder at the scene of the explosion and meets Berenbaum. The two leave with one another, discussing their interests in insects and robots. That night Mulder writes his report on the case, wondering how humanity would react if insect-like robots visited Earth. Mulder finds a bizarre looking bug by his food, and crushes it with an X-File.|$|E

60|$|He then {{followed}} his conductor {{to a large}} house in the principal street, where <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> {{to a sort of}} office and spoke to a man sitting there. Then <b>he</b> <b>went</b> out, and <b>in</b> a minute returned with a gentleman.|$|R

2500|$|Filch has a cat named Mrs Norris {{to whom he}} has a {{particular}} and possessive attachment. She acts as a hallway monitor or spy for Filch. If she observes students engaging in suspicious activity or out of bed after curfew, she finds Filch and he arrives in seconds. She {{has been known to}} follow Hagrid everywhere <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the school, apparently under Filch's orders. According to J.K. Rowling, there is nothing particularly magical about Mrs Norris, other than her being [...] "just an intelligent (and unpleasant) cat." [...] It's the ambition of many Hogwarts students to [...] "give her a good kick". In the Chamber of Secrets incident, Mrs Norris is temporarily petrified by the Basilisk, which causes Filch extreme distress.|$|E

2500|$|An {{allegedly}} fraudulent Twitter account posing to be Canibus began posting inflammatory comments towards Royce da 5'9" [...] and the Shady Records camp {{in early}} 2011, inciting verbal rebuttals from Royce, {{believing that the}} account had been him. Royce's fulmination continued, even after it had been announced that the account was fake by Canibus himself. This caused Canibus to release snippets from a track {{in which he has}} lines directed toward Royce. Royce responded simply by saying that Canibus had [...] "fallen off" [...] and could no longer rap well. Similar comments regarding the track were made by affiliate Joe Budden. Insulted, Canibus decided to release two audio snippets. One titled [...] "Lyrical Law VS Joey Cupcakes" [...] in which he harshly insults Budden; poking fun at his personal life and taking smaller shots at Royce da 5'9". the other, titled [...] "Lyrical Law VS Royce da 5'9"" [...] was a length of audio in which <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> depth about his perception of the situation and further insults Royce da 5'9".|$|E
2500|$|As <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in,</b> {{there is}} already another surfer riding the wave, leaving Utah unstable. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints, but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the surfer, Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez), and his team Roach (Clemens Schick), Chowder (Tobias Santelmann), and Grommet (Matias Varela). They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl, Samsara (Teresa Palmer). The next day, Utah finds the men in an {{abandoned}} Paris train station after he overhears them talking about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he is accepted into the circle. They travel to the Alps for the next ordeal, wingsuit flying through the cliffs [...] "The Life of Wind". The four succeed in their attempt and spend some time together with Samsara. The next day, they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding down a steep mountain of snow. They reach their spot, but Utah decides to extend his line, so the others follow him. Chowder slips and falls to his death, and Utah becomes depressed about it.|$|E
2500|$|It was in Boston that Mike became [...] "King" [...] Kelly, {{although}} he was still overwhelmingly referred to as [...] "Mike" [...] or [...] "The Only" [...] in contemporaneous reporting. As {{a member of the}} Beaneaters, he continued to be a key run-producer, scoring 120 runs in 1887 and 1889. He continued to play well and was a great box office draw, but Boston didn't win any pennants. Freed from the watchful eye of Spalding and Anson, Kelly became less self-disciplined. [...] One day in 1888, Boston player-manager John Morrill fined him $100 for not reporting to the grounds one day. After dinner the night before, Kelly had told Morrill he was ill, and Morrill said he should still report. The Boston Herald said, [...] "Every man on the team thinks [...] was deserved." [...] The Herald also said of Kelly, [...] "At times <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> and plays with his whole spirit, and he puts life into the team. [...] A sample of that was seen in yesterday's game, a game that he won for the Bostons. At other times he plays carelessly and indifferently, puts on a spirit of independence, disobeys Morrill on instructions at will, and does as he pleases." ...|$|E

2500|$|The second {{narrative}} {{episode of}} the poem is a psychomachian battle between the hosts of Virtue and Vice for the field of Microcosm, which is possessed by Freewill. [...] As the battle heats up, Freewill joins forces with Vice and they begin to drive Virtue and his host from the field. [...] Perseverance comes and rallies Virtue’s troops, defeats Vice and wins the field. [...] Freewill goes {{through a process of}} cleansing and is made a vassal of Virtue. [...] Reason and Sadness are given control of Microcosm and set about cleansing it of the weeds planted there by Sensuality. [...] A disgusted Atropos determines to leave the service of the “counterfete” gods saying, “For oo God ther ys that can euery dell / Turne as hym lyst, bothe dry & whete, / In to whos seruyce I shall assay to gete” (39). [...] <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> search of the Lord of Light and is told by Righteousness that the Lord of Light has been his master all along. [...] Atropos’ name is changed to Death and he is sent to Microcosm. [...] Priesthood and the sacraments are sent to the field to prepare it for the coming of Death who causes the grass to wither and shuts the gates on the field.|$|E
2500|$|In the ditch, the {{political}} hacks are ordered {{to strip off}} their clothes and engage in a diving contest. Dulness says, [...] "Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around/ The stream, be his the Weekly Journals, bound" [...] (II 267–8), while a load of lead {{will go to the}} deepest diver and a load of coal to the others who participate. [...] "The Weekly Journals" [...] was a collective noun, referring to London Journal, Mist's Journal, British Journal, Daily Journal, inter al. [...] In this contest, John Dennis climbs up as high as a post and dives in, disappearing forever. Next, [...] "Smedly" [...] (Jonathan Smedley, a religious opportunist who criticised Jonathan Swift for gain) dives in and vanishes. Others attempt the task, but none succeed like Leonard Welsted (who had satirised Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot's play Three Hours after Marriage in 1717), for <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> swinging his arms like a windmill (to splash all with mud): [...] "No crab more active in the dirty dance,/ Downward to climb, and backward to advance" [...] (II 296–7). He wins the Journals, but Smedly reappears, saying that he had gone {{all the way down to}} Hades, where he had seen that a branch of Styx flows into the Thames, so that all who drink city water grow dull and forgetful from Lethe.|$|E
2500|$|During [...] "After Hours", Jim enlists Dwight into {{trying to}} get Kathy, an {{unwanted}} female suitor, {{out of his room}} by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In [...] "Last Day in Florida", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including {{in front of the other}} Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in,</b> and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.|$|E
