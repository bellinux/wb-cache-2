Prior art fuel injector elements were normally tested by use of low pressure apparatuses which did not provide a purge to prevent mist from obscuring the injector element or to prevent frosting of the view windows; could utilize only one fluid during each test; and had their viewing ports positioned one hundred eighty (180 deg) apart, thus preventing optimum use of laser diagnostics. The high pressure fluid injector test apparatus includes an upper hub, an upper weldment or <b>housing,</b> a first <b>clamp</b> and stud/nut assembly for securing the upper hub to the upper weldment, a standoff assembly within the upper weldment, a pair of window housings having view glasses within the upper weldment, an injector block assembly and purge plate within the upper weldment for holding an injector element to be tested and evaluated, a lower weldment or <b>housing,</b> a second <b>clamp</b> and stud/nut assembly for securing the lower weldment to the upper hub, a third clamp and stud/nut assembly for securing the lower hub to the lower weldment, mechanisms for introducing fluid under high pressure for testing an injector element, and mechanisms for purging the apparatus to prevent frosting of view glasses within the window housings and to permit unobstructed viewing of the injector element...|$|R

40|$|Improved ground-imaging {{capabilities}} {{have enormous}} potential to increase energy, environmental, and economic benefits by improving exploration accuracy and reducing energy consumption during the mining cycle. Seismic tomography {{has been used}} successfully to monitor and evaluate geologic conditions ahead of a mining face. A primary limitation to existing seismic tomography, however, is the placement of sensors. The goal of this project is to develop an array of 24 seismic sensors capable of being mounted in either a vertical or horizontal borehole. Development of this technology reduces energy usage in excavation, transportation, ventilation, and processing phases of the mining operation because less waste is mined and the mining cycle suffers fewer interruptions. This new technology benefits all types of mines, including metal/nonmetal, coal, and quarrying. The primary research tasks focused on sensor placement method, sensor <b>housing</b> and <b>clamping</b> design, and cabling and connector selection. An initial design is described in the report. Following assembly, a prototype was tested in the laboratory {{as well as at}} a surface stone quarry. Data analysis and tool performance were used for subsequent design modifications. A final design is described, of which several components are available for patent application. Industry partners have shown clear support for this research and demonstrated an interest in commercialization following project completion...|$|R
40|$|Boring bar {{vibration}} in {{machine tools}} during internal turning operations is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Due to the often slender geometry of the boring bar, vibration may easily be induced by the material deformation process. One approach to overcome such vibration problems is to use active control of boring bar vibration. The design time of an active boring bar depends {{to a great extent}} on the knowledge of its dynamic properties when clamped in a lathe for different actuator positions and sizes, crucial for its performance. This thesis focuses on the development of accurate dynamic models of active boring bars with the purpose of providing qualitative information on suitable actuator position for a certain boring bar. The first part of the thesis considers the problem of building an accurate " 3 -D" finite element (FE) model of a standard boring bar used in industry. Results from experimental modal analysis of the actual boring bar are the reference. The second and the third parts discuss analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a boring bar clamped in a machine tool. For this purpose, the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are used to produce both distributed-parameter system models and corresponding " 1 -D" FE models. A more complete " 3 -D" FE model of the system boring bar - <b>clamping</b> <b>house</b> is also developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar clamped in a machine tool. The third part also investigates the sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived boring bar models to variation in the structural parameters' values. The fourth part focuses on the development of a " 3 -D" FE model of the system boring bar - actuator - <b>clamping</b> <b>house.</b> Two models are discussed: a linear model and a model enabling variable contact between the <b>clamping</b> <b>house</b> and the boring bar with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models fundamental bending modes and control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active boring bar. In the fifth part, a method based on FE modeling and artificial neural networks for selecting a suitable actuator position inside an active boring bar is presented. Objective functions for selecting an actuator position are suggested. An active boring bar with an actuator position suggested by the method was manufactured and it displays fairly good correlation with the corresponding FE model. The final part focuses on modeling of an active boring bar vibration control system. A simple " 1 -D" FE model of a boring bar is utilized to simulate the dynamic response and an adaptive digital feedback controller realized by the feedback filtered-x LMS algorithm is used...|$|R
40|$|The {{boring bar}} {{is one of}} the most widely used type of tool holders in metal cutting operations. The turning process {{subjects}} the tool to vibrations, and cutting in deep workpiece cavities is likely to result in high vibration levels. The consequences of such vibration levels generally results in: reduced tool life, poor surface finishing and disturbing sound. Internal turning frequently requires a long and slender boring bar in order to machine inside a cavity, and the vibrations generally become highly correlated with one of the fundamental bending modes of the boring bar. Different methods can be applied to reduce the vibrations, the implementation of the most efficient and stable methods require in depth knowledge concerning the dynamic properties of the tooling system. Furthermore, the interface between the boring bar and the <b>clamping</b> <b>house</b> has a significant influence on the dynamic properties of the clamped boring bar.

40|$|Vibration {{problems}} occurring during {{internal turning}} {{operations in the}} manufacturing industry urge for adequate passive and/or active control techniques {{in order to increase}} the productivity of machine tools. Usually, passive solutions are based on either boring bars made partly in high Young's modulus non-ductile materials such as intered tungsten carbide or boring bars with tuned vibration absorbers adjusted to increase the dynamic stiffness in the frequency range of a certain resonance frequency of the boring bar. By utilizing an active boring bar with an embedded piezoceramic actuator and a suitable controller, the primary boring bar vibrations originating from the material deformation process may be suppressed with actuator-induced secondary "anti-" vibrations. In order to design an active boring bar, several issues have to be addressed, i. e., selecting the characteristics of the actuator, the actuator size, the position of the actuator in the boring bar, etc. This usually implies the manufacturing and testing of several prototypes of an active boring bar, and this is a time-consuming and costly procedure. Therefore, mathematical models of active boring bars incorporating the piezo-electric effect that enable the accurate prediction of their dynamic properties and responses are of great importance. This report addresses the development of a " 3 -D" finite element model of the system "boring bar-actuator-clamping house". The spatial dynamic properties of the active boring bar, i. e., its natural frequencies and mode shapes, as well as the transfer function between actuator voltage and boring bar acceleration are calculated based on the " 3 -D" FE model and compared to the corresponding experimentally obtained estimates. Two types of approximations of the Coulomb friction force, the arctangent and the bilinear models, are evaluated concerning modeling contact between the surface of the boring bar and the <b>clamping</b> <b>house...</b>|$|R
40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to clamped parts. There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring clamping force involved the use of load washers or miniature load cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated spring clamps have also been used. Load washers and miniature load cells constitute additional clamped parts in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. Spring clamps can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing the clamping force and the circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all <b>housed</b> on the <b>clamp.</b> In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package. The advantage of unitary packaging of such a system is that it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease...|$|R
40|$|Boring bar {{vibration}} during {{internal turning}} operations in machine tools is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Vibration may easily be induced by the workpiece’s material deformation process, due to the bar’s normally slender geometry. In order to overcome the vibration problem in internal turning active or/and passive control methods may be utilized. The level of success achieved by implementing such methods is directly dependent on the engineer’s knowledge of the dynamic properties of the system to be controlled. This thesis focuses predominantly on three steps {{in the development of}} an accurate model of an active boring bar. The first part considers the problem of building an accurate ” 3 -D” FE model of a standard boring bar used in industry. The influence of the FE model’s mesh density on the accuracy of the estimated spatial dynamic properties is addressed. With respect to the boring bar’s natural frequencies, the FE modeling also considers mass loading effects introduced by accelerometers attached to the boring bar. Experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar are used as a reference. The second part discusses analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a boring bar clamped in a machine tool. For this purpose, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko distributedparameter system models are used to describe the dynamics of the boring bar. Also, ” 1 -D” FE models with Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements have been developed in accordance with distributedparameter system models. A more complete ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring bar - clamping house” has also been developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar clamped in the machine tool. This section also investigates sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived boring bar models to variation in the structural parameters’ values. The final part focuses on the development of a ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring bar - actuator - clamping house”, with the purpose of simplifying the design procedure of an active boring bar. A linear model is addressed along with a model enabling variable contact between the <b>clamping</b> <b>house</b> and the boring bar with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models’ fundamental bending modes, eigenfrequencies and mode shapes, control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active boring bar...|$|R
