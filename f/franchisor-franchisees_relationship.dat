40|$|The Nigerian {{franchise}} sector {{witnessed a}} rapid growth {{at the turn}} of the century, from 2001 to 2010, and thereafter started declining. Disputes, relational conflicts, and high rate of outlets closure have characterized the industry over the years. Meanwhile, studies show that to a large extent, success of franchisees depends on the quality of relationship they have with their franchisors. No prior empirical study has investigated the cause of the increasing relationship disputes in the Nigerian franchise industry. This investigation aims to explore the key relationship factors that influence franchisees’ overall satisfaction and intention to stay. Personal interview involving 26 franchisees was used to collect data from different franchise brands across Nigeria. Four factors emerged strongly as the antecedents of the relationship problem in the franchise system. Answering the calls of many scholars for studies in different cultures and settings on <b>franchisor-franchisees</b> <b>relationship,</b> this study provides the first-ever empirical insights into the relationship dynamics between franchisors and franchisees in Nigeria, thereby helping to strengthen the theory in the subject. The study offers some recommendations that will potentially help in reviving the industry for the benefit of the stakeholders and the economy at large...|$|E

40|$|The <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> {{is unique}} in that it has {{characteristics}} of both an arm’s length business transaction {{as well as an}} ongoing business relationship. As time goes by, however, the interests of the parties may diverge. It is in the franchisees’ interest to make their individual units as profitable as possible while, conversely, franchisors also profit from the licensing of the trademark and the collection of royalties from all their franchisees. For example, {{an increase in the number}} of stores in a given market will likely benefit the franchisor, whereas the same expansion may dilute the profitability of a particular franchisee through encroachment. The parties’ interests, thus, become misaligned. We argue that that, in addition to increased disclosure under Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules, the misalignments in the <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> can be addressed by taking a more self-regulatory approach that recasts the duties owed among the parties. The FTC regulations focus on greater disclosure and as government regulations the rules are aimed at external incentives and protecting of the party that is perceived as having less leverage and (i. e., the franchisee). We argue for a more fiduciary duty-like <b>relationship</b> for <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> and look at two somewhat related ways that the relationship is “self-regulated” by the market and, thus, the parties. We first examine the time-tested mechanism of fiduciary duties imposed by the courts as an additional balancing mechanism to supplement the mere disclosure under the FTC. Second, we examine the equitable standards applied to restrictive covenants, such as non-compete agreements and non-disclosure (confidentiality) agreements as a further reference point for how the common law can provide guidance on the boundaries of the <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship.</b> We conclude that this mix of court intervention to impose fiduciary duties and the existing FTC regulation is sensible because the parties are in a relatively long-term, well-defined relationship in which the initial disclosure under the FTC rules is insufficient...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Franchise {{literature}} disputes how {{the relationship}} between franchisors and franchisees develops over time. Traditional lifecycle theory views relationships following an ascendant curve, in which relationship quality and performance strengthen over time.

Using a self-report survey from a sample of 342 franchisees, mean and regression analyses are conducted to test relationships.

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that limited {{attention has been paid}} to business-to-business (B 2 B) branding. Despite compelling evidence that the brand concept is at the very core of franchising success, it is surprising that there is minimal empirical work investigating the importance of the brand in franchising. Further, extant literature suggests that building brand equity is an important strategic issue that can enhance the competitive advantage of retailers. However, despite the increased focus on retail branding, limited {{attention has been paid to}} retail brand equity and brand equity within B 2 B retailing contexts, especially in franchising. As a result, grounded in social exchange, transaction cost, relational equity, competence-based and identity-based brand management views, this study investigates the role of brand relationship management, brand relationship quality, and brand citizenship behaviour in enhancing brand equity in franchise markets. The study explores franchisees’ perceptions of their franchise brands leading to a new model of ‘franchisee-based brand equity’ (FBBE). In particular, the study argues that as a special form of retailing, franchising calls for its own theories other than those applied in other contexts. The study also proposes that the effect of brand relationships on brand equity is moderated by both <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> duration and franchisor competence. Additional analysis is also conducted to examine the effects of brand relationships on FBBE across low vs. high value franchisees and single-unit vs. multi-unit franchisees. To test the franchisee-based brand equity model, the study used both qualitative and quantitative research designs. Initially, exploratory research was undertaken to investigate the research problem and validate the constructs of the proposed conceptual model. To accomplish this, sixteen (16) semi-structured interviews were conducted with franchise experts, particularly franchisees. The main study was then conducted using a quantitative research design and survey data was collected from 352 franchisees Australia-wide selected using a stratified random sampling technique. Structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures were then used to test the hypothesised relationships in the conceptual model and regression techniques were used to test for mediation and moderation effects. Based on the literature review, the qualitative study, and the empirical findings from the quantitative study, a model is advanced that suggests that brand relationship management influences brand relationship quality and brand citizenship behaviour that ultimately enhances FBBE. The study finds that effective management of brand relationships is critical in promoting FBBE. Further, the study confirms that both brand relationship quality and brand citizenship behaviour mediates the relationship between brand relationship management and FBBE. Moreover, moderated mediation analyses indicate that the indirect effect of brand relationship management on FBBE through brand relationship quality is contingent on franchisor competence but not on the duration of the <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship.</b> Conversely, the indirect effect of brand relationship management on FBBE through brand citizenship behaviour is not conditional on either franchisor competence or <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> duration. In addition, the study finds that franchisors play an important role in empowering franchisee brand citizenship behaviour. Moreover, the results show that both <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> duration and franchisor competence do not moderate the relationship between brand citizenship behaviour and FBBE. However, the study partially supports the moderating effects of both <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> duration and franchisor competence on the link between brand relationship quality and FBBE. Lastly, regarding the influence of brand relationships on FBBE, the comparative analyses show no differences between low and high value franchises, while significant differences are apparent between single-unit and multi-unit franchisees. In terms of academic contribution, the study conceptualises, operationalises and empirically investigates the concept of brand relationship management, brand relationship quality and brand citizenship behaviour to advance a novel model of franchisee-based brand equity. In so doing, the current study expands the current understandings of brand equity in B 2 B markets. Further, the study applies the identity-based brand management view to explain how brand relationships enhance franchisee-based brand equity, thereby extending the application of organisational identity theories to franchising. The study also examines the concept of brand relationships in B 2 B markets, a concept that has dominated consumer markets. Brand management in franchise channels remains a multifaceted and challenging issue; thus, to managers, this study identifies different roles played by franchise partners in enhancing brand equity. Hence, the study seeks to advise practitioners that brand management in franchise firms should be well-coordinated and integrated between franchisors and franchisees since both play crucial roles. Another important implication for practice relates to the importance of brand relationship management in B 2 B brand management. Central to the concept of brand relationship management is the notion that negative emotions and feelings towards the brand can negatively influence franchise relationships. Therefore, franchisors are advised to promote a healthy relationship between franchisees and the franchise brand. Moreover, the study seeks to inform managers that brand relationships can be managed at two stages, that is, recruitment and implementation. Franchisors are also advised that ‘age is nothing but just a number’ and need to be cognisant of the ‘dark side’ of long term relationships. Thus, regardless of whether relationships are short or long term, the continuous development of effective brand relationship practices is paramount in enhancing brand equity. Regarding research limitations, the context of the study has been limited to Australia, and for purposes of generalisability, future research may extend the idea in well-established franchise markets such as those in the USA and microfranchising structures in emerging markets such as India. Also, franchising as a freedom-constrained environment might suppress the expression of other brand-related behaviours and further research is needed to explore other un-identified variables that might affect extra-role channel behaviour, in other principal-agent relationships such as employer-employee relationships. Further, the study examined two moderating variables (<b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> duration and franchisor competence) and other factors such as brand involvement level, centralisation or decentralisation of authority, competitive intensity or country-of-origin effects could be evaluated. Lastly, the FBBE model is based on franchisees’ perceptions and the inclusion of franchisors’ interpretations is likely to result in a more robust model of franchise brand equity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Although Australian {{franchising}} sector regulation promotes system {{disclosure and}} provides for mandatory conflict mediation, {{there is some}} concern that inequities exist within the conflict management process. From 2006 to 2008 no less than four government inquiries into franchising took place in Australia {{in an attempt to}} resolve problems occurring in the sector. A major issue was that of the perceived imbalance of power in the <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship,</b> which often results in conflict between the two parties. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend the conflict literature in dyadic exchange relationships through investigating the causes of conflict from the franchisor and franchisee perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - Exploratory research is undertaken to identify the major causes of franchising conflict. Face-to-face interviews are conducted with 24 franchising experts, such as lawyers and mediators, to draw upon their considerable experience in the sector. Findings - The key findings suggest that a lack of due diligence is associated with the formation of unrealistic expectations which increases the potential for future relational conflict. Although franchising experience impacts upon operational approaches and conflict, the role played by third parties and market conditions both appear to exacerbate dissatisfaction in franchise systems. Research limitations/implications - This research is exploratory and therefore the findings are tentative. The preliminary conceptual models will be tested in a large quantitative survey of key franchising stakeholders in the near future. Originality/value - With the Australian franchising sector presently under intense scrutiny by regulators this research is timely and important. It is expected that the findings will provide government and industry representatives with a more balanced understanding of the causes of franchising conflict so that preventative action may be taken.

40|$|Franchising is not {{particularly}} well researched topic in organizational economics. However, its economic importance is significant. For example, the total revenue of franchising in the US is now approximately 50 % of all retail trade. A typical franchising chain consists of units that are operated by the franchisees {{but there are also}} centrally managed units? Which ones are managed centrally and why? Some of the prior research on the matter is incomplete. The research question of this thesis is: “What factors tend to determine which units of a typical franchising chain are centrally managed?” The main issue of focus in this study is the free riding problems that arise in environments where the franchisee is not compelled to work {{in the best interests of}} the franchisor. The objectives of this study are threefold. The goal is to (1) write a thorough literature review on the theory of the firm in order to understand franchising as an organizational form, (2) develop a model describing the <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationship</b> and (3) perform a case type empirical analysis on one typical franchising chain to test two hypotheses derived from the theoretical model. The target of the empirical research in this study is McDonald’s, a well established franchising chain with a valuable brand. The data used in the research is collected from three main sources: Interviewing the franchising director of McDonald’s Finland, searching public web pages and using an internet based service solution for maps (Eniro). Also, a particular qualitative index for metropolitan context was created. It was used to estimate the influence of the franchisees operating environment to the business. A logistic regression model was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The sample size comprises 84 restaurants. The underlying assumption in the empirical research is that an established franchisor has learned an efficient ownership allocation for its units. The key results from the theoretical model are interesting and together with the analyzed theory motivate two hypotheses. According to these hypotheses, this ownership allocation is as a function of operating environment and monitoring costs. The empirical results supported the proposed hypotheses: the likelihood for a given McDonald’s restaurant to be owned and operated by the franchisor decreases the closer the unit is to the headquarter (monitoring costs) and the higher the metropolitan index is for that given location (environment). Even though the sample size was not large, the results are statistically significant. The study is concluded with three propositions, suggestions for future research and recommendations for franchising firms. Endast sammandrag.

The {{business}} {{literature has}} long heralded franchising as an economically efficient business strategy for sustainable job, wealth and value creation, economic transformation {{and small business}} development. However, opportunism, being the tendency of the parties involved in the franchise relationship to act in their self-interest at each other’s expense resulting in misaligned incentives, may undermine the long-term efficacy of the franchising system. Such opportunism may be enacted at different times by either the franchisor or the franchisee. For the above reasons, this thesis focuses {{on the role of}} opportunism, a key aspect of Transactions Cost Economics theory, within the franchising system. Following an extensive review of the franchising, opportunism and related literatures, the thesis goes on to theorising and investigating a two-dimensional conceptualisation of opportunism, namely ‘opportunistic orientations’ and ‘opportunistic actions’. Secondly, the thesis theorises and investigates various key antecedents and consequences of opportunistic orientations (OO) and opportunistic actions (OA) from the perspectives of both franchisors and franchisees. Ultimately, this thesis proposes an integrated model combining structural, contextual and strategic factors as antecedents affecting OO which, in turn, leads to OA. The model further proposes that OA impact the growth, competitiveness and survival of franchise systems. In order to test this model, this thesis used a mixed methods strategy to undertake empirical fieldwork conducted separately among x franchisors and franchisees. The franchisor study was based on questionnaire data gathered from 111 purposefully sampled franchisors analysed principally through multivariate correlational techniques including structural equation modelling and canonical correlations. The franchisee study involved gathering semi-structured interview data from a purposeful sample of 30 Johannesburg-based franchisees, analysed through content analysis. To a large extent, while the results of the empirical fieldwork supports the proposed model as outlined above, the results of the franchisor study produced some unexpected outcomes. These relate mainly to the findings that structural and strategic factors directly affected the competitiveness of franchise systems and that contextual and strategic factors also directly affected the growth and survival of franchise systems and not through the intervening variables, that is, OO and OA. These findings suggest that structural, contextual and strategic factors may create entrepreneurial orientations (EO) and not OO within franchise systems. Nevertheless, this thesis makes several important and unique contributions to the study of franchising in South Africa, possibly with broader applications elsewhere, which include the following: - extending the opportunism construct by conceptualising the OO notion which helps to increase understanding of the manifestation of opportunism as a central problem within franchise relationships; xi - examining the antecedents and consequences of OO and OA in the same model to test the opportunism-performance hypothesis probably as the first study to do so among franchisors and franchisees in general and particularly in this country and continent; - applying TCE and RET theories to explain OO and OA and strategies to curb or minimise it within franchise relationships; and - incorporating some aspects of the country’s marriage laws into the franchise relationship to provide for secured tenure among franchisees by expunging the expiry clauses from franchise contractsWithin the context of Relational Exchange Theory, this thesis mainly and uniquely suggests the use of: - psychological contracts between franchisors and franchisees to help align the incentives of these parties largely through mutually agreed norms of acceptable behaviour, role expectations and objectives; - independent and statutory bodies such as the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), law societies and medical or nursing councils as dispute resolution mechanisms to help mediate or resolve franchising disputes fairly, quickly and cheaply; and xii - “evergreen” franchise contracts which make no provision for expiry clauses to attenuate opportunism among franchisees through secured tenure. On the whole, this thesis recommends the use of the above interventions as governance mechanisms to help improve <b>franchisor-franchisee</b> <b>relationships</b> and the reputation of franchising in South Africa by aligning the incentives of the parties and creating an environment in which franchise relationships can flourish. Finally, the thesis also implores future researchers to investigate the impact of existing legislation such as the Consumer Protection Act and the measures suggested above on franchising in this country {{and the rest of the}} continent; and the relationship between EO and the growth, competitiveness and survival of franchise systems...|$|R
