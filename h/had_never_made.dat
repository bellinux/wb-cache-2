Wade hit just seven shots from beyond the arc during the entire 2015–16 regular season. However, the 2016 postseason saw a change in Wade's play. He converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts before missing his first one during a Game 3 loss to the Toronto Raptors in the conference semi-finals. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Wade <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> more than five three-pointers in a row during his career.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ {{stated that}} they would {{discontinue}} Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. The {{only part of the}} service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E

He was supported in this by Richard Crossman but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.|$|E

25|$|By October 1993, despite {{more than}} 3 million {{visitors}} a year, OPOJV was behind on its rent to GSA and in default on its mortgage to Collin Equities (a subsidiary of Wells Fargo).

25|$|The {{origin of}} {{the stars and stripes}} design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the {{descendants}} of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870. By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776. Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.|$|E
25|$|While the Carpenters disdained {{industrial}} unionism, {{they were}} willing to accept mass production workers into their own union, albeit as second-class members. The Carpenters had fought with the Wood Workers union chartered by the AFL for decades, claiming that any workers who planed wood products that were subsequently used in construction, such as doors, sashes, mouldings and the like, were performing carpenters' work and must be brought within its union. While the Carpenters <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> similar claims on work performed by sawmill workers, much less tried to organize them, the union successfully insisted that the AFL assign the newly created Sawmill and Timber Workers’ Union to it in 1935. That forced marriage was not successful, as most of these workers soon bolted to form the International Woodworkers of America and to join the CIO several years later after a recognition strike.|$|E

25|$|Being {{tough on}} crime was a major plank of Pataki's {{campaign}} for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 11 years Pataki had served as governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous {{state in the nation}} to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York’s criminal statutes. In 1995, Governor Pataki was able to uphold a campaign promise by reinstating capital punishment in New York with the Sentencing Reform Act. The reinstatement of the death penalty was later suspended by the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) in a 4–3 decision. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest gun control laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it in a bipartisan effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of Megan's Law and Kendra's Law were integrated into New York's laws under the governor {{as well as a number}} of reforms to the Rockefeller Drug Laws. The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates' ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.|$|E

500|$|Both sides lost {{close to}} 28,000 men, to wounds and death. For Napoleon, whose force was smaller, the losses were more costly. For Charles, the victory, which {{occurred}} within visual {{range of the}} Vienna ramparts, won him support from the hawks, or the pro-war party, in the Hofburg. [...] The Austrian victory at Aspern-Essling proved that Napoleon could be beaten. His force had been divided (Davout's corps <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it over the Danube), and Napoleon had underestimated the Austrian strength of force and, more importantly, the tenacity the Austrians showed in situations like that of Essling, when Klenau marched his force across open country under enemy fire. After Aspern-Essling, Napoleon revised his opinion of the Austrian soldier.|$|E
500|$|Ibn Ali {{remained}} an obscure figure until his only released recording, The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan, which was recorded on December 4 and 7, 1964, and released six months later. The trio contained Roach and bassist Art Davis, and the album consisted of seven tracks, all written by Ibn Ali. The recording opportunity was initiated by Roach, who used his influence {{with the owner}} of Atlantic Records to secure the session for Ibn Ali. Alan Sukoenig, in his liner notes to the album, wrote [...] "For a while it appeared that it was Hasaan Ibn Ali's destiny to be known – {{to those who had}} heard of him at all – as the extraordinary jazz pianist from Philadelphia who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a record." [...] After the album, Ibn Ali returned to obscurity.|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} filming, Rebecca Eaton {{noticed the}} growing [...] "buzz" [...] {{surrounding}} Austen and costume dramas in Hollywood.

Sony Pictures Classics saw a cut of the adaptation and requested permission to show it in American cinemas, releasing it on 27 September 1995. There, it was characterised as an [...] "art-house" [...] film, with a small niche audience. It was shown at the Toronto and Chicago International Film Festivals. Persuasion earned $56,000 in its first week of release in New York, and grossed $150,000 in Los Angeles. The total US gross was $5,269,757. It was less financially successful than the popular Sense and Sensibility, which was released in cinemas several months later. The film was released in VHS format on 12 November 1996; a DVD version followed on 1 February 2000.|$|E

500|$|Bryan's {{speech is}} {{considered}} one of the most powerful political addresses in American history. Stanley Jones, however, suggested that even if Bryan <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it, he would still have been nominated. Jones deemed the Democrats likely to nominate a candidate who would appeal to the Populist Party, and Bryan had been elected to Congress with Populist support. According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study of the rhetoric of the 1896 campaign, [...] "Bryan's speech cast a net for the true believers, but only for the true believers." [...] Harpine suggested that, [...] "by appealing in such an uncompromising way to the agrarian elements and to the West, Bryan neglected the national audience who would vote in the November election". [...] Bryan's emphasis on agrarian issues, both in his speech and in his candidacy, may have helped cement voting patterns which kept the Democrats largely out of power until the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Thomas of Bayeux (died [...] 1100) was Archbishop of York from 1070 until 1100. He {{was educated}} at Liège {{and became a}} royal {{chaplain}} to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King WilliamI of England. After the Norman Conquest, the king nominated Thomas to succeed Ealdred as Archbishop of York. After Thomas' election, Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; {{this was part of}} Lanfranc's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed.|$|E
500|$|Before {{founding}} Beecher's, Dammeier <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> cheese, and {{had little}} direct knowledge of the cheese making business. His self-described [...] "passion" [...] for cheese began during his childhood in Tacoma, Washington, where his family always kept a cheese board piled high with local cheeses. Raised in a family business involving printing and food manufacturing, he decided to open a cheese business after his family sold the printing company. He named it for his great-grandfather, Beecher McKenzie. Dammeier also owns the Seattle-based specialty grocer Pasta & Co. and is a major investor in Pyramid Breweries, Inc.; {{other members of his}} family have stakes in Pyramid as well. Dammeier also founded Bennett's Pure Food Bistro on nearby Mercer Island, and the food truck Maximus/Minimus, both of which carry many dishes prepared with Beecher's products. In 2003, Dammeier opened Beecher's in Seattle's Pike Place Market when a rare large retail location became available in the market after the nursery Molbak's closed its Market location and moved to its current Woodinville, Washington property.|$|E
