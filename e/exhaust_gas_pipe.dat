40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to report a {{discharging}} method of high pressure exhaust gas by means of a shock wave confinement in a duct. The duct, which is connected to an <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipe,</b> has inlet and exit orifices so that the flow is doubly choked at these sections. For analytical purposes, the flow in the duct is assumed to be a fanno flow with a normal shock wave. The calculated results show that the total pressure reduction increases with a decreasing opening area of the inlet orifice, and the shock wave confinement in the duct can be achieved by decreasing the opening area of the exit orifice. An experimental investigation has also been performed using a shock tunnel, and the experimental results show the validity of the present discharging method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{article is}} focused on local stress {{simulation}} {{as well as local}} deformation analysis in a cylinder of piston combustion engine. Design of the exhaust pipe system has to fulfill special requirements with regard to the combined loading due to high pressures and temperatures. There is a special role of the exhaust pipe barrier, which is situated in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipe.</b> This barrier separates the main air hole from the secondary lateral auxiliary air holes. The exhaust pipe barrier seems to be a critical point of the cylinder. The finite-element analysis applied on the silumin-cast cylinder is presented in the paper in order to prove the critical places with high stress concentration. The local strength of the cylinder material was estimated using a material model based on relation between the strength and the mean distance between the secondary dendrite arms (SDAS) in the as-cast microstructure. Due to local heterogeneities there are differences in the local strength value at the various places of the microstructure. The simulation of stress distribution was performed by use of the finite-element method. Based on the relation „local stress/local strength “ the individual critical places in the cylinder were defined and located...|$|E

They can easily be imple-mented as heat exchangers inside sorption and vapour-compression heat pumps, refrigerators {{and other types of}} heat transfer devices. Their heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator and condenser zones is 103 – 105 W/m 2 K, heat pipe thermal resistance is 0. 01 – 0. 03 K/W, therefore leading to smaller area and mass of heat exchangers.

50|$|A {{mechanically}} operated bellows injects a jet of {{air into}} the first chamber where ignition will take place. Mechanical timing lets fall a measured amount of powder fuel into the jet {{so that it is}} blown along and mixed with it. Under the control of the mechanical timing mechanism a smoldering fuse is introduced to this fuel air jet at the precise moment it passes the fuse location. The fuse then withdraws behind a metal plate. The now burning ball of powder and air travels though a wide nozzle into the main combustion chamber where a fast, almost explosive, burn takes place. The whole system now being almost airtight, a build-up of pressure follows. The pressure acts against the column of water in the exhaust pipe and expels it from the system. As the flow of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> moves into the tail pipe, it moves a loose piston in the combustion chamber which extracts and stores sufficient power to work the machines timing mechanisms. Energy from this piston is stored by lifting weights attached to a balance wheel. The return of this wheel to its lower position under the pull of the weights governs the timing for the next cycle by operating the bellows, fuel dispenser, the fuse and valves at the correct points in the cycle. The tail pipe, being under the boat, fills with water ready for the next discharge. The fall of the timing piston also expels the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> via a <b>pipe</b> above the ignition chamber, which is closed off by a valve during the burn part of the cycle.|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} {{prototype for}} vehicle <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> noise reduction is proposed: {{the system is}} based on an active noise control technique. A loudspeaker generates the canceling noise which is generated by a DSP based numerical algorithm. Canceling noise signal is emitted inside a custom pipe which is coaxial to the final segment of vehicle exhaust duct; disturbing noise and canceling noise destructively interfere at the exhaust duct outlet section; outgoing noise is thus reduced. The theoretical investigation upon the acoustic performances of the prototype has been carried out by adopting the electrical equivalent circuit approach; each acoustic element has been associated to an equivalent electrical component: air volume canceling noise propagates through has been modeled by an equivalent electrical circuit. Exhaust gas duct behavior is associated to an electrical inductance. Prototype transfer function has been estimated by an electrical circuit simulation software.

40|$|Ignition and {{combustion}} {{aids are}} added to the fuel for the regeneration of particle filters in the exhaust gas of Diesel engines. The method of action of these additives on particle ignition and oxidation in the particle filter is to be examined. The method of action of particle ignition in soot filters supported by fuel additives was examined in the engine experiment and by determination of the rate of reaction of the particles on the thermal balance. Particle combustion supported by additives is based on an ignition function of active components, local increase in the energy level by oxidation of hydrocarbons deposited on the soot and soot activation by metals/metal oxides. Wall contact of active components, reduction of deposited hydrocarbons on the soot by an increase in temperature or by catalysts and slight contact between carbon and metal oxides due to crystal growth of the metal oxides reduce the effect of the additives. At low additive concentrations, a regeneration gap can occur at filter temperatures of 350 - 400 degrees C, where the hydrocarbons deposited on the soot are missing and the temperature is not sufficient for soot oxidation by solid-solid catalysis. With higher additive concentration, the probability of regeneration increases and the regeneration gap closes. The following is recommended for the construction of particle filter systems with additive regeneration: the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> in front of the filter should be short. At low load, the quantity of hydrocarbons with high boiling point should be high. The additive concentration in the range of 250 - 400 degrees C should be adapted by additive dosing controlled by the characteristic, in order that no regeneration gap will be createdZur Regeneration von Partikelfiltern im Abgas von Dieselmotoren werden Zuend- und Brennhilfen als Additive dem Kraftstoff zugegeben. Es soll die Wirkungsweise dieser Additive auf die Partikelzuendung und Oxidation im Partikelfilter untersucht werden. Die Wirkungsweise der durch Kraftstoffzusaetze (Additive) unterstuetzten Partikelzuendung in Russfiltern wurde im Motorversuch sowie durch Bestimmung der Reaktionsrate der Partikeln auf der Thermowaage untersucht. Additivunterstuetzte Partikelverbrennung beruht auf einer Zuendfunktion aktiver Komponenten, einer oertlichen Erhoehung des Energieniveaus durch Oxidation am Russ angelagerter Kohlenwasserstoffe und einer Russaktivierung durch Metalle/Metalloxide. Wandkontakt aktiver Komponenten, Verminderung angelagerter Kohlenwasserstoffe am Russ durch Temperatursteigerung oder Katalysatoren und geringer Kontakt zwischen Kohlenstoff- und Metalloxiden infolge Kristallwachstum der Metalloxide vermindern die Additivwirkung. Bei niedrigen Additivkonzentrationen kann eine Regenerationsluecke bei Filtertemperaturen von 350 C- 400 C entstehen, in der die am Russ angelagerten Kohlenwasserstoffe fehlen und die Temperatur zur Russoxidation durch Fest-Fest-Katalyse nicht ausreicht. Mit hoeherer Additivkonzentration nimmt die Regenerationswahrscheinlichkeit zu und die Regenerationsluecke schliesst sich. Fuer den Aufbau von Partikelfiltersystemen mit Additivregeneration wird empfohlen: Die Abgasleitung vor dem Filter sollte kurz sein. Bei niedriger Last sollte die Menge hochsiedender Kohlenwasserstoffe hoch sein. Die Additivkonzentration im Bereich um 250 C- 400 C sollte z. B. durch kennfeldgesteuerte Additivdosierung angepasst werden, um keine Regenerationsluecke entstehen zu lassen. (orig.)
