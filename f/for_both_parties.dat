Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as in Congo, Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, East Timor and Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based approach by adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties.</b> In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business.|$|E

He was third in command in Ukraine's CPSU leadership before the fall of Soviet Union even though he didn't belong to the ruling Dnipropetrovsk group.

5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> throughout the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In November 1835, an {{expedition}} led by Governor James Stirling joined another party {{led by the}} Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in King George Sound.

5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties.</b> Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E

25|$|The {{negotiations}} were largely {{motivated by the}} juggernaut takeover of the Liberal Party by the extremely popular and successful former Liberal finance minister Paul Martin, and the marked reduction in membership and political donations <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> due to voter frustration {{with the status quo}} Liberal hegemony. Polls showed both the beleaguered PC and Alliance parties losing a large number of seats in the next election to a Martin-led Liberal team across Canada if an amenable solution was not found.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electorate}} returning {{two members}} (simultaneously), the quota (for successful candidacy), (33.34%) is easy <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> in a two-party-dominated assembly to reach if their core demographic voter base exceeds the quota. For example, the Territories in the Australian Senate have always returned one member {{from each of}} the two major parties. In an electorate returning three members, electoral stasis occurs when the weaker party is able to gain a quota (25.01%). The more popular party will then win two seats and the weaker party one seat.|$|E

25|$|By 1615 and 1625, Cossacks {{had managed}} to raze townships on the {{outskirts}} of Constantinople, forcing the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV to flee his palace. His nephew, Sultan Mehmed IV, fared little better as the recipient of the legendary Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, a ribald response to Mehmed's insistence that the Cossacks submit to his authority. Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth called <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> to keep the Cossacks and Tatars in check, but enforcement was almost non-existent on both sides. In internal agreements, forced by the Poles, the Cossacks agreed to burn their boats and stop raiding.
