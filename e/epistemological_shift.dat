In this paper I offer a situated comparison of two different perspectives that agree on the need for shifting conceptualisations of knowledge and learning in education: one concerned with cognitive adaptation and another with epistemological pluralism. Both perspectives align in their conceptualisation of knowledge, learning, reality and identities as socially constructed, fluid, open to negotiation and always provisional and in the call for <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> away from universalism. However, they are motivated by different conceptualisations of social problems and envisaged solutions.

During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology.

50|$|Under this assumption, which {{requires}} an <b>epistemological</b> <b>shift</b> from empiricism, situativity theorists suggest {{a model of}} knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot {{be separated from the}} context. Instead knowing exists, in situ, inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. This perspective rejects mind-body dualism, being conceptually similar to functional contextualism, and B. F. Skinner's behavior analysis.|$|E

At the heart of this essay rest questions about what <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> are necessary vis-à-vis literature, such that an animal “voice” can be heard as a narrative voice. What would constitute a non-anthropocentric autobiography? What would constitute one narrated by, in this instance, an animal, specifically, a dog? In answering these questions, this essay at once grapples with philosophical-theoretical paradigms, with animal studies, with literary genre studies, and especially autobiography, and with narrative voice. I explore these questions with the aim of contributing to what Derrida has called zoopoetics and particularly to the study of non-anthropocentric autobiography...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{historical}} {{progression of}} the idea of ‘Rights’ and ‘Citizenship’ are embedded in a narrative, which postures itself as a Universalist in nature. The role of ‘State’ in such a narrative account cannot be over-stressed. The concept of ‘Rights’ in such a context comes across as an act of dispensation. Dispensation of ‘Justice’, such an account and its discussion problematises the almost universally accepted notions regarding ‘Human Rights’. In order to do so, some of the major <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> are identified to analyze the ‘accepted’ continuum of human thought and behaviour which are universal in nature. It would be useful here to question the ‘universal’ tenor of this kind of exercise in modern social science theories where nature has been ‘pushed’ in to the periphery.

In this shift, the means and mechanisms of international intervention have been transformed, no longer focused on the universal application of Western causal knowledge through policy interventions but rather on the effects of specific and unique local and organic processes at work in societies themselves. The focus on effects takes the conceptualisation of intervention out of the traditional terminological lexicon of International Relations theory and instead recasts problems in increasingly organicised ways, suggesting that artificial or hubristic attempts at socio-political intervention should be excluded or minimised...|$|R
40|$|It is by {{now well}} known that the modern {{category}} of religion has evolved {{as part of a}} certain trajectory of Western history. Among its many aspects, this trajectory is about how religion became part of a definitive relationship with the category of the secular – a relationship that implies an understanding of religion as something distinct – and ideally separate – from other categories such as science, politics, and law. The place of the category of religion as part of this semantic as well as institutional landscape of separations makes it relevant to probe the possible consequences for sociology, if we are, as some scholars have argued, living in contexts which are increasingly post-secular. What happens, then, to the object – as well as the self-identity – of the study of religion?

40|$|This article explores {{geographical}} and <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> in {{the deployment}} of the UK Prevent strategy, 2007 – 2017. Counter-radicalisation policies of the Labour governments (2006 – 2010) focused heavily upon resilience-building activities in residential communities. They borrowed from historical models of crime prevention and public health to imagine radicalisation risk as an epidemiological concern in areas showing a 2 % or higher demography of Muslims. However, this racialised and localised imagination of pre-criminal space was replaced after {{the election of the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Residential communities were then de-emphasised as sites of risk, transmission and pre-criminal intervention. The Prevent Duty now deploys counter-radicalisation through national networks of education and health-care provision. Localised models of crime prevention (and their statistical, crime prevention epistemologies) have been de-emphasised in favour of big data inflected epistemologies of inductive, population-wide “safeguarding”. Through the biopolitical discourse of “safeguarding vulnerable adults”, the Prevent Duty has radically reconstituted the epidemiological imagination of pre-criminal space, imagining that all bodies are potentially vulnerable to infection by radicalisers and thus warrant surveillance...|$|R

The project utilised a threshold concepts framework to explore and analyse their reported transformations during the course, with triangulation from comments by teachers and community service workers. Exploration of the data has highlighted the oscillating nature of reporting by students of the extent of change within themselves.

40|$|Mevlânâ Celâleddin Rumî, a thirteenth-century Sufi leader, is an {{important}} religious figure in the Islamic-Sufi tradition. He {{is regarded as the}} founder of the Mevlevi Order. On the other hand, Sufism has been officially banned in the Turkish Republic since 1925, which includes all Sufi lodges, and the Mevlevî order is no exception. Although the public visibility of Sufi practices had been illegal and Sufism had lost its legitimacy in modern Turkey, the Turkish State established and recognized commemorations in honour of Mevlânâ approximately two decades after launching the secular reforms banning Sufism. Today these ceremonies are held annually and attended regularly by the highest state authorities. The first commemoration was held in Konya in December 1942 {{on the occasion of the}} 670 th anniversary of Mevlânâ’s death where Mevlânâ was presented as ‘the great thinker of Anatolia’. This paper examines the intellectual and discursive context that helped legitimize the commemoration of a religious figure. Drawing on Michel Foucault and Edward Said’s theoretical insights, it analyses the cultural-intellectual debates and framings of Mevlânâ by the traditionalists, humanists, and nationalists thinkers, expressed in the speeches given at the first commemoration in 1942. Analysis suggests that <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> behind different conceptions of Mevlânâ have given way to a hybrid narrative...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} been a number of efforts to embed {{sustainability}} in higher education; progress has been slow. Transformative learning and critical thinking have appeared in the HESD literature as mechanisms to accelerate this process and foster paradigm change. The concept of critical transformative learning is linked to important and timely initiatives in higher education, yet is generally posed in broad terms, with little clarity of definition or substance, or ungrounded in pedagogical connections. This paper uses a critical epistemological analysis of relevant literature to redefine, clarify, and provide a more systematic and holistic understanding of transformative learning, its accompanying <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts,</b> and how it can be a catalyst for educating educators about sustainability. When teaching ESD, professors and students are faced with a paradox. This paradox arises when educators of ESD tend to steer students to locate themselves within the boundaries of a more or less preformed view, developing an SD consciousness formulated via a particularly essentialized conception of what being sustainable is. Such impetus of transformation of individuals and groups is being sparked by critical thinking, going beyond content and concepts, and being changed by what is learned. Critical transformative teaching and learning overcome and eliminate the paradox, and help move societies to become more sustainability oriented. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the XXI century, marketing theory has moved through a series of <b>epistemological</b> <b>shifts</b> from modern positivism to postmodern constructivism. This has resulted in a series of changes to the main concepts of “traditional” marketing such as: market, product, customer, and value. These shifts can be better viewed under a social cybernetics approach such as agency theory. This is because there is now a view that the linear concept of value creation needs to give way to the more complex process of value cocreation, where value is created collectively. Agency theory is one approach that is able to shed light on how customers and providers are able to recursively create collective value during interaction in a market. The theoretical framework provided here is able to provide improved understanding of the interactions betfween (and among) customers and providers in the value cocreation process. In this theory, value cocreation is depicted as an interactive process between a set of “living system” agencies (providers and customers) in a given market arena. The framework can be an effective tool for the managers involved in marketing to contribute to providers’ policies by supplying a clearer portrait of the systemic relations involved in the value cocreation dynamics...|$|R
