He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a [...] "football frenzy waiting to happen", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within [...] In Winkelman's own words, in a 2013 interview, he [...] "didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> football" [...] when he was proposing to move a League club from another town—indeed looking back he said [...] "it was that naivety that enabled me to go and do it." [...] He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, could tell him who was backing the plans. Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were [...] "major business people in MK and some developers. A number of major international partners who've done this sort of thing before." ...|$|E

Botvinnik was not an infallible spotter of chess talent: although {{he said of the}} 11-year-old Kasparov, [...] "The future of chess lies in the hands of this young man", he said on first seeing Karpov, [...] "The boy doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession." [...] But Karpov recounts fondly his youthful memories of the Botvinnik school and credits Botvinnik's training, especially the homework he assigned, with a marked improvement in his own play. Kasparov presents Botvinnik almost as a kind of father figure, going some way towards balancing the common public perception of Botvinnik as dour and aloof; and Kasparov inherited Botvinnik's emphasis on preparation, research and innovation. Botvinnik was still playing a major teaching role in his late 70s, when Kramnik entered the school, and made a favorable impression on his pupil.|$|E

This new application domain <b>has</b> become <b>a</b> key research topic in the robotics community. Therefore, new robots are designed to interact with people in these domains, using natural and intuitive channels. Visual perception and speech processing {{have to be considered}} for these robots, as {{they should be able to}} detect people in their environment, recognize their degree of accessibility and engage them in social conversations. They also need to safely navigate around dynamic, uncontrolled environments. They must be equipped with planning and learning components, that allow them to adapt to different scenarios. Finally, they must attract the attention of the people, be kind and safe to interact with. In this paper, we describe our experience with Gualzru, a salesman robot endowed with the cognitive architecture RoboCog. This architecture synchronizes all previous processes in a social robot, using a common inner representation as the core of the system. The robot has been tested in crowded, public daily life environments, where it interacted with people that had never seen it before nor <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> its functionality.

40|$|Energy {{coupling}} factor (ECF) transporters are a subgroup of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters {{involved in the}} uptake of vitamins and micronutrients in prokaryotes. In contrast to classical ABC importers, ECF transporters do not make use of water-soluble substrate binding proteins or domains but instead employ integral membrane proteins for substrate binding (named S-components). S-components form active translocation complexes with the ECF module, an assembly of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs, or EcfA) and a second transmembrane protein. In some cases, the ECF module is dedicated to a single S-component, but in many cases, the ECF module can interact with several different S-components that are unrelated in sequence and bind diverse substrates. The modular organization with exchangeable S-components on a single ECF module allows the transport of chemically different substrates via a common route. The recent determination of the crystal structures of the S-components that recognize thiamin and riboflavin <b>has</b> provided <b>a</b> first <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> the mechanism of S-component exchange. This review describes recent advances and the current views of the mechanism of transport by ECF transporters. ...|$|R

Springsteen shows at the Capital Centre outside of Washington, D.C. thus attracted even more media attention, in particular from CBS Evening News correspondent Bernard Goldberg, who saw Springsteen as a modern-day Horatio Alger story. Conservative columnist George Will, after attending a show, published a piece on September 13, 1984, titled [...] "A Yankee Doodle Springsteen," [...] in which he praised Springsteen as an exemplar of classic American values. [...] He wrote: [...] "I <b>have</b> not got <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> Springsteen's politics, if any, but flags get waved at his concerts while he sings songs about hard times. He is no whiner, and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always seems punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: 'Born in the U.S.A.!'" [...] The 1984 presidential campaign was in full stride at the time, and Will had connections to President Ronald Reagan's re-election organization. Will thought that Springsteen might endorse Reagan (not knowing that Springsteen did not support Reagan), and got the notion pushed up to high-level Reagan advisor Michael Deaver's office.
