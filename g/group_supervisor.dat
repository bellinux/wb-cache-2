2500|$|The {{novel was}} first {{published}} in 2011 by Vanguard Press, attributed to Donald Trump as author and Jeffrey Robinson as ghostwriter. The original cover of the novel stated, [...] "Donald J. Trump with Jeffrey Robinson". The book had the tagline: [...] "The sexiest novel of the decade". It was originally advertised as the [...] "debut novel" [...] of Donald Trump. Marketing materials said the book was within the same vein as Hotel by Arthur Hailey.> When the book was first given its initial International Standard Book Number, primary authorship was ascribed to Donald Trump. The novel was catalogued in the Library of Congress with Trump as the main author. Another edition attributed to Donald Trump was released the same year in audiobook format by Playaway Digital Audio. The cover designer of the work was Jeff Williams. Book vendors and librarians received marketing materials for the book in 2011 with its original cover featuring Trump as primary author, with Robinson's name appearing below Trump's. The literature purveyors subsequently received a notice that the original version of the work would not be sent out to them; instead they were sent a copy of the 2012 edition. Perseus Books <b>Group,</b> <b>supervisor</b> of Vanguard Press, told The Huffington Post when contacted that year, that the first published version of the title from 2011 was unavailable.|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between a systematic, media facilitated, approach for training supervisors to conduct postobservation conferences (Coaching and Counseling for Conference Improvement) and conference effectiveness. A non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design was used. The data for this study were gathered from twenty-four teacher supervisors in North Iowa during the 1983 - 84 school year. Six instruments were used to collect pretest and posttest data;The Coaching and Counseling for Conference Improvement (CCCI) training differed from the 2 ̆ 2 one shot 2 ̆ 2 inservice of the control group in that CCCI supervisors videotaped practice conferences, received critical feed back from peers, and set goals for improvement. Pretest and posttest data, including ratings of the videotaped conference performance of experimental <b>group</b> <b>supervisors,</b> were analyzed using t-tests;The study yielded four important findings: (1) Trained raters rated the skill level in conducting conferences of the experimental <b>group</b> <b>supervisors</b> significantly higher following CCCI training. (2) Supervisors trained via CCCI were significantly more self confident in their ability to conduct conferences than control <b>group</b> <b>supervisors</b> following training. (3) The skill in conducting conferences of the CCCI supervisors was rated significantly higher by teachers than was the skill of control group supervisors;No significant changes were found in conference climate of either the experimental and control groups. Experimental and control group teachers did not significantly differ on their perceptions of the potential for the conference to improve their teaching performance...|$|R

40|$|HE {{neophyte}} group therapist must cope {{not only}} with the problems inherentTin all psychotherapy but also with problems which are unique to group work. In order to understand and master these group-specific problems, the therapist should have a thorough grounding in small group dynamics-the basic science of group therapy. This article discusses common problems encountered by the beginning group therapist in terms of several important small group characteristics: 1 Group pressures; 2. Group cohesion; 3. Group development; and 4. Group leadership. The observations on which this paper is based derive from my experi-ence as a group therapist, <b>group</b> therapy <b>supervisor</b> and director, in a university out-patient setting, of a group therapy training programme for psychiatric residents. Many of the problems described occur with such frequency that they may be usefully anticipated and predicted by <b>group</b> <b>supervisors.</b> Although a modicum of anxiety with its accompanying hypervigilance may be useful, severe anxiety in the therapist impedes therapy. There is, however, an anxiety-reducing effect in the anticipation and prediction of anxiety, which may allow one to exercise mastery and maintain the anxiety within optimal limits...|$|R

One {{aspect of this}} cycle is the System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities (SETQ), which allows trainees to give feedback about their supervisor. We analysed how these quality evaluations are discussed within <b>groups</b> of <b>supervisors.</b> Questionnaire study amongst residency training program directors. From September 2013 till February 2014, an online questionnaire was distributed amongst 255 program directors of medical residency specialist training in 54 teaching hospitals. The questionnaire assessed (a) if feedback was discussed, (b) {{the purpose of the}} feedback discussions, (c) their format, (d) the perceived outcomes and (e) any need for supervisor support in relation to any future feedback discussions. The response rate for the questionnaire was 61 %. The majority of <b>supervisor</b> <b>groups</b> (86 %) followed up on their individual SETQ feedback. Formats included individually between the program director and supervisor (34 %), in a peer <b>group</b> of <b>supervisors</b> (69 %), and in group format involving both trainees and supervisors (68 %). Respondents listed the mutual learning process and devising improvement plans as aims of discussing feedback in a group format. There is considerable variation between <b>groups</b> of <b>supervisors</b> in terms of how the feedback is discussed.

50|$|Helicopters can {{hover over}} the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has {{microprocessor-controlled}} doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical <b>Group</b> <b>Supervisor)</b> aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate {{the efforts of the}} smoke jumper, helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft; while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the trajectory for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.Water is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days. This can create artificial firebreaks where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and analyse the effects of health-promoting educational interventions among employees in a municipality in Sweden. Methods: A randomized controlled educational intervention study was performed with 340 employees. Supervisors and workplace champions took part in two separate educational programmes with focus on health promotion. Intervention groups were teams of supervisors, teams of workplace champions and a mixed <b>group</b> (<b>supervisors</b> and workplace champions). The control group did not take part in any of the activities. Evaluations with physical fitness tests and a self-administrated questionnaire were performed twice. Focus group discussions were held. Results: All groups raised their physical fitness level from baseline to follow-up. Females in the <b>supervisor</b> <b>group</b> had increased their mean maximal oxygen uptake from 32. 0 mlO(2) /kg(star) min to 34. 9 mlO(2) /kg(star) min which was more than the others. Supervisors had reached increased knowledge within the area 'organizational factors' and behavioural changes had been obtained within the area 'life-style'. Workplace champions working together with their supervisors had an easier and more motivated situation than workplace champions working by themselves. Conclusions: Coaching supervisors as well as the mixed group seemed to improve the intervention of health promotion most and should be continued...|$|R
