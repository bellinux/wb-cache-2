5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where <b>is</b> <b>he?</b> <b>Not</b> heavy enough for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{election}} pitting Paul Garrett against Morgan Wendell in the novel. Wendell {{is elected}} Commissioner of Resources, and Garrett reluctantly accepts his offer {{to be his}} principal deputy. The novel also portrays Morgan Wendell as a more reasonable and balanced man than what is depicted in the miniseries. It <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> <b>not</b> Paul Garrett, who makes the reference to Warren G. Harding as the anti-standard by which all politicians should be judged.|$|E

Some time ago I left all for Sequoia {{and have been}} and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> the {{greatest}} light in the woods, in the world? Where are such columns of sunshine, tangible, accessible, terrestrialized?' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{his long}} {{ride to the}} city he assured himself in vain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing right if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sure of his {{feelings}} towards the girl.

2500|$|Regarding {{this time}} in his career, Thicke said,"The label pretty much lost faith in my ability to sell. It became a {{question}} of, 'Where does he fit? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> rock or pop enough? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> soul enough?'" [...] Pharrell Williams, having established a distribution deal with Interscope for his record label, Star Trak, expressed to Jimmy Iovine his interest in Thicke, whose talent he thought of highly. Signed to Star Trak in 2005, Thicke continued work on his second album, The Evolution of Robin Thicke. The first single, [...] "Wanna Love U Girl", featured producer Williams and charted successfully on urban radio in the United Kingdom. In 2006, a remix version of the song was filmed with rapper Busta Rhymes. Nearly {{a year after the}} single was released, the album was released on October 3, 2006. To promote the album, Thicke toured with India.Arie and then opened for John Legend in late 2006.|$|E
2500|$|When Liu Bei {{expressed}} joy {{during a}} banquet in Fu County {{to celebrate his}} success, Pang Tong chided him, saying that [...] "celebrating the invasion of others' territory isn't what a man of ren (benevolence) should do". The drunk Liu Bei retorted angrily, [...] "King Wu of Zhou also rejoiced after his victory over King Zhou of Shang. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{an example of a}} man of ren? You're wrong, so get out now!" [...] After Pang Tong left, Liu Bei regretted what he said so he invited Pang back. Pang Tong returned to his seat and did not say anything, so Liu Bei asked, [...] "When that quarrel happened just now, whose fault do you think it was?" [...] Pang Tong replied, [...] "It was both yours and mine." [...] Liu Bei laughed and the banquet continued.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the last}} three decades, a number of theologians have put forward other [...] "new perspectives" [...] on Paul's {{doctrine}} of justification, and even more specifically on what he says about justification by faith. According to Simon Gathercole, [...] "Justification by faith" [...] means God accepts Gentiles in addition to Jews, since both believe in God. Paul writes {{in his letter to}} the Romans, [...] "For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. Is God the God of Jews only? [...] <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith". Faith is the central component of Paul's doctrine of justification — meaning that Gentiles don't need to become Israelites when they convert to Christianity, because God is not just the God of one nation, but Gentile and Jew alike.|$|E

60|$|Barren fig-tree, if {{men should}} make a {{judgment}} of the care, and pains, and labour of God in his church, by the fruit that thou bringest forth, what might they say? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> slothful, is not he careless, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> without discretion?
