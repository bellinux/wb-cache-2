5|$|Although serious {{efforts were}} made to oppose <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> in Nashville as early as 1905, it was not until 1958, with the {{formation}} of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the Greenwood {{neighborhood}} of Tulsa {{was one of}} the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States. <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century, but the blacks had created a thriving area.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Territory was {{reported}} in 1892 to be around 85 percent white, 10 percent colored and 5 percent Indian. Oklahoma was awarded statehood in 1907, with a constitution that enshrined racial segregation (<b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws).</b> In 1911 the local school had 555 white students and one black.|$|E
50|$|Oklahoma's {{first black}} state legislator, A.C. Hamlin, {{was among the}} new group of state legislators, but was limited to one term by a <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law</b> passed by the legislature.|$|R
50|$|July 19, 2006 - Jackson Mayor Frank Melton {{received}} {{criticism from}} {{advocates for the}} homeless when he used the city’s emergency order to enforce a 10 p.m. curfew for the city’s homeless population. According to Michael Stoops, {{executive director of the}} National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington, the curfew is {{the first of its kind}} in the nation. He also said that it effectively amounts to a modern <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1920, Johnson {{was among}} those black leaders of the Republican Party to meet in Chicago to {{establish}} the Lincoln League — an intra-party pressure group designed to force the national Republican Party to take a firm stand against lynching, <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law,</b> voter disfranchisement, and other perceived assaults upon the African-American community. Johnson won promises that the Republican Party would take more determined action on these matters if the White House was won {{in the fall of}} 1920.|$|R
5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws.</b> A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a black fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Montgomery, {{refused to}} give up her bus seat to a white man in {{compliance}} with <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> which were local regulations in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5000|$|After the Dodgers {{announced}} in January that their exhibition games {{would be in}} Macon and Atlanta, Green stated [...] "there is no law against the game. But we have an unwritten law in the South - the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law.</b> [...] " [...] His statements were against the black players on a white team. [...] During the exhibition games, Green using the influence of Herman Talmadge tried to ban Brooklyn Dodgers players, Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910, {{the state}} of Maryland {{established}} the Maryland Public Service Commission and granted it power over common carriers. Similar in nature to the federal Interstate Commerce Commission, [...] "...the primary concern of the Maryland Public Service Commission was rate regulation, but it also had power to hear complaints about service." [...] Shortly after its establishment, William Ashbie Hawkins represented several plaintiffs before the Public Service Commission protesting against the segregated conditions both in boats and trains under the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 6, 1912, President William H. Taft {{announced}} that he would nominate Hook to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court that had been caused by the death of John Marshall Harlan. Opposition was raised, however, by leaders of the NAACP, the Washington Bee, and other African-American newspapers and organizations. Concerned parties discussed Hook's decision in upholding the constitutionality of an Oklahoma <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law</b> discriminating against African American passengers on trains crossing the state line between Kansas and Oklahoma. [...] Mahlon Pitney was selected by the President in place of Hook.|$|R
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters were African American, and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|Racism was {{the main}} target of DuBois's polemics, and he {{strongly}} protested against lynching, <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> and discrimination in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} his {{coaching}} career, Gaines struggled to recruit student players. The end of the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> Era <b>laws</b> led to college basketball becoming fully integrated at all levels. This made it difficult to lure star talent to WSSU.|$|R
50|$|The Fifth Oklahoma Legislature was {{a meeting}} of the {{legislative}} branch of the government of Oklahoma, composed of the Oklahoma Senate and the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The state legislature met in Oklahoma City, in regular session from January 5 to March 23, 1915, and in special session from January 17 to February 22, 1916, during {{the first two years of}} the term of Governor Robert L. Williams. The legislature included six Socialists, who only served for a single term. The only bill sponsored by a Socialist that became Oklahoma law involved hunting. The 1916 special session was called after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Oklahoma's <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The flag {{changes in}} Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida {{coincided with the}} passage of formal <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> {{segregation}} <b>laws</b> throughout the South. Four years before Mississippi incorporated a Confederate battle flag into its state flag, its constitutional convention passed pioneering provisions to 'reform' politics by effectively disenfranchising most African Americans.|$|R
5|$|Reconstruction and rioting, {{coupled with}} the {{implementation}} of <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> in Louisiana led most of the Turpeau family to leave the area and become professionals in the north. David DeWitt became a well-known preacher {{and a member of the}} Ohio House of Representatives and his daughter, Leontine T. Kelly born in Washington, D.C. was the first black woman bishop of the United Methodist Church. George remained in Louisiana, living in Lake Charles, which was very near Jennings, the destination of several of Turpeau's future trips from Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{its most}} {{contentious}} Gilded Age {{interpretation of the}} Equal Protection Clause, Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law</b> that required the segregation of blacks and whites on railroads and mandated separate railway cars {{for members of the}} two races. The Court, speaking through Justice Henry B. Brown, ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in civil rights, not equality in social arrangements. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana's railway law amply met that requirement, being based on [...] "the established usages, customs and traditions of the people." [...] Justice Harlan again dissented. [...] "Every one knows," [...] he wrote, ...|$|R
50|$|Campbell was {{an activist}} for civil justice. She defied the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> {{streetcar}} <b>laws</b> when {{she refused to}} relinquish her seat in the section reserved for whites, and {{as president of the}} Negro Education Association she struggled with governmental officials to redress the inequities in the pay scale and other benefits for Negro teachers.|$|R
50|$|Washington {{was from}} the last {{generation}} of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants. They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> discriminatory <b>laws</b> enacted in the post-Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
25|$|The CIO's major {{organizing}} {{drive of}} this era, Operation Dixie, {{aimed at the}} textile workers of the American South, was a complete failure. The CIO was reluctant to confront <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation <b>laws.</b> Although the Steelworkers' Southern outpost in the steel industry remained intact, the CIO and the union movement as a whole remained marginalized in the Deep South and surrounding states.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{struggle}} for memory and meaning of the Civil War and Reconstruction continued. Lynch wrote a book, The Facts of Reconstruction (1913), and several articles criticizing the then-dominant Dunning School of historiography. Dunning and followers, many of whom were prominent in major Southern universities, evaluated Reconstruction largely from the viewpoint of white former slave owners and ex-Confederates; they expressed the discriminatory views of their societies. They routinely downplayed any positive contributions of African Americans during Reconstruction, said they were dominated by white carpetbaggers, and could not manage political power. (This was in keeping with the disfranchisement of blacks throughout the former Confederacy from 1890 to 1910, and the imposition by state legislatures of racial segregation and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law</b> to restore white supremacy.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1910, {{the state}} of Maryland {{established}} the Maryland Public Service Commission and granted it power over common carriers. Similar in nature to the federal Interstate Commerce Commission, [...] "...the primary concern of the Maryland Public Service Commission was rate regulation, but it also had power to hear complaints about service." [...] Shortly after its establishment, W. Ashbie Hawkins represented several plaintiffs before the Public Service Commission protesting against the segregated conditions both in boats and trains under the <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>law.</b> In October 1911, Hawkins, outraged at poor sleeping and eating conditions for blacks on Chesapeake Bay ferryboats, took the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway Company to court. Though his complaint was dismissed, the Public Service Commission did recommend, on February 13, 1912, that the company upgrade its facilities for blacks.|$|R
5|$|Massaquoi arrived {{that same}} year in the United States and {{experienced}} the racial segregation and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws</b> of the Southern States. She first attended Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, graduating in sociology. Two years later she moved to Fisk University in Nashville earning two master's degrees, first in sociology and then in anthropology in 1944. She assisted her professor, Mark Hanna Watkins, in {{his understanding of the}} Vai language, cooperating with him in compiling a Vai dictionary. She agreed to accept a fellowship as a linguistic advisor, after her father died in 1938. She taught French and German at Fisk and also paid her way by giving instruction in African and European folk dancing, as well as teaching the violin, thanks to her own competence on the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Relying {{on money}} donated by neighbors, Du Bois {{attended}} Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's {{first experience with}} Southern racism, {{which at the time}} encompassed <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, cum laude, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> <b>laws,</b> when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E
50|$|Huston-Tillotson University's {{campus is}} located {{at the site of the}} former Tillotson College on a land feature {{formerly}} known to local residents as Bluebonnet Hill. The 24 acre campus is located in East Austin, between 7th and 11th streets near I-35 and downtown Austin. East Austin has historically been the city's designated place for African-American culture and empowerment largely due to <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation <b>laws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> Era {{segregation}} <b>laws</b> and {{the suggestions}} {{of a family}} friend led him to attend Morgan State University (then Morgan State College), a historically black college in Baltimore, Maryland. [...] He entered {{in the fall of}} 1941 on a football scholarship.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Fayetteville whites adopted <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> and state <b>laws</b> to impose racial segregation. Despite their {{constitutional}} rights, blacks were disenfranchised under a new state constitution, a condition that persisted for more than sixty years, until federal civil rights legislation of the mid-1960s.|$|R
