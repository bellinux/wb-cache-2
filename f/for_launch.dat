5|$|Following the {{completion}} of its construction, CryoSat-2 was placed into storage to await launch. In January 2010, the spacecraft was removed from storage, and shipped to Baikonur <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b> It departed Munich Franz Josef Strauss Airport aboard an Antonov An-124 aircraft on 12 January, and arrived at Baikonur the next day. Following arrival at the launch site, final assembly and testing were conducted.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2001, NASA chose Lockheed Martin as {{the primary}} {{contractor}} for the spacecraft's fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission's instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during MRO's construction, and the spacecraft was moved to John F. Kennedy Space Center on May 1, 2005 to prepare it <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rockets are {{assembled}} at the Horizontal Integration Facility <b>for</b> <b>launches</b> from SLC-37B at Cape Canaveral, and in {{a similar}} facility <b>for</b> <b>launches</b> from SLC-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base.|$|R

50|$|Other options <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> TRS were Titan III or Atlas Agena. Some launch options {{might have}} {{required}} two launches. Martin Marietta proposed the Titan III <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> TRS. The Titan IIIC could carry 29, 600 lbs to low Earth orbit.|$|R
5|$|One of two {{missions}} {{considered for}} the 2003 Mars launch window, the MRO proposal lost against {{what became known as}} the Mars Exploration Rovers. The orbiter mission was rescheduled <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> in 2005, and NASA announced its final name, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, on October 26, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The probe was {{originally}} scheduled <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> on December 30, 2004, but NASA officials delayed its launch, {{in order to}} allow more time for testing the software. It was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on January 12, 2005 at 1:47pm EST (1847 UTC) by a Delta 2 rocket.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{games were}} {{announced}} <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> day in North and South America, with another twelve announced for release later in 2006.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable <b>for</b> <b>launch,</b> but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b> Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload fairing, to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the launch pad on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the launch pad, Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Army {{had retreated}} from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. They {{spent the summer}} of 1776 fortifying those forts, and {{building}} additional ships to augment the small American fleet already on the lake. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake. The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake. By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b>|$|E

5|$|The angled flight decks of the {{carriers}} use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and arrestor wires <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this {{allows for a}} much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board. After the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat, the air wings' strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets and F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{facilities}} at Woomera were demolished {{within a year}} of the final flight, and half of the engineers who had worked on the programme were laid off. The X-4 satellite, which had been manifested <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> by Black Arrow R4, was eventually launched on 9 March 1974, by an American Scout D-1 rocket flying from Space Launch Complex 5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the {{beginning}} of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also {{marked the beginning}} of Mir's second expansion. The Kvant-2 and Kristall modules were now ready <b>for</b> <b>launch.</b> Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of Kvant-2, the first of the 20tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme.|$|E

5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it <b>for</b> <b>launch,</b> a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready <b>for</b> <b>launch</b> was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
