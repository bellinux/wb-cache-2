5|$|By May 2015, {{the games}} were under a {{particularly}} <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.|$|E
25|$|As in <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud,</b> weapons {{wear out}} over time, {{and it is}} {{necessary}} to repair them in order to avoid them breaking and becoming unusable. However, unlike in <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud,</b> when a weapon is broken it does not disappear from the players' inventory. Instead it becomes unusable until repaired, and some of the ABS it has accrued are lost. Also carried over from <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> is that characters themselves can only grow stronger with the consumption of particular items, which can increase their health points and defense.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> was {{the first}} game from {{developer}} Level-5, led by president and CEO Akihiro Hino, who also wrote, produced and designed the game. Development began immediately when the company was founded in October 1998 with a projected development time of two years. When the PlayStation 2 was announced on March 2, 1999, Sony president and CEO Ken Kutaragi used an early demo of <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> to show {{the capabilities of the}} platform. The demo showed a magic carpet flying through a valley, and some waterfall effects.|$|E

40|$|The 1 (0) - 0 (1) {{transition}} of SO at 30 GHz {{has been observed}} in several sources, including the first detection of sulfur monoxide in cold <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> without apparent internal energy sources.

Column densities estimated from a comparison of the results for the two isotopic species indicate a high fractional abundance of SO in <b>dark</b> <b>clouds...</b>|$|R

25|$|The game {{initially}} sold quite poorly. During {{its debut}} week in Japan, it entered the charts at number 15, selling only 19,615 units.

25|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews by critics, who praised its blend of gameplay types, although some did criticize its combat as repetitive.

In December 2015, the game was made available via emulation for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{fire damage}} to {{infrastructure}} and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, {{large parts of}} the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools – Canberra College, Ginninderra College, Erindale College, and Narrabundah College.

25|$|Will {{returns to}} The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals {{the first sign}} within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure {{to help him get}} the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his {{affections}} for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for immortal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil <b>dark</b> <b>cloud.</b> As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.|$|E
500|$|Marceline and {{the group}} prepare for their final {{confrontation}} with the Vampire King. However, they are surprised when he appears before them and openly declares {{that he no longer}} wishes to be a vampire. Marceline believes this to be a ruse, and she attacks him. Maintaining that his will is good, he refuses to engage, and so the group reluctantly agrees to remove the King's vampiric essence. Bubblegum places the Vampire King in the same contraption that she used on Marceline, which causes him to turn into a relatively harmless lion. The vampiric essence, on the other hand, is placed into a bucket. Bubblegum tasks Peppermint Butler with properly disposing of the essence, but he accidentally trips, which causes the most heinous fluid to detonate and form into a new monstrosity: The <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud.</b> [...] This looming essence begins ambling towards the Candy Kingdom, causing Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum to go on the offensive. Marceline, however, loses the will to fight, and she openly laments the futility of resistance. But when she is at her emotional nadir, the Ice King arrives. He briefly talks to Marceline and instills in her a sense of purpose; at the moment, she realizes that it is her destiny to stop the <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud.</b> At the same time, the Candy Kingdom's ruler, King of Ooo (voiced by Andy Daly) is overthrown by his citizens, who then head out to defend their kingdom from the <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud.</b> Other Kingdoms across Ooo, such as Flame Princess's Fire Kingdom, also join the campaign; however, their efforts are not enough to defeat the Cloud. When all seems lost, Marceline finally arrives and uses her demonic soul-sucking abilities to drain the Dark Cloud's from the inside out. However, she does so at the cost of once more becoming the Vampire Queen. Once the incident is over, Marceline comes to terms with her vampiric nature, telling Bubblegum that her time as a mortal has made her more mature. The miniseries concludes with Marceline singing a rendition of [...] "Everything Stays"; as she sings, the audience is presented with short sequences of Ooo returning to normalcy.|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} years, a <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> as been cast over {{the legitimacy of}} the comeback and World Series title due to allegations, as well as positive PED tests, of several players on the 2004 postseason roster, most notably Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz, (who were ALCS and World series MVP's, respectively). Curt Schilling, one of Boston's starting pitchers that year, has vocally suggested that due to rancid use of substances in the Red Sox clubhouse the 2004 title is [...] "tainted" [...] and that his Boston teammates urged him to use PED's on several occasions.|$|E
