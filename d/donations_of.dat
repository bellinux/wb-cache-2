5|$|The {{enthusiasm for}} relics continued, and foundations' {{prestige}} was greatly increased by success in obtaining {{the remains of}} important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining their status after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post-Conquest establishments.|$|E

5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of {{currency notes}} was made from money through corrupt means and not from <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E
5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups.

The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E

A subscription for rebuilding was set and <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster.

5|$|In 2012 {{the museum}} was headed by Sujatmiko. That year David Kristian Budhiyanto of Petra Christian University wrote that {{the museum was}} rarely visited and in some places poorly maintained. He posited this {{to be based on}} a popular view of museums as unexciting or boring places. In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, showing some of its collection in cities such as Yogyakarta and Magelang. Between January and September 2013 the museum received 26,249 visitors, an increase of 250 per cent over the previous year's target; this was credited to the various promotional efforts undertaken. The museum is now promoted as a site for educational tourism and accepts <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> materials related to the press in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In Bakuriani, {{the street}} where Kumaritashvili's {{childhood}} home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who {{won the gold medal}} in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, one of which he gave to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E

5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
5|$|The army sent about 800soldiers to Toronto {{to assist}} with the cleanup, {{providing}} blankets and mattresses. Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the Salvation Army received so many <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> clothes, footwear, blankets, food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed. A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope Pius XII, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company. A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.|$|E

The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon.
