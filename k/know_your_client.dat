To protect investors, the Canadian Government has enacted the "Know Your Client" Act requiring that all investment dealers and vendors of securities must know their clients and advise them on the appropriate investment strategy. This paper uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in a novel manner by applying it to a large data set of answers {{to a number of}} psychological questions. A Slacks Based Model was used to estimate investor risk tolerance. The model analyses the risk profile of the investor and {{can be used as a}} guide to match the risk rating of the investment vehicles for the client. Statistical comparisons were also carried out to show how risk tolerance relates to various demographic variables. Finally, the DEA results were validated through comparisons with the commercial system already in use.

40|$|Money {{laundering}} {{is generally}} regarded as the practice of engaging in financial transactions to conceal the identity, source, and/or destination of illegally gained money by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which {{appear to have a}} legitimate origin. In other words, Money Laundering refers to the conversion or "Laundering " of money which is illegally obtained, so as to make it appear to originate from a legitimate source. The recent activity in money laundering in India is through political parties ‘ corporate companies and share market. Bank fraud is a serious financial crime that involves the unlawful obtainment of funds from a bank or other financial institution. Money is the root cause of many evils like corruption, black marketing, smuggling, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and the buck does not stop here. While carrying out the <b>Know</b> <b>your</b> <b>Client</b> (KYC) norms, special care has to be exercised to ensure that the contracts are not anonymous or under fictitious names. Money is the prime reason for engaging in almost any type of criminal activity. Money laundering is the method by which criminals disguise the illegal origins of their wealth...|$|E

The phenomenological method of holding back junk {{to get to the}} phenomenon does not so much tell us what to do, but what not to do. The suffering of clients can bring “secondary trauma ” to therapists, especially to those with compassion and commitment. They suffer that they can neither take away suffering, suffering their clients do not deserve, nor abandon them. They cannot empathize by suffering their clients ’ suffering. They suffer the impotence of being unable to get out of themselves, out of being who they are {{in the face of the}} otherness of the other commanding relief.

40|$|Background. Transitions in {{care are}} one of the most {{important}} and challenging client safety issues in healthcare. This project was undertaken to gain insight into the practice setting realities for nurses and other health care providers as they manage increasingly complex care transitions across multiple settings. Methods. The Appreciative Inquiry approach was used to guide interviews with sixty-six healthcare providers from a variety of practice settings. Data was collected on participants’ experience of exceptional care transitions and opportunities for improving care transitions. Results. Nurses and other healthcare providers need to know three things to ensure safe care transitions: (1) <b>know</b> <b>your</b> client; (2) <b>know</b> <b>your</b> team on both sides of the transfer; and (3) <b>know</b> the resources <b>your</b> <b>client</b> needs and how to get them. Three themes describe successful care transitions, including flexible structures; independence and teamwork; and client and provider focus. Conclusion. Nurses often operate at the margins of acceptable performance, and flexibility with regulation and standards is often required in complex sociotechnical work like care transitions. Priority needs to be given to creating conditions where nurses and other healthcare providers are free to creatively engage and respond in ways that will optimize safe care transitions...|$|R
40|$|Libraries are {{increasingly}} vocal {{about the need}} to adopt strategic marketing management which is the process of creating and facilitating the exchange of products of value with others. However, the largest proportion of library and information science literature on marketing deals promotion and public relations which is {{only a small part of}} the marketing mix. There seems to have been a fragmented application of marketing principles in the management and operation of libraries because they have lacked strategies to translate the marketing management into their functional management. The concept of market orientation provides a framework for applying marketing principles into library management and operations. Market orientation means the customer is the focal point of all organisational goals and integrates structure, management and operations. Four elements under pin market orientation:  Client orientation – satisfy customer wants and needs  Continuous market research – <b>know</b> <b>your</b> <b>client</b> and their wants and behaviours  Integrate all activities and systems –from management to front line staff everyone share information and same client focus  Client relationship management – a repeat customer is an advertisement for others and sustains your business position In a market oriented organisation, marketing isn’t pushed off to one side as promotion or public relations. Marketing orientation is an organisational management style. Using the 7 P’s of service marketing (product, place, price, processes, people and promotion) this paper examines how QUT Library has translated strategic market management into applied management strategies by cultivating a market orientation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} and appraise within the Ghanaian environment the level of regulations in combat of money laundering and terrorism financing, {{the extent of the}} regulation and the effectiveness of the regulations or laws. Method: Research methodology will be based on qualitative data collection and analysis approach which will consider the gathering of information personally by the researcher including interviews based on structured or semi-structures questions to potential respondents Theory: The theory considered various concepts of money laundering that exist. The chosen concepts identified the various typologies of the money laundering, the negative effects and the regulations adopted in the fight against money laundering in the light of internationally accepted standards. Analysis: The analysis was modeled around four set of issue as a means of evaluating the money laundering regulations in Ghana. They include extent of nation’s vulnerability to Money Laundering; existing Laws or Regulations; the Conformity of Laws or regulations to international standards and an overview of the new anti-money laundering law. Conclusion: Research and analysis revealed that the nation is susceptible to money laundering though it has existing regulations to combat the menace. The forms of money laundering are many {{and there seems to be}} very little public knowledge about money laundering. Financial sector of the economy is expanding and there is a need for a more rigorous means for the combat of laundering as its effect on the sector could be disastrous. The New Anti – Money Laundering law, Anti – Money Laundering Act 2008, Act 749 is timely but it has not been operational, the Financial Intelligence Center is yet to be set up since the enactment of the act in January in 2008; as at the time of writing this conclusion there is a new government in power and this government is yet to constitute a full cabinet of ministers or substantive ministers of state hence it is quite impossible to estimate when the Financial Intelligence Centre; according to France (BoG) during my interview with her, she mentioned that the Center is to be formed under the supervision of Ministry of Finance. Not withstanding, the yet to be formed Center, there has been some exiting laws or regulations from Bank of Ghana for the financial institutions in combat of money laundering and terrorism financing. 83 % respondents agreed that there are existing regulations and Laws but only one respondent representing 17 % indicted that those laws can best be cosmetic. The forms of existing regulations identified are as follows: The (KYC) <b>Know</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Client</b> or Know Your Customer Policy; (PEP) Politically Exposed Persons Policy; (CDD) Customer Due Diligence; (EDD) Enhanced Due Diligence and also regulations for banks to adopted a policy of setting threshold for which any cash or cheque deposit into an account should register to an investigate unit of the bank, such that any amount above the threshold raises an alarm for further investigation and so is any huge withdrawal request. In evaluating the existing regulations, two main assessment points were use as yardstick. They are conformity to international standards and effectiveness of the laws or regulations. Ghana is a member of the Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing in West Africa (GIABA) which has formulated some for steps member countries to follow in their design of their internal policies in combat of Money Laundering. These steps are based on the 40 recommendation and the 9 special recommendations. Clearly it is noted that the few regulations or directives from Bank of Ghana conform to the FATF recommendations. For example • The (KYC) Know Your Customer directive, (CDD) Customer Due Diligence directive and (EDD) Enhanced Due Diligence directive that Bank of Ghana issued to the banks conform with Recommendations 4 to 12 of FATF. • The (PEP) Politically Exposed Persons directive which enables the banks deal with political figures of other countries is an international co-operation and a need for mutual legal assistance, these two conforms with the FAFT Recommendation 35 and FAFT recommendations 36 to 39 and again of FATF Recommendation 40. • The policies on threshold level also conforms to FAFT recommendations 17 to 21 as depicted in the literature review. From the examples given above there are clear indications that the regulations conform to international standards. The effectiveness of the regulation was set to detail or show how wide enough the regulation is in tackling the menace a stake, it should equally involve the institutions that will regulate, implement and enforce the regulations and finally the regulations should be enforced or to be seen a such. However the general picture is that the Laws or Regulations prior to the new Act 749 hasn’t been too effective. The respondents who agreed that there are existing laws or regulations once again agreed there are some lax in the enforcement of the regulations. Roi (SFO) believes that if there is any regulation at all, they can only be said to be just cosmetic. ftontoh@yahoo. com; + 233244284956;+ 23324421290...|$|E

40|$|The {{basic idea}} of federal {{preemption}} is easily stated: It is a constitutionally mandated principle that demands that federal law trumps state law {{when the two}} conflict or in the rare instances when a federal law is so comprehensive that there’s no role left for state law to fill. But in practice, courts have often had difficulty applying the principle. For plaintiff lawyers, preemption is an ever-present worry. When <b>your</b> <b>client</b> has been injured by a defective car, truck, medical device, boat, tobacco product, pesticide, or mislabeled drug, or has been victimized by a bank or other lending institution, the defendant will probably assert that federal law preempts <b>your</b> <b>client’s</b> state law damages claim. You can expect this argument no matter how weak the federal regulatory scheme or how attenuated the connection between that scheme and the harms <b>your</b> <b>client</b> suffered or the state law duties under which <b>your</b> <b>client</b> seeks a remedy. But defendants’ and tort “reformers’” pro-preemption arguments do not reflect current preemption doctrine as established by the courts. A common—and false—argument for preemption, for example, is that state tort law necessarily interferes with federal regulatory objectives. Moreover, preemption of state tort law is a bad idea. Immunizing the makers of products that cause injury simply because, for instance, these products have been approved for marketing by a federal agency harms both the injured people and society generally...|$|R
