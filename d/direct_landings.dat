50|$|The ANR {{provides}} an ongoing capability to detect, validate, and warn of any aircraft and/or cruise missile threat in its {{area of operations}} that could threaten North American security. By maintaining surveillance of Northwest Canadian and U.S. airspace, ANR is able to determine {{what goes on in}} and near North American airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Aerospace control requires capabilities to intercept, shadow, escort, divert, <b>direct</b> <b>landings,</b> and if necessary, use force utilizing interceptors and other means up to and including the destruction of airborne objects.|$|E

50|$|From June 1944 {{he worked}} on Talk Between Ships (TBS). On the day before D-Day, he had worked on HMS Bulolo, which had <b>directed</b> the <b>landings</b> off Gold Beach.|$|R
50|$|HMS Bulolo was a 6,267 ton {{passenger}} {{and cargo}} ship of the Burns, Philp Shipping Company {{operating in the}} South Pacific. In 1939 she was converted into an Armed Merchant Cruiser, then a Landing Ship Headquarters (LSH) in 1942. She <b>directed</b> the <b>landings</b> on North Africa, Sicily, Anzio and Normandy during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Virot and {{her team}} soon {{expanded}} their work to Normandy. In Normandy, the team would <b>direct</b> plane <b>landings</b> and exchange information via the plane crew. In one of these exchanges, Virot received a personal letter of thanks from Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The letter read: [...] "This last mission {{is the equivalent of}} a victory on the battlefield!" [...] Unfortunately, for security purposes, the letter had to be destroyed immediately.|$|R

Shortly afterwards the Bayfield was sent to Naples for the {{invasion of}} Southern France. However, on August 5, 1944, Moon shot himself with his [...]45 caliber pistol. His suicide was blamed on battle fatigue.|$|R

On 15 June she reached Saipan and <b>directed</b> initial <b>landings</b> which came under heavy mortar and rifle fire and air attack. After 24 days, organized resistance {{on the island}} ceased. Rocky Mount proceeded to Guam 20 July, and 4 days later sailed for Tinian.|$|R
25|$|Rear Admiral Theodore Wilkinson, Commander Third Fleet Amphibious Forces, was {{assigned}} by Halsey to <b>direct</b> the <b>landings</b> at Cape Torokina from aboard his flagship, the attack transport George Clymer. The ships under Wilkinson's command would disembark the I Marine Amphibious Corps {{under the command}} of Major General Alexander Vandegrift, victor of the land campaign on Guadalcanal. Vandegrift's force, a total of 14,321 men, consisted of the 3rd Marine Division (reinforced), under Maj. Gen. Allen H. Turnage, the 37th Infantry Division (Army), under Maj. Gen. Robert S. Beightler, and the Advance Naval Base Unit No. 7.|$|R

50|$|The {{knowledge}} he {{had gained}} at Lochaber was to prove invaluable as the Second World War approached and the transport authorities sought {{to protect the}} London Underground system from flooding. He also helped design deep air raid shelters, eight of which were attached to existing stations such as Goodge Street tube station (which also housed a signals centre used by General Eisenhower to <b>direct</b> the D-Day <b>landings</b> in Normandy in 1944).|$|R
40|$|The feeding habits, energy intake, and prey {{preferences}} of Homarus americanus {{were examined in}} the laboratory. Preference was determined by placing various animals in tanks with lobsters. This confirmed that sea urchins, crabs, mussels and periwinkles are readily eaten by lobsters. Feeding was observed at night using an infrared light and the feeding actions were described. The caloric intake of four lobsters maintained for one year, two at 15 ﾟC, were measured. It varied directly with fluctuations in the water temperature. It was learned that a sea urchins ability to grip its substrate depends directly on the sea water temperature. Thus as lobster food they are more easily acquired during the colder winter months. [...] A distribution study considered both food and bottom type. It indicated a <b>direct</b> correlation between <b>landings</b> and distribution of lobsters; and between lobsters, bottom type and food...|$|R
5000|$|The gun-armed [...] "amtank" [...] LVT(A)-1 and LVT(A)-4 were {{developed}} to provide fire support. Armed with a 75mm howitzer, the latter was introduced in 1944 just before the Marianas campaign, and was especially effective in this role as it was capable of destroying Japanese fortifications as it came ashore. Its howitzer complemented the 75mm gun of the Sherman tanks used by the Marines. However the LVT(A)-4 had an open-topped turret which left the crew vulnerable to artillery and infantry attack, especially to the latter, as it lacked any sort of machine gun armament. The lack of machine gun armament was eventually rectified, though the open-topped turret remained {{in order to save}} weight. Although usually used in a <b>direct</b> role during <b>landings</b> only (once inland the [...] "amtanks" [...] were assigned to artillery formations to augment their firepower), in the Marianas campaign [...] "amtanks" [...] were employed inland, much like regular tanks.|$|R
50|$|An {{integrated}} military {{structure for}} NATO was first established after the Korean War raised questions over {{the strength of}} Europe's defences against a Soviet attack. The first choice for commander in Europe was American General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, as he had successfully <b>directed</b> the Allied <b>landings</b> in Normandy and subsequent march into Germany during World War II, amid many inter-Allied controversies over the proper conduct of the campaign on the Western Front. On December 19, 1950, the North Atlantic Council announced the appointment of General Eisenhower as the first SACEUR. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard L. Montgomery moved over from the predecessor Western Union Defence Organization (WUDO) {{to become the first}} Deputy SACEUR, who would serve until 1958. Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's Life of Montgomery of Alamein gives a good account of Montgomery's exacting, tireless approach to improving the command's readiness, which caused a good deal of bruised feelings in doing so. In establishing the command, the first NATO planners drew extensively on WUDO plans and personnel.|$|R
5000|$|An article {{entitled}} “Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax” appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup [...] "alt.humor.best-of-usenet". One passage - on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy - reads:NASA further leveraged their position {{by threatening to}} publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This {{would have been an}} intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of Dr. Strangelove.Kubrick had no such brother - the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk [...] "on location" [...] on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word, whereas Jay Weidner gave the brother a more senior status within the party:No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to <b>direct</b> the Apollo <b>landings.</b> Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, {{was the head of the}} American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.|$|R
40|$|Research {{paper and}} presentationAlong the {{southern}} Sicilian coast (Central Mediterranean Sea), Sciacca harbor {{is the most}} important landing port for small pelagic fish species (manly anchovies and sardines) [1, 2]. This landing side accounts for about 2 / 3 of total catch in GFCM-FAO Geographical Sub-Area 16 (South of Sicily), where two operational units (OU) are presently active: purse seiners and pelagic pair trawlers [3]. The GSA 16 fleet is composed from 46 units (31 purse seiners and 15 pelagic pair trawlers; Community Fishing Fleet Register, [URL] In both OUs, anchovy represents the main target species due to the higher market price. Although small pelagic fishes are locally quite appreciated for <b>direct</b> fresh consumption, <b>landings</b> are always totally absorbed by Sciacca transformation (canning) companies’ high demand. Consequently, local consumption of fresh fish is relatively low, also because small pelagic fish are considered “poor” when compared to the wide fish variety in Sciacca market. This study analyzes the links between anchovy landings by pelagic pair trawlers and their market price from daily catch/price data collected in Sciacca harbor throughout the period March 1999 - December 2013...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary Major {{findings}} for TOR 1 – Characterize the commercial catch including landings, effort and discards by gear type. Describe {{the magnitude of}} uncertainty in these sources of data. Landings were largest in the 1970 s, when catch was dominated by foreign fleets targeting longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) in offshore areas. Foreign landings were completely phased out by 1987. Landings during 1988 - 2001 averaged 2, 797 mt (6. 2 million lb). From 2002 - 2012 there was no <b>directed</b> fishery, and <b>landings,</b> primarily as bycatch in the small mesh (< 4 in = 10. 2 cm) bottom trawl longfin squid fishery, have been below 900 mt (2. 0 million lb). A directed fishery was re-established in January 2013, and preliminary landings have been 1, 070 mt (2. 4 million lb) to date. Discards were estimated for the period 1989 - 2012 using the Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology (Wigley et al., 2007). Discards comprised {{a majority of the}} total butterfish catch, averaging 58 % during 1989 - 2001 and 67 % during 2002 - 2012. Total catch estimates were highly variable and imprecise, with CVs ranging from 0. 07 – 1. 43 due to the uncertain discard estimates. Recreational catches were negligible...|$|R
40|$|Two {{sources of}} {{historical}} landing data from California's commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet were examined to: 1) assess status {{and content of}} each archival data source, 2) identify reporting differences, and 3) evaluate potential usefulness of the data for enhancing resource assessment. Current and historical CPFV logbook data collected by California Department of Fish and Game are described with respect to status, content, and approximate cost of recovering historical data (1936 - 78) to electronic format. CPFV landing data available from Los Angeles Times, archived in libraries since 1959, are similarly described. CPFV logbook data were compared with observer data from 1985 - 89 to evaluate accuracy of logbook records. Comparison of catch and effort for major species targeted by southern California CPFV anglers revealed significant relationships between reported and observed catch rates for six of ten species examined. Agreement of catch rate trends validates use of logbook data for measuring relative changes in catch and effort for these sport fish species. <b>Direct</b> comparisons of <b>landings</b> data from CPFV logs and Los Angeles Times fish reports were made for years in which Times data are already available in electronic database format, including 1959, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1991, and 1992. Comparisons of total landings by species among years revealed strong correlations between the two sources for those species (e. g., California barracuda, yellowtail, bonito) most heavily targeted over the entire period. Other species, such as California sheephead, spotted scorpionfish, and ocean whitefish, were underreported or not reported by the Times until recently. Comparison of port-wide total landings of all species (1983, 1991, 1992) revealed varied reports of total catch (all species) between sources among ports and years. Times-logbook landing report comparisons were highly correlated for Los Angeles area ports (r 2 = 0. 956), but were also most different in absolute number, with Times reports being an average of 48...|$|R
