50|$|A cam/rocker {{assembly}} uses {{a normal}} cam, but the roller-tip-rocker has a wheel {{on the end}} of it like that of a measuring wheel, which rolls by the use of needle bearings. Others will add roller bearings for the main pivot also. Although roller rockers are used in both pushrod and overhead cam engines, roller rockers for pushrod and overhead cam engines are considerably different in design. For pushrod engines, roller rockers employ a roller where the rocker contacts the valve stem. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>roller</b> rockers for overhead cam engines employ a roller where the rocker contacts the cam. This greatly reduces frictional losses and wear compared to slipper followers (where the cam simply slides on a surface on the rocker arm). The difference between a roller rocker and a standard rocker with slipper followers on an overhead cam engine is analogous to the difference between roller lifters and flat tappet lifters on a pushrod engine.|$|E

To maintain consistency with the conventional structure of harp soundboards (Fig.  1 a), the fiber direction of the veneer was aligned perpendicular to that of the base wood. First, a curing agent was applied (50  g/m 2) {{to the surface of the}} base wood and maintained at 25 °C and 60 % relative humidity (RH) for 1  day to allow the solvent to evaporate. Next, base resin was applied (100  g/m 2) to the surface of the veneer using a <b>hand</b> <b>roller.</b> Finally, the veneer was attached to the base wood and cured at room temperature for 1  h under a pressure of 0.1  MPa.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was the in vivo {{investigation}} of the topical bioavailability of a model glucocorticosteroid, triamcinolone acetonide (TACA), using tape stripping. The layer by layer removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping enables the quantification of drug amounts penetrated into the stratum corneum over time. This dermatopharmacokinetic (DPK) approach has been subject of fervent discussions in the past years, and concern about adequacy and reproducibility of the technique has been expressed. Yet, the successful performance of reliable and reproducible tape stripping investigations highly depends {{on the use of}} a standardized methodology and suitable analytical methods. This thesis proposed a standardized tape stripping protocol in combination with carefully validated analytical methods (Project I). After a proof of concept, the set of methods was applied in an in vivo investigation of the influence of different factors on topical bioavailability. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects ultimately determining the successful therapy outcome were investigated: the effect of dose and application frequency (Project II), the effect of occlusion (Project III), and the efficacy of a low-dose TACA formulation (Project IV). Concomitantly, the corticosteroid accumulation within the stratum corneum (reservoir development) was monitored, since a reservoir can considerably affect the therapy outcome and is particularly advantageous to prevent systemic side effects. In Project I, the tape stripping technique was standardized and an HPLC method for TACA quantification on tapes after extraction was validated. The standardized tape stripping protocol included the use of a template (ensured the removal of stratum corneum samples from the same skin site) and a <b>hand</b> <b>roller</b> (ensured a constant pressure on the tape before stripping), and, most importantly, the removal of the entire stratum corneum of one skin site to cope with inter- and intra-individual differences in stratum corneum thickness. The HPLC method for TACA quantification was successfully validated and proved to have suitable specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in the working range. The combination of 1) standardized tape stripping as sampling method, 2) UV/VIS-spectroscopy for quantification of corneocytes (previously validated), and 3) the new validated HPLC method for quantification of TACA was then applied in a proof of concept with 6 healthy volunteers. TACA was applied on their forearm skin in either an acetonic solution or an ethanolic gel, and stratum corneum samples were removed by tape stripping after 0. 5 h, 3 h, and 24 h. A clear vehicle effect on the TACA penetration could be observed. Whereas TACA deeply penetrated into the stratum corneum after application of the acetonic solution, the penetration after application of the ethanolic gel was only superficial (development of a skin surface reservoir). The method set proved to be suitable for the investigation of the TACA penetration into stratum corneum and was applied in a pharmacokinetic clinical trial with healthy volunteers (Projects II and III). In Project II, the effect of dose and application frequency on the in vivo penetration of TACA into stratum corneum was investigated in 15 healthy volunteers. Dose and application frequency of topical corticosteroids are recurrently debated topics. Multiple-daily applications are common, although a superior efficacy compared to once-daily applications is not unequivocally proven. In the dose experiment, higher TACA amounts were quantified within the stratum corneum after application of a high dose (300 mg/cm 2 vs. 100 mg/cm 2; acetonic solution). However, this difference was only significant immediately after application, and no difference was recorded at 4 h and 24 h. The application frequency experiment showed slightly higher TACA amounts within the stratum corneum after multiple application (3 x 100 mg/cm 2) than after single application of the total dose (1 x 300 mg/cm 2). As a result of multiple applications, the skin was periodically reloaded with new drug, thus achieving temporary higher amounts within the stratum corneum and redissolving potential TACA crystals. The still well quantifiable TACA amount retained within the stratum corneum at 24 h was rather due to the slow diffusion through the stratum corneum barrier than to a classical reservoir formation. The performance of a mass balance showed that a high TACA dose could result in faster stratum corneum permeation and higher systemic exposure, unwelcome in topical therapy. Thus, a low dose applied once daily may be preferable to higher doses. In Project III, the effects of occlusion before (pre-occlusion) and after (post-occlusion) TACA application (100 mg/cm 2; acetonic solution) were investigated on the forearms of 10 healthy volunteers. Occlusion is known to enhance skin hydration and can induce the formation of a stratum corneum reservoir. Moreover, occlusion is clinically used to improve the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in severe forms of skin diseases. Pre-occlusion showed no effect on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum. In contrast, post-occlusion enhanced the TACA penetration by a factor of 2, favoring the development of a 24 h-lasting reservoir. The efficacy of low-dose TACA in the treatment of atopic dermatitis was proved in Project IV, a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized pharmacodynamic explorative study with half-side comparison in 14 patients. Low-dose TACA was added to a marketed skin care cream (Lichtena®) in a concentration which was 40 times lower than typical therapeutical corticosteroid concentrations (25 vs. 1000 μg/g). Twice-daily application of the low-dose TACA formulation reduced the severity of the lesions (assessed by SCORAD) already after 1 week. In contrast, the cream base alone had no significant influence on the severity of atopic dermatitis measured for 1 month. These findings indicate that some corticosteroids may already be effective at much lower concentrations than usually used therapeutically, and that marketed corticosteroid formulations may contain a much higher concentration than necessary. The investigations described in this thesis show how tape stripping, correctly performed, asserts itself as a valuable technique for topical bioavailability assessment. The DPK approach can be applied for the investigation of topical bioavailability of other compounds as well, provided that specific analytical methods for their quantification are developed and validated. Reimplementation of the DPK approach on regulatory level could be considered...|$|E

These results point to eventually increased levels of genetic load as a result of the increased homozygosity in some gene loci causing an increased frequency of some recessive phenotypes in patients with lung diseases.

40|$|Wheat bran, a {{co-product}} of {{the industrial}} roller milling of wheat, {{can be added to}} food products such as bread because of its nutritional profile and physiological effects. However, incorporation of wheat bran in bread systems can negatively affect final product quality. Next to possible taste issues, bran-enriched bread modifies crumb texture and shows a lower loaf volume as compared to white bread. Some intrinsic bran properties are believed to play a considerable role in this quality reduction. These properties can be either physical, chemical or biochemical in nature. However, the actual contribution and relative importance of each of these properties to decreased bread quality is a matter of debate. To counteract the negative effects of bran on bread quality, bran-enriched products can be supplemented with gluten, emulsifiers or other improvers, which are generally relatively expensive. Clear understanding of the relationship between bran composition and structure, bran properties and bran impact on bread making is, however, still missing. Against this background, this dissertation investigates the relationship between intrinsic bran properties and their effect on bread making, and aims to provide insight in the causes of the quality loss upon incorporation of bran in bread. To this end, bran fractions differing in intrinsic properties were produced using either a roller milling or a pearling process, and related to their effect on bread making. Both processes were used to obtain bran fractions with different properties, and were themselves not studied in detail in this dissertation. Next to this, more in-depth research into the impact of the physical presence of wheat bran particles and bran water binding capacity during bran-enriched bread making was executed. In a first experimental part of this thesis, the properties of bran fractions, produced by roller milling or by pearling and their impact on bread making was investigated. With both explorative approaches, a first view was obtained on the relationship between bran constituents, enzyme activity levels, steric hindrance, and hydration properties on the one hand, and bread volume and textural quality on the other <b>hand.</b> Four industrial <b>roller</b> milling fractions - coarse bran, coarse weatings, fine weatings, and low grade flour - were studied. All co-products differed in chemical composition, enzyme activity levels, particle size, and hydration properties. To relate these properties with the effect of co-products on bread making, meals consisting of flour and co-products were composed on a same overall starch level to compensate for differences in endosperm contamination in the co-products. While uncommon, this approach seemed appropriate here, as the co-products differed strongly in botanical bran content. Bread specific volume was more strongly depressed with fine weatings and low grade flour than with coarse bran and coarse weatings. While this suggests that the properties of the former were intrinsically more detrimental to bread volume than those of the latter, it was not clear which properties were responsible for this, as the variability between the different co-products was relatively high. More insight in the contribution of bran properties on bread quality was gained when wheat bran was mechanically treated through abrasive pearling (also referred to as debranning). Pearling is a more specific, bran-directed treatment than roller milling, producing bran fractions with a similar particle size distribution (in contrast to the different milling co-products), but with a broader variation in other properties amongst each other. Pearling fractions P 0 - 3 %, P 3 - 6 %, P 6 - 9 % and P 9 - 12 %, obtained after pearling to 3, 6, 9 and 12 % by weight, strongly differed in composition, hydration properties, enzymatic load, and chemical reactivity. Pericarp-rich fraction P 0 - 3 %, having the highest water binding capacity among the fractions, had the most adverse effects on bread quality, whereas addition of aleurone-rich fraction P 6 - 9 %, having low water binding capacities, had less adverse effects on bread properties. To investigate the contribution of bran-associated enzymes on bread quality loss, a heat treated versus a native P 0 - 3 % fraction, the latter having a high bran-associated enzymatic activity, were compared. The results showed that bran-associated enzymes can clearly affect both the Hagberg Falling Number of meal and bread crumb textural properties. The reducing power of bran-associated chemical components, finally, is probably less determinative as compared to other properties. Overall, results from {{the first part of the}} experimental work suggested that bran hydration is a key element that determines its impact on bread making, but further research was needed in this dissertation to confirm and underpin this. Hence, in a second part of this dissertation, the effect of hydration properties and the steric effect of bran particles on different parts of the bread making process were studied more in-depth. Regular coarse and ground bran, synthetic bran-like particles with no water binding capacity, and pericarp-enriched bran particles were incorporated in a bread recipe, and their effect on bread making was studied. Dough with synthetic bran displayed a near to normal oven rise and resulted in a smaller loaf volume decrease as compared to the breads containing regular and pericarp-enriched bran, strengthening the hypothesis that water binding by bran affects the bread making process the most. Besides, grinding of regular bran and synthetic bran did not change their impact compared to coarse particles, suggesting that steric hindrance by the physical presence of bran particles is of less importance. Finally, the molecular mobility of water and biopolymers in coarse, ground, and pericarp-enriched wheat bran and refined flour was studied using time-domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD 1 H NMR) relaxometry, and related to their hydration properties. These insights were used to assess water mobility and biopolymer behavior during bran-enriched bread making and subsequent storage. Bran incorporation in dough resulted in a progressive immobilization of water during dough resting, which was not observed in the white control dough. This could be linked to changes in evolution of dough height during fermentation and oven rise. This, together with modified starch gelatinization behavior upon baking, seems at least partly responsible for the lower loaf volume and inferior crumb texture properties in bran-rich breads. Textural quality during storage was less affected for bran-rich bread compared to wheat flour bread. The latter could be principally attributed to retardation of amylopectin retrogradation during bread storage in the presence of bran. In conclusion, this dissertation studied the functional relevance and contribution to quality loss of the enzymatic load, chemical reactivity, steric hindrance and water binding capacity of wheat bran in bran-enriched bread making. Bran-associated enzymes did not affect loaf volume when fermentable substrate was abundantly present, but were functionally relevant with regard to Hagberg Falling Number and crumb textural properties. Reducing compounds from bran had limited impact on bread making. The hydration properties of bran are believed to be a key element in the deleterious effect of bran on bread quality. This could be due to modifications in dough rheology during leavening and starch gelatinization behavior during baking, leading to a negligible oven rise when flour is replaced by bran. This effect was independent of the size of bran particles. The knowledge of the actual contribution and functional relevance of bran properties during bread making obtained in this dissertation allows bran-centered approaches to enhance the nutritional value and physiological benefits of bread with mitigated quality loss. status: publishe...|$|R
