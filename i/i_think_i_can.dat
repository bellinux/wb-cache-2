5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Really, Gwendolen, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{allow this}} at all.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. Because she is both. (Piteously.) I'm not clever, dear, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{make myself}} {{understood}} properly.|$|R

25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If you still feel doubtful about the little cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you," [...] said Gertrude, {{plucking}} out {{the scarf}} a little behind. [...] "I {{could do it}} myself, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> explain it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] I said, [...] "what a very {{unpleasant}} arrangement! And whereabouts is {{this extraordinary}} theatre? <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{ever have been}} inside it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's pretty sore still," [...] Reuben replied, [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> walk about much; but I thought I {{might help}} {{in some other}} way." ...|$|R
500|$|Reger {{completed}} the composition on 25August 1915. He {{wrote to the}} publisher [...] on : [...] "I've finished two choral works (Der Einsiedler and Requiem). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely say that they're both among the most beautiful things I've ever written." [...] (Ich habe nun zwei Chorwerke (Der Einsiedler und Requiem) fertig. Ich glaube sagen zu dürfen, daß diese beiden Chorwerke mit das Schönste sind, was ich je geschrieben habe.) Requiem was first published by [...] in 1916, edited by Ulrich Haverkampf, with the dedication Dem Andenken der im Kriege gefallenen deutschen Helden (To {{the memory of the}} German heroes who fell in the War). Simrock also published a vocal score as prepared by Reger himself.|$|E
500|$|Energized by {{the success}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter {{considered}} expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks. She wrote her editor Norman Warne, [...] "I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make something of him". The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's [...] illustrations for Jeremy: [...] "When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist".|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Washington {{teenager}} MacKaye discovered {{punk rock}} through a local college radio station, Georgetown University's WGTB. He met Nelson, a classmate of his, after the latter {{set off a}} pipe bomb outside their school and MacKaye went to investigate. The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind because I saw {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event. [...] I thought, 'This appeals to me. This is the world <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> breathe in. This is what I need'".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Albinia, 'some evening perhaps I may come, since yon are so kind, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{leave this}} poor twisted arm to itself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to, sir, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall. It {{is only when}} I get a sudden shock that I faint, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get one there." ...|$|R
500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals {{convinced}} me it wasn't something I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E
500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's {{going to do a}} great job and I'll just look forward to working with him. I'm still really young in the [...] job as well and very inexperienced at this level, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> learn a lot off him." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
6000|$|At last he said: [...] "You know, I'm simply dead. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> absorb {{anything}} more profitably. Let's go {{and sit down}} on one of the benches." ...|$|R
6000|$|Our young woman's emotion deepened; she flushed {{a little}} and smiled at her aunt in silence. [...] "Do {{everything}} you tell me? <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise that." ...|$|R

500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said to me after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do better." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was really about the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with a knock on his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance if you turn up motivated, fit and organised and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{truth is}} simple," [...] he said earnestly. [...] "We do not know. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> answer for myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> answer for the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{heard of}} it. But {{it has made}} such a {{difference}} between him and me, that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> meddle. Send for Lord Chiltern, and speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> did. <b>Can</b> you not {{understand}} that a man may be in great doubt as to the exact words {{that he may have}} spoken at such a time?' ...|$|R
500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
500|$|Žigić played {{regularly}} {{through the}} 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under {{the management of}} Radomir Antić, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament {{for the first time}} as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that can do it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E

6000|$|... "The request," [...] he said, [...] "is {{a little}} vague, and perhaps, I am a trifle rash, but <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise {{that what you}} ask shall be done." ...|$|R
