5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An example of this <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would {{be taken into account}} in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

25|$|The RBE of {{different}} types of heavy particles on CNS function and cognitive/behavioral performance was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the thresholds for the HZE particle-induced disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 6-4; and for the disruption of operant responding <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 6-5. These figures show a similar pattern of responsiveness to the disruptive effects of exposure to either 56Fe or 28Si particles on both CTA learning and operant responding. These results suggest that the RBE {{of different}} particles for neurobehavioral dysfunction cannot be predicted {{solely on the basis of}} the LET of the specific particle.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{claimed that}} both the {{electrons}} and ion populations have bell curve distribution; that the plasma is thermalized. The justification given is that the longer the electrons and ions move inside the polywell, the more interactions they undergo leading to thermalization.

25|$|Native {{antithrombin}} can {{be converted}} to latent antithrombin (L-antithrombin) by heating alone or heating in the presence of citrate. However, without extreme heating and at 37°C (body temperature) 10% of all antithrombin circulating in the blood is converted to the L-antithrombin over a 24-hour period.

25|$|In {{the unit}} cell, {{there are three}} {{independent}} icosahedra, I1, I2 and I3, and a B10 polyhedron which are formed by the B1–B4, B5–B8, B9–B13 and B14–B17 sites, respectively. The B10 polyhedron has not been observed previously and it <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 23. The icosahedron I2 has a boron-carbon mixed-occupancy site B,C6 whose occupancy is B/C=0.58/0.42. Remaining 3 boron-carbon mixed-occupancy sites are bridge sites; C and Si sites are also bridge sites.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between conventional polymers and plasma polymers is that plasma polymers do not contain regular repeating units. Due {{to the number of}} different propagating species present at any one time as discussed above, the resultant polymer chains are highly branched and are randomly terminated {{with a high degree of}} cross-linking. An example of a proposed structure for plasma polymerized ethylene demonstrating a large extend of cross-linking and branching <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 4.|$|E
25|$|The {{proteins}} {{of these}} channels are named Nav1.1 through Nav1.9. The gene names {{are referred to}} as SCN1A through SCN11A (the SCN6/7A gene is part of the Nax sub-family and has uncertain function). The likely evolutionary relationship between these channels, based on the similarity of their amino acid sequences, <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 1. The individual sodium channels are distinguished not only by differences in their sequence but also by their kinetics and expression profiles. Some of this data is summarized in table 1, below.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{designs for}} {{apparatus}} used in plasma polymerization, {{one of which is}} the Bell (static type), in which monomer gas is put into the reaction chamber, but does not flow through the chamber. It comes in and polymerizes without removal. This type of reactor <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 1. This reactor has internal electrodes, and polymerization commonly takes place on the cathode side. All devices contain the thermostatic bath, which is used to regulate temperature, and a vacuum to regulate pressure.|$|E
25|$|As <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 2, in general, the torpedo {{does not}} {{actually}} {{move in a}} straight path immediately after launch {{and it does not}} instantly accelerate to full speed, which are referred to as torpedo ballistic characteristics. The ballistic characteristics are described by three parameters: reach, turning radius, and corrected torpedo speed. Also, the target bearing angle is different {{from the point of view}} of the periscope versus the point of view of the torpedo, which is referred to as torpedo tube parallax. These factors are a significant complication in the calculation of the gyro angle and the TDC must compensate for their effects.|$|E
25|$|In polymerization, both {{gas phase}} and surface {{reactions}} occur, but mechanism differs {{between high and}} low frequencies. At high frequencies it occurs in reactive intermediates, whereas at low frequencies polymerization happens mainly on surfaces. As polymerization occurs, the pressure inside the chamber decreases in a closed system, since gas phase monomers go to solid polymers. An example diagram of the ways that polymerization can take place <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 2, wherein the most abundant pathway is shown in blue with double arrows, with side pathways shown in black. The ablation occurs by gas formation during polymerization. Polymerization has two pathways, either the plasma state or plasma induced processes, which both lead to deposited polymer.|$|E

25|$|There {{are eight}} atomic {{sites in the}} unit cell: one yttrium Y, four boron B1–B4, one carbon C3 and three silicon sites Si1–Si3. Atomic coordinates, site {{occupancy}} and isotropic displacement factors are listed in table Va; 68% of the Y sites are randomly occupied and remaining Y sites are vacant. All boron sites and Si1 and Si2 sites are fully occupied. The C3 and Si3 sites can be occupied by either carbon or silicon atoms (mixed occupancy) with a probability of about 50%. Their separation is only 0.413 Å, and thus either the C3 or Si3 sites, but not both, are occupied. These sites form Si-C pairs, but not Si-Si or C-C pairs. The distances between the C3 and Si3 sites and the surrounding sites for YxB12C0.33Si3.0 are summarized in table Vb and the overall crystal structure <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 14.|$|E
25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 1. In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.|$|E
25|$|One such feature {{available}} for paleontology, {{shared by all}} living mammals (including monotremes), but not present {{in any of the}} early Triassic therapsids, <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 1: mammals use two bones for hearing that all other amniotes use for eating. The earliest amniotes had a jaw joint composed of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of the}} lower jaw) and the quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). All non-mammalian tetrapods use this system including amphibians, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs (and their descendants the birds), ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. But mammals have a different jaw joint, composed only of the dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (another small skull bone). In the Jurassic, their quadrate and articular bones evolved into the incus and malleus bones in the middle ear. Mammals also have a double occipital condyle; they have two knobs at the base of the skull that fit into the topmost neck vertebra, while other tetrapods have a single occipital condyle.|$|E
