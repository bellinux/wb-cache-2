500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> so happy to see him and I think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," [...] and that Grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble.|$|E

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly understands that the horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lead singer Richard Ashcroft {{wrote the}} song in early 1995. He briefly {{mentioned}} it {{in an interview at}} the time, relating it to his drug usage: [...] "There's a new track I've just written ... It goes 'the drugs don't work, they <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> worse, and I know I'll see your face again'. That's how I'm feeling at the moment. They <b>make</b> <b>me</b> worse, man. But I still take 'em. Out of boredom and frustration you turn to something else to escape." ...|$|R

When they were having their clothes designed (by Richard Tyler), Garth said: [...] "If you're going to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> anything <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> something like this," [...] showing him the satin bomber jacket. [...] Before they knew what was happening, the trend took hold and everybody in the band was having them made up to their own requirements. Their management then {{went as far as}} using it as a marketing tool for the band.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> think of a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. I {{have no problem with}} that, but it's just not really how I pictured being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn's second child, Betty Jessop, turned {{eighteen}} in 2007 {{and returned}} to the FLDS. As was acknowledged by both parties, Carolyn had to physically force her to leave the FLDS when she was thirteen. Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard every morning, I was an emotional wreck, and after a while, I hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much. I just couldn't deny what was in my heart -- my belief in my religion and my love for my father and my family. I spent four years , and there is nothing there for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, because it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways. But {{at the end of}} the day, I think Ghost gonna have to really say what he gotta say." [...] However, in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music, Ghost responded with [...] "...'Perb [...] is Rae’s [...] man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit. He ain’t write shit. All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air. When we write, we all do that. [...] "Say this one right here" [...] or [...] "Put this one right here." [...] We all catch lines with each other ‘cause you in the studio. You got niggas around you that write. Even if he did write a verse, he could never make an album of mine. He couldn’t make an album, you feel me? I made Supreme Clientele what it is. Those are my stories, based around whatever they’re based upon. It’s me. I can’t see what songs ‘Perb wrote.

As {{a teacher at the}} Mark Twain Writer's Workshop, he once read from a stack of rejection letters, which he claimed papered the walls of his writing study.
