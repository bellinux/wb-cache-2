500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E
500|$|Phipps {{had little}} {{tolerance}} for foolishness and retained a professional soldier's dislike of civilian interference in military affairs, and ineffective administration, whether from civilians or government. In 1887, {{shortly after his}} retirement, {{he wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Times addressing some of the highly publicized problems of desertions from the ranks. [...] "War Office civilians," [...] he wrote, [...] "like the plan of indiscriminate enlist, as it swells their list of recruits. [...] Then, when the list of deserters grows, they put on long faces, and say, 'it must be those wicked officers.' [...] The officers would stop this plan in a day if they were allowed." [...] The problem with recruiters, Phipps maintained, lay in the need for quantity, not quality. [...] "What fools you civilians are to pay for these blackguards," [...] he wrote. [...] "If you would let the officers select their men, for the first year or so, you would have fewer men on paper, fewer men in prison, and just as many men for service....I will then <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> hint for saving money...why not do away with the Inspector-General of Recruiting, and spend his pay in horse artillery, who would be very ornamental and very serviceable? What use is the Inspector General?" [...] He had retired from active service in 1883, and Phipps fully retired in 1887, after attaining the rank of colonel.|$|E
2500|$|The Holy Ghost is {{regarded}} as [...] "a being endowed with the attributes and powers of Deity and not a mere force or essence." [...] He testifies of the Father and the Son. [...] "By {{the power of the}} Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." [...] The Holy Ghost can sanctify people enabling them [...] "to put off the natural man and [...] a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord". [...] The Holy Ghost is the comforter that Jesus promised to send: [...] "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> Comforter, that he may abide with you forever." ...|$|E

6000|$|From gay {{he turned}} to grave. [...] "I ought to have thought. I haven't been fair; I haven't played the game. I ought to have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> chance; and I haven't, have I?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Like Water for Chocolate {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Rolling Stones Kris Ex called Common [...] "a hip-hop MC willing to actually examine himself through his art". NMEs Stevie Chick {{described him as}} a [...] "great storyteller" [...] who is [...] "equal parts philosopher and documentarian." [...] Spins Peter S. Scholtes praised Like Water for Chocolate as [...] "his most aggressive and powerful record yet", and The Wire also hailed it as his best album. The Source wrote that the album finds [...] "a more worldly Common... creating full-fledged jazz, funk and soul songs". Mojo called Like Water for Chocolate the [...] "most user-friendly contribution so far to the wave of 'conscious' rap." [...] RapReviews critic Steve Juon wrote: [...] "From 'Payback is a Grandmother' {{all the way to}} the finale 'Pop's Rap III' you'll find your ears have been smothered in a sweet darkness that Dove has never been able to wrap in foil and sell for ninety-nine cents. You may in fact be coming down off a hip-hop sugar high. Not to worry – just hit random play and any track on this album will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> fix." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people. [...] " ...|$|E

60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [laughing and caressing his arm]. We were frightfully in {{love with}} one another, Hector.

6000|$|... 'I really cannot see that,' {{said his}} friend. 'You have {{experienced}} this morning a disappointment, {{but not a}} calamity. If you had lost your eye {{it would have been}} a calamity: no combination of circumstances could have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>another.</b> There are really no miseries except natural miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions. What seems conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.' ...|$|R

It was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding.

5000|$|After getting {{approval}} from the Dahl estate, Tim McDonald and Leslie Bricusse worked together on the play. McDonald said [...] "Our challenge {{was to create a}} live theatrical musical event that satisfied your expectations of the book and the film - but hopefully <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>another</b> experience also." [...] They used music that Leslie Bricusse and his former musical collaborator Anthony Newley had created for the 1971 movie, and Bricusse also wrote new songs with a [...] "retro-sounding" [...] style that matched the earlier music.
