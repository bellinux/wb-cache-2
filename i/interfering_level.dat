40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a new channel assignment strategy for a broadband multi-beam High Altitude Platform (HAP) architecture that exploits cell overlap. This scheme delivers equal data rate capacity to users and the blocking probability {{seen by the}} users is independent of the area. Exploiting cell overlap reduces the overall levels of blocking and improves {{the capacity of the}} system. As users in the overlap regions experience higher <b>interfering</b> <b>levels,</b> they require more channels to fulfil the minimum bits per connection per frame threshold required. The increased demand for channels is fulfilled thanks to the higher trunking efficiency in the areas of overlap. This threshold in conjunction with the RAF has ensured uniform blocking across the areas as well as equal data rates across the user connections. For the parameters chosen it is shown that the blocking probability is reduced from 4 % to 2. 6 % by exploiting this technique...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{various ways}} to deliver efficient and practical resource allocation techniques for a broadband multi-beam High Altitude Platform (HAP) communication system using frequencies in the LMDS band (28 GHz) and above. The hypothesis being tested is that HAP communication systems {{can take advantage}} of their physical architecture and exploit cell overlap to maximise the capacity of the network while ensuring fairness in the Quality of Service (QoS) across the coverage area. Performance is judged in terms of blocking and dropped call probability against traffic load; particular attention is paid to fairness of QoS. Through both analysis and computer modelling, an attempt is made to accurately determine practical and near-optimal schemes for optimising the capacity of a HAP communication system whilst maintaining a fair service. Fixed Channel Allocation strategies are examined and the network performance is compared with and without exploiting cell overlap. It is shown that exploiting cell overlap reduces the overall levels of blocking and improves the capacity of the system. It also reduces the dropping levels when the aerial platform starts to move.

40|$|PURPOSE: to {{investigate}} the efficacy of electric field shaping in modulating the extent and activation threshold in retinal neurostimulation. This study aims to quantify the interference of neighbouring stimulation sites by assessing the shift in the activation threshold produced by a concomitant interfering stimulus. METHODS: electrical stimuli were applied to healthy retinae in a feline model (n= 4) using a 24 -channel electrode array surgically implanted in the suprachoroidal space. A 96 -channel penetrating electrode array was used for recording cortical responses {{to a number of}} stimulation paradigms. Data were analyzed off-line. Concurrent monopolar and hexapolar stimuli were delivered at primary and interfering sites separated by up to 2. 19 mm to evaluate electric cross-talk. The spike rate was fit to a sigmoidal curve to estimate the P 50 threshold. The slope of the linear regression of the P 50 value versus <b>interfering</b> current <b>level</b> was considered as a measure of cross-talk. RESULTS: concurrent monopolar stimulation produced a proportional drop in the P 50 of approximately 20 % of the <b>interfering</b> current <b>level</b> in presence of both a primary monopolar and hexapolar stimulus. On the other hand, hexapolar interference did not alter activation thresholds at the primary site. CONCLUSIONS: hexapolar stimulation reduces electric cross-talk between neighboring sites and represents a technique to reduce interference between individual stimulation sites. In contrast, concurrent monopolar stimulation produces a reduction of the activation threshold of stimuli delivered nearby. Thus, a single source of sub-threshold monopolar charge injection can provide benefit in the form of significant threshold reduction simultaneously at multiple stimulation sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectral}} line polarization produced by optically pumped atoms contains {{a wealth of}} information on the thermal and magnetic structure of a variety of astrophysical plasmas, including that of the solar atmosphere. A correct decoding of such information from the observed Stokes profiles requires a clear understanding of the effects that radiatively induced quantum interferences (or coherences) between pairs of magnetic sublevels produce on these observables, in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on the role of coherences between pairs of sublevels pertaining to different fine-structure J-levels, clarifying when they can be neglected for facilitating the modeling of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes in {{spectral line}}s. To this end, we apply the quantum theory of spectral line polarization and calculate the linear polarization patterns of the radiation scattered at 90 degrees by a slab of stellar atmospheric plasma, taking into account and neglecting the above-mentioned quantum interferences. Particular attention is given to the 2 S- 2 P, 5 S- 5 P, and 3 P- 3 S multiplets. We point out the observational signatures of this kind of interferences and analyze their sensitivity to the energy separation between the <b>interfering</b> <b>levels,</b> to the amount of emissivity in the background continuum radiation, to lower-level polarization, and to the presence of a magnetic field.
