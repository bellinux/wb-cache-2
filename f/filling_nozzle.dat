In order to initiate the filling process, the driver must enter an identification card in a card reader. With the device, {{it will be able to}} determine the precise location of the <b>filling</b> <b>nozzle</b> for the automatic filling of the vehicle irrespective of the type of vehicle or its dimensions. In order to be able to fill a wide variety of different vehicles automatically, the vehicle has a positioning element which can be scanned by a transmit and receive device.

40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The <b>filling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the fuel tank filler neck. If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the filler neck. In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the filler neck of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the filler neck, the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} {{development of}} sophisticated aircraft with high fidelity control systems will enable autonomous execution of challenging {{tasks such as}} aerial refueling and close formation flight. In order to achieve such tasks autonomously, an aircraft must sense other aircraft in close proximity and position itself relative to them. For example, formation-flying aircraft must position themselves strategically to realize benefits of aerodynamic ef-ficiency; aerial refueling requires the follower aircraft to intercept the <b>filling</b> <b>nozzle</b> attached to the leader aircraft. This paper uses lifting-line theory to represent a two-aircraft formation and presents a grid-based, recursive Bayesian filter for estimating the wake parameters of the lead aircraft using noisy pressure measurements distributed along the trailing aircraft’s wing; the estimator also utilizes a binary, relative-altitude measurement to break the vertical symmetry. The paper employs measures of observability to quantify spatial regions prone to degraded estimation performance. Opti-mal control strategies are presented to steer the follower aircraft to a desired lateral position relative to the leader while simultaneously optimizing the observability of the leader’s relative position. The control algorithms guide the follower aircraft along trajectories that maintain adequate observabil-ity, thereby guaranteeing estimator performance. Theoretical results are illustrated using numerical examples of a two-aircraft formation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{critical}} challenges encountered when modeling a thermo-mechanical problem {{in the context of}} steel casting processes, is to achieve a concurrent and efficient computation of fluid flow (ingot mould <b>filling,</b> <b>nozzle</b> jet in continuous casting) and solid mechanics (stress-strain in solidified regions). This is of crucial importance in industry for the prediction of surface or sub-surface cracks for instance that may initiate in solidified regions during the filling stage of ingot casting, or in the mould region during continuous casting. The current state-of-the-art [15 - 17 - 21] consists in separating the analysis in two distinct stages: fluid flow using CFD codes and stress-strain analysis using structural codes. This induces several drawbacks regarding practical use and computational efficiency. A monolithic formulation, treating the fluid-solid interaction (FSI) may be investigated but is not adapted to the context of solidification, because of huge differences between liquid viscosity and solid consistency. It is then preferable to consider this FSI problem as a weak interaction problem, for which a partitioned formulation is more efficient than a monolithic one. Therefore, a two-step resolution strategy combining fluid flow and solid mechanics has been developed. Liquid flow (natural convection or filling flow), thermal dilatation as well as thermally induced deformation of the solid phase are accounted for...|$|E
40|$|These days an {{alternative}} to soft capsules is liquid-filled hard capsules. Their filling technology was investigated earlier with highly viscous formulations, while hardly any academic research focused on low-viscosity systems. Accordingly, this work addressed the filling of such oils that are splashing during the dosing process. It was aimed to first study capsule filling, using middle-chain triglycerides as reference oil, in order to then evaluate {{the concept of a}} new theoretical splashing degree for different oils. A laboratory-scale filling machine was used that included capsule sealing. Thus, the liquid encapsulation by microspray technology was employed to seal the dosage form. As a result of the study with reference oil, the filling volume and the temperature were found to be significant for the rate of leaking capsules. The filling volume was also important for weight variability of the capsules. However, most critical for this variability was the diameter of the <b>filling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> We proposed a power law for the coefficient of weight variability {{as a function of the}} nozzle diameter and the obtained exponent agreed with the proposed theory. Subsequently, a comparison of different oils revealed that the relative splashing degree shared a correlation with the coefficient of the capsule weight variability (Pearson product moment correlation of r[*]=[*] 0. 990). The novel theoretical concept was therefore found to be predictive for weight variability of the filled capsules. Finally, guidance was provided for the process development of liquid-filled capsules using low-viscosity oils...|$|E
50|$|As the {{altitude}} rises, the jet becomes progressively under-expanded and grows until it <b>fills</b> the <b>nozzle,</b> {{at which point}} the gas provides more pressure against the rest of the nozzle and thrust and specific impulse increases.|$|R
50|$|The nozzle {{operates}} in two distinct modes: open and closed. In closed wake mode, the exhaust gas <b>fills</b> the entire <b>nozzle</b> exit area. The ambient pressure {{at which the}} wake changes from open to closed modes is called the design pressure. If the ambient pressure reduces any further, additional expansion will occur outside the nozzle much like a standard bell nozzle and no altitude compensation effect will be gained. In open wake mode, the exit area {{is dependent on the}} ambient pressure and the exhaust gas exits the nozzle as an annulus as it does not <b>fill</b> the entire <b>nozzle.</b> Because the ambient pressure controls the exit area, the area ratio should be perfectly compensating to the altitude up to the design pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discuss the}} {{separation}} of the miscible liquids by means of fractional distillation. For complete separation of liquids, the process of heating, condensation, separation and storage is done automatically to achieve the objective. PIC micro-controller has been used to control each and every process of the work. The controller also controls the storage process by activating and deactivating the conveyors. The liquids are heated which on reaching their respective boiling points evaporate and enter the condensation chamber where they convert into liquid. The liquids are then directed to their respective tanks by means of stepper motor which moves in three directions, each movement into different tank. The tank on filling sends the signal to controller which then opens the solenoid valves. The tank is emptied into the beakers below the nozzle. As the beaker <b>filled,</b> the <b>nozzle</b> closes and the conveyors come into operation. The filled beaker is replaced by an empty beaker from behind. The work can be used in oil industries, chemical industries and paint industries...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) {{is not limited}} to prototype manufacturing, but is also used to generate parts with final applications. This paper considers this aspect of 3 D printing, and aims to characterize fatigue life of parts manufactured through fused filament fabrication. This {{is one of the most}} complex AM technologies, due to the high number of parameters that must be taken into account. The knowledge of the influence of the different manufacturing parameters on the mechanical behavior of the parts has been previously considered for static forces, but so far, dynamic working regimes have not been explored. In this paper, a design of experiments through Taguchi orthogonal arrays is applied to analyze the influence of five factors on fatigue life on PLA specimens. Five fatigue tests are performed for each combination of parameters. Results show that <b>fill</b> density, <b>nozzle</b> diameter and layer height are the most influential factors on fatigue lifespan.

40|$|Critical {{contamination}} {{sites and}} {{sources for the}} Gram-negative psychrotrophs (GNP) of the taxa Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas, and the Gram-positive spore-forming (GPS) species Bacillus cereus, have been traced in the production line of pasteurised milk. Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the filling machines, were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the filling machine contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the <b>filling</b> <b>nozzles,</b> in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} filling machine, and in air surrounding the filling machine. Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the filling machine over long periods, especially at the bottom of the filling machine. The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the filling machine was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant. By using traditional microbiological methods and RAPD-typing, the pasteurised milk was once found to be contaminated by B. cereus while passing through one pasteuriser, and commonly found to be contaminated during the filling procedure...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the fatigue {{response}} of PLA parts manufactured through fused filament fabrication (FFF). The influence of four factors (layer height, <b>fill</b> density, <b>nozzle</b> diameter and velocity) on the fatigue performance of cylindrical specimens is studied through an L 27 Taguchi experimental design. This design is run for two different infills: linear and honeycomb. Specimens have been tested on a rotating fatigue bending machine. The optimal set of parameters and levels resulting in {{the highest number of}} cycles to failure have been determined, and implemented to manufacture a second set of specimens, which have been tested at different stress levels to represent the Wöhler curve. Fill density proves to be the most influential parameter on fatigue life, followed by layer height. The tests undertaken to represent the Wöhler curve revealed that 35. 8 MPa can be considered as a lower threshold of the endurance limit for this kind of specimens. This value can be useful to use these devices to manufacture human implants, as PLA is a biocompatible material. The main novelty of this paper is that no previous fatigue life assessment of PLA parts manufactured through FFF has been developed. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluid flow}} and {{solidification}} of ingot casting was studied. In this study, the fluid flow during the bottom teeming process was investigated with water model experiments and numerical simulation. A user-defined liquid-solid two-phase solidification solver was developed {{based on the}} software platform of OpenFOAM, using Euler-Euler two-phase approach. The solidification solver was performed on a 3 -dimensional model of steel ingot to simulate the solidification and macrosegregation distribution. In water model experiments, water and vegetable oil were used to simulate the molten steel and slag phase, respectively. The influence of model parameters, such as the <b>filling</b> rate, <b>nozzle</b> dimensions and oil film thickness, on the filling conditions was investigated, concerning two aspects: one is the slag entrapment, {{and the other is}} reoxidation of molten steel. Both of the two situations should be avoid to provide a better filling condition. The numerical simulation on water-air two-phase flow with the interFoam solver of OpenFOAM was performed. The obtained predictions were in good agreement with the water model experiments. The simulation of solidification can obtain the evolution of the solid fraction, velocity, temperature, concentration and grain density fields. The macrosegregation was indicated by the concentration of the only solute − carbon. The cone-shaped negative segregation at the bottom, positive segregation at the top, V-segregation at the upper center of the ingot, and the channel-shaped A-segregation were predicted. The simulation results of macrosegregation ratio on certain lines were generally in agreement with the experimental measurements from the literature, except for some deviations at the bottom and the near-wall regions, where the predicted degree of negative segregation was much stronger than the measured one...|$|R
40|$|Refractory sand {{used for}} <b>filling</b> the taphole <b>nozzle</b> in slide-gate system of steel ladle needs {{to form a}} {{suitable}} sintered crust to prevent molten metal from {{direct contact with the}} gate system which, when opened, permits flow of metal from the ladle through the taphole well. Conventional filler sand consists of powdered mixtures of at least two compositions with suitable particle size and mass ratio. We herein propose a novel core-shell-structured composite particle as the refractory sand. Silicon carbide (SiC) particles with an average diameter of 50 mu M were oxidized in air at 1100 - 1600 degrees C to form SiC@SiO 2 core-shell structure. As the oxidation temperature increases, silica weight-ratio increases from 0. 8 to 7. 9 wt. %, equivalent to a calculated shell thickness of 20 - 157 nm, respectively. The crust thickness can be tailored by adjusting the shell thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the core shell structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.

40|$|The {{concept of}} dual-bell nozzle, first {{proposed}} by Foster and Cowles in 1949 [1] has received renewed attention {{in recent years}} due to its one-step altitude adaptation capability [1 - 6]. This concept uses two shortened nozzles combined into one with a bump or inflection point between them, as shown in Fig. 1. During ascent it functions first at the lower area-ratio with controlled flow separation occurring at the inflection point, Fig. 1 (a). While the lower area-ratio helps to achieve high sea-level thrust, a controlled and symmetrical flow separation helps avoid dangerous side-loads. As the altitude increases and the gases expand further, the flow undergoes a transition process during which the flow jumps downstream and attaches itself close to the nozzle exit, with the flow <b>filling</b> the full <b>nozzle</b> exit section thereby utilizing the full geometrical area-ratio, Fig. 1 (b). Because of the higher area-ratios that are achievable through this design, a higher vacuum performance is feasible.

40|$|The {{development}} of, {{and initial}} test data from, a nondetonating Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) simulator {{tested in the}} NASA Glenn 1 x 1 foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel (SWT) is presented in this paper. The concept is a pulsed ejector driven by the simulated exhaust of a PDE. This pro- gram is applicable to a PDE entombed in a ramjet flowpath, i. e., a PDE combined-cycle propulsion system. The ejector primary flow is a pulsed, uiiderexpanded, supersonic nozzle simulating the supersonic waves ema- nating from a PDE, while the ejector secondary flow is the 1 x 1 foot SWT test section operated at subsonic Mach numbers. The objective is not to study the detonation details, but the wave physics including t,he start- ing vortices, the extent of propagation of the wave front, {{the reflection of the}} wave from the secondary flowpath walls, and the timing of these events of a pulsed ejector, and correlate these with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code predictions. Pulsed ejectors have been shown to result in a 3 to 1 improvement in LID (length-to-diameter) and a near 2 to 1 improvement in thrust augmentation over a steady ejector. This program will also explore the extent of upstream interactions between an inlet and large, periodically applied, backpressures to the inlet as would be present due to combustion tube detonations in a PDE. These interactions could result in inlet unstart or buzz for a supersonic mixed compression inlet. The design of the present experiment entailed the use of an 2 -t diagram characteristics code to study the <b>nozzle</b> <b>filling</b> and purging timescales as well as a series of CFD analyses conducted using the WIND code.

40|$|The 3 {{dimensional}} printing (3 DP), {{called to}} additive manufacturing (AM) or rapid prototyping (RP), is emerged to revolutionize manufacturing and completely transform how products are designed and fabricated. A {{great deal of}} research activities {{have been carried out}} to apply this new technology to a variety of fields. In spite of many endeavors, much more research is still required to perfect the processes of the 3 D printing techniques especially {{in the area of the}} large-scale additive manufacturing and flexible printed electronics. The principles of various 3 D printing processes are briefly outlined in the Introduction Section. New types of thermoplastic polymer composites aiming to specified functional applications are also introduced in this section. Chapter 2 shows studies about the metal/polymer composite filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. Various metal particles, copper and iron particles, are added into thermoplastics polymer matrices as the reinforcement filler. The thermo-mechanical properties, such as thermal conductivity, hardness, tensile strength, and fracture mechanism, of composites are tested to figure out the effects of metal fillers on 3 D printed composite structures for the large-scale printing process. In Chapter 3, carbon/polymer composite filaments are developed by a simple mechanical blending process with an aim of fabricating the flexible 3 D printed electronics as a single structure. Various types of carbon particles consisting of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), conductive carbon black (CCB), and graphite are used as the conductive fillers to provide the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with improved electrical conductivity. The mechanical behavior and conduction mechanisms of the developed composite materials are observed in terms of the loading amount of carbon fillers in this section. Finally, the prototype flexible electronics are modeled and manufactured by the FDM process using Carbon/TPU composite filaments and the FDM printer modified in Chapter 5. The mechanical properties are sensitively affected by the morphology of additive materials such as concentration, size, type, and shape. The printing parameters such as <b>fill</b> density, temperature, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, and layer thickness are also influential factors resulting in changes in final properties of 3 D printed objects. Thus, mechanical properties of the thermoplastic polymers, e. g. acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), as a function of fill density and printing temperature are studied in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes a way to modify the FDM printer for multi-material printing of flexible composite filaments in order to make single-structured 3 D electronics via FDM process. To achieve the goals, the dual-nozzle filament extrusion system is installed to the FDM printer and the part for filament feeding is modified in this chapter. ...|$|R
