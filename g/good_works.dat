He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of direct experience of God, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and <b>good</b> <b>works,</b> and the need for solitude if one wants to become a channel of divine grace to others.|$|E

Its design is grounded in our own experience using the materials with educators and students, and in research about human learning and development. In short, we know that just teaching about <b>good</b> <b>work</b> is not sufficient if we hope individuals will actually do <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> The Toolkit is based on a set of principles about how to most effectively encourage individuals to care about and to carry out <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> The materials are designed to guide participants through a series of questions central to understanding the importance of <b>good</b> <b>work</b> in our society...|$|R
5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of <b>good</b> <b>works</b> and prayers for the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected burial inside the church, which were now seen as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of burial aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for burial and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired place of burial. From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and the virtues of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita {{was sent}} to a {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook <b>good</b> <b>works</b> for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{by faith}} alone: The belief that believers are justified, or pardoned for sin, solely on {{condition}} of faith in Christ rather than a combination of faith and <b>good</b> <b>works.</b> For Protestants, <b>good</b> <b>works</b> are a necessary consequence rather than cause of justification.|$|E
40|$|PLEASE NOTE: This {{dissertation}} {{is under}} a publication contract. The author and publisher have requested a five-year embargo. This dissertation proposes an ecclesiological grounding for ‘good work’. In light of the limited attention ecclesiology has received in theologies of work, I argue that the church {{can be understood as}} generative for both the theology and practice of <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> This needed ecclesiological development takes seriously the role of context in the ongoing discernment of <b>good</b> <b>work</b> and it specifically explores how ecclesial life and practice shape and inform <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> It reviews prominent theological proposals, appraises them as far too abstract from context, and argues that Christian understandings of <b>good</b> <b>work</b> are inconceivable without the church. The church is not simply the recipient and a dispenser of a theology of work, but the locus of its development. The dissertation begins by introducing the conversation about theology and work and mapping potential ecclesiological and practical theological contributions. It continues with a survey of dominant motifs of work in Christian history and in modernity. Turning specifically to the contemporary conversation about theology and work, an analysis of four prominent theological proposals for <b>good</b> <b>work</b> highlights the ancillary role the church plays in each. The dissertation then argues for ways practical moral reasoning and critical attention to context require the church {{as a starting point for}} discerning <b>good</b> <b>work</b> and argues that all Christian ethics, including the ethics of <b>good</b> <b>work,</b> are the result of communal hermeneutical processes. This is further demonstrated through an exploration of the formative power of liturgy for <b>good</b> <b>work,</b> and in particular the ecclesial practices of Sabbath and eucharist. Finally, the study develops the ecclesiological claim that the church is itself a kind of ‘public’ (as an alternative society) and suggests implications of that claim for grounding <b>good</b> <b>work</b> in the church’s calling to be a public witness in the world to the true ends of creation. 2017 - 02 - 0...|$|R

25|$|For Wesley, <b>good</b> <b>works</b> {{were the}} fruit of one's {{salvation}}, not {{the way in which}} that salvation was earned. Faith and <b>good</b> <b>works</b> go hand in hand in Methodist theology: a living tree naturally and inevitably bears fruit. Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of eternal security, believing that salvation can be rejected. Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.|$|E

25|$|Sanctification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} in which God makes the believer holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people. The <b>good</b> <b>works</b> accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary outworking of the believer's salvation, though they do not cause the believer to be saved. Sanctification, like justification, is by faith, because doing <b>good</b> <b>works</b> is simply living as the son of God one has become.|$|E
25|$|Indulgences were {{introduced}} {{to allow for the}} remission of the severe penances of the early Church and granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom or at least imprisoned for the faith. They draw on the treasury of merit accumulated by Christ's superabundantly meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific <b>good</b> <b>works</b> and prayers in proportion to the devotion with which those <b>good</b> <b>works</b> are performed or prayers recited.|$|E
25|$|Wright however {{does not}} hold the view that <b>good</b> <b>works</b> {{contribute}} to one's salvation but rather that the final judgement is something we {{can look forward to}} as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgement will show that. Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of <b>good</b> <b>works</b> than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E

40|$|Work and the Aesthetic {{argues for}} the {{priority}} of a work-centred account of aesthetic interest. This 'Work Theory' proposes an internal relation between <b>good</b> <b>work</b> as an activity and our aesthetic interest in made things. Each is conceptually related to the other so that to be <b>good,</b> <b>work</b> as an activity must engage aesthetic interest; and aesthetic interest in products, in making, viewing and using them, is an interest in different aspects of <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> <b>Good</b> <b>work</b> is characterised around three elements, the technical, functional, and authentic, which essentially relate to work that is skilful, responsive to design problems, and freely chosen. Work Theory has important antecedents in the Arts and Crafts Movement, modern conceptions {{of the work of}} designers, and in existentialist accounts of free choice. Work Theory's core tenet of an internal relation between <b>good</b> <b>work</b> and aesthetic interest throws light on some problematic areas in philosophical aesthetics, including the nature of aesthetic interest, the relations of craft to art, aesthetic education, and what is meant by 'everyday aesthetics'. Work Theory also provides a framework for understanding what it is for lives to be aesthetic...|$|R
