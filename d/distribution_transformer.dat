2500|$|In {{three phase}} {{four-wire}} ("wye") electrical power systems, when the {{load on the}} phases is not exactly equal, there is some current in the neutral conductor. [...] Because both the primary and secondary of the <b>distribution</b> <b>transformer</b> are grounded, and the primary ground is grounded at more than one point, the earth forms a parallel return path for the neutral current, allowing part of the neutral current to continuously flow through the earth. [...] This arrangement is partially responsible for stray voltage.|$|E
40|$|Transformers {{are one of}} {{the better}} {{efficient}} components in the electricity distribution network. Basically substation <b>transformers</b> and <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> are currently used in the electricity distribution network in Sri Lanka. Evaluation on the purchasing price of the transformer is not enough during the purchasing process. There are losses due to no load losses and load losses in the transformer during life which is about 30 - 35 years. Therefore, transformer purchaser must be look at total life time cost of the transformer during the purchasing process. Traditionally, this evaluation is done based on Total Owning Cost (TOC). Currently in Sri Lanka, CEB does not use competitive bidding process in purchasing of <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers.</b> And also, CEB has not defined capitalization values for <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> to evaluate them based on TOC. Main objective of this research is to set up a methodology to calculate capitalization values for distribution transforms in Sri Lanka using IEEE loss evaluation guide. Capitalization values for <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> depend on capacity cost and energy cost, economic considerations and load profile of <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers.</b> In this research, capitalization values are calculated for three different load profiles, i. e. rural, semi urban and urban. A computer based methodology was developed to calculate capitalization values as an outcome of this research. In future, CEB can purchase <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> by using these capitalization values for different applications, i. e. rural electrification, loss reduction in urban cities, augmentation of <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers,</b> etc. And also, any other utility can use computer based model to calculate capitalization values for <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> at any given time corresponding to a set of economic and other parameters...|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that electric utilities use about 40 million <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> in supplying electricity to customers in the United States. Although utility <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> collectively have a high average efficiency, they account for approximately 61 billion kWh of the 229 billion kWh of energy lost annually {{in the delivery of}} electricity. <b>Distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> are being replaced over time by new, more efficient, lower-loss units during routine utility maintenance of power distribution systems. Maintenance is typically not performed on units in service. However, units removed from service with appreciable remaining life are often refurbished and returned to stock. <b>Distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> may be removed from service for many reasons, including failure, over- or underloading, or line upgrades such as voltage changes or rerouting. When <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> are removed from service, a decision must be made whether to dispose of the transformer and purchase a lower-loss replacement or to refurbish the transformer and return it to stock for future use. This report contains findings and recommendations on replacing utility <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> during routine maintenance, which is required by section 124 (c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> {{normally}} have ratings less than 200 kVA, although some national standards can allow for units up to 5000 kVA {{to be described}} as <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers.</b> Since <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> are energized for 24 hours a day (even when they don't carry any load), reducing iron losses has {{an important role in}} their design. As they usually don't operate at full load, they are designed to have maximum efficiency at lower loads. To have a better efficiency, voltage regulation in these transformers should be kept to a minimum. Hence they are designed to have small leakage reactance.|$|R

In this research 18 model districts are constructed that are representative for the Dutch build environment connected to the low-voltage network, which are applied in a case study to determine the future load demand of the <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers.</b> The results indicate a larger overloading of <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> in 2040 in the village and rural accessible districts, compared to the more urban district types.

40|$|Ferroresonance can induce an {{undesired}} over-voltage {{often accompanied}} with a phase reversal which can damage power <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> and motors and cause {{injury to the}} system operators. Similarly, under some conditions, power <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> can excite subharmonic frequencies which in turn can damage the transformer winding and loads connected to the grid lines. While present analysis tools are based on analytical or experimental investigations, no rigorous systematic way exists to analyze ferroresonance and subharmonic problems in power <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers.</b> The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} systematic methodology to study ferroresonance and subharmonic problems in power <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers,</b> particularly, their existence, stability, and bifurcations. The methodology proposed for studying the ferroresonance problem is the generalized state-space averaging technique. Both single-phase and three-phase ferroresonance are considered. Appropriate models are developed for the single phase and three-phase power <b>distribution</b> <b>transformers</b> which are suitable {{for the study of the}} ferroresonance problem, i. e, low frequency models. The theory of the incremental-input describing function is revisited and a subtle flaw in the formulation of the theory is modified to address the stability of general systems, particularly at synchronous frequency. A generalized Nyquist criterion is presented to assess the stability of the periodic solutions. The modified incremental-input describing function theory is applied to single-phase ferroresonance systems. by Jama A Mohamed. Thesis (Sc. D.)
