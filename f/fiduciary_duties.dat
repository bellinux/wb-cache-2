50|$|<b>Fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> {{has long}} been a {{contentious}} issue, especially in the US. Asset managers and advisers have often cited <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> as a reason for not incorporating ESG factors into the investment decision-making process, claiming that looking at non-financial indicators was not consistent with their <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R
25|$|Therefore, it is {{said the}} <b>fiduciary</b> has a <b>duty</b> {{not to be in}} a {{situation}} where personal interests and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflicts with another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty,</b> and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent.

25|$|<b>Fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> are {{prescribed}} by the applicable {{laws of the}} fund’s jurisdiction and are inviolable. Responsibilities are prescribed through contractual terms in the various fund documents. Fund governance responsibilities can vary widely between investment funds because fund documents are commonly negotiated between fund stakeholders based on their various (often competing) requirements and objectives. Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> typically require the board {{to act in the}} best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.|$|E

2500|$|When a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> is imposed, equity {{requires}} a different, stricter, standard of behavior than the comparable tortious {{duty of care}} at common law. The <b>fiduciary</b> has a <b>duty</b> {{not to be in}} a situation where personal interests and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflict, not to be in a situation where his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflicts with another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty,</b> and a duty not to profit from his fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a conflict of interest. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves [...] "at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd" [...] and that [...] "he distinguishing or overriding <b>duty</b> of a <b>fiduciary</b> is the obligation of undivided loyalty".|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} fields with which Plato-Shinar is {{identified}} is the bank’s <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b> She has addressed this matter {{in many of the}} articles that she has published in Israel and abroad, as well as in her book - The Bank's <b>Fiduciary</b> Duty: The <b>Duty</b> of Loyalty - which was published in 2010 by the Israel Bar Association (in Hebrew). Plato-Shinar presents a balanced approach to the bank’s <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b> On the one hand, she favours the imposition of the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> towards customers, guarantors and mortgagers as an instrument for ensuring fair conduct {{on the part of the}} Bank; while on the other hand, she emphasizes the need to determine reasonable boundaries to the duty. In addition, she has reservations about expanding the bank's <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> towards other third parties. The views expressed in her book and her articles have been adopted by the Supreme Court in various rulings that dealt with the bank's <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> and became binding precedents.|$|R

40|$|Under {{the mandate}} of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC is soliciting public {{opinions}} on whether broker-dealers {{should be subject to}} a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> when advising retail and institutional investors. This paper focuses on the advisability of such a proposal for institutional investors. It shows that (1) a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> could potentially enhance broker-dealers’ standard of conduct for only a subset of institutional investors who are well capitalized, capable of assessing risks independently, and acknowledge in writing their non-reliance on broker-dealers’ advice. Thus, the benefit of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> is much narrower than what its proponents believe. (2) Institutional investors face substantial obstacles in recovering damages from broker-dealers who violate their standard of conduct in private litigation, and yet <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> would not help in this regard. In light of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty’s</b> negligible benefit but indeterminate cost to the financial industry, it is not a viable measure for enhancing institutional investor protection...|$|R

25|$|A <b>fiduciary's</b> <b>duty</b> {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b> Conflicts between one <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> and another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|R
25|$|Husbands {{and wives}} are not {{presumed to be}} in a {{fiduciary}} relationship; however, this may be easily established. Similarly, ordinary commercial transactions in themselves are not presumed to but can give rise to <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties,</b> should the appropriate circumstances arise. These are usually circumstances where the contract specifies a degree of trust and loyalty or it can be inferred by the court.|$|E
25|$|If {{fiduciary}} {{relationships are}} to arise between employers and employees, {{it is necessary}} to ascertain that the employee has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer.

25|$|Secret commissions, or bribes, {{also come}} under the no profit rule. The bribe shall be held in {{constructive}} trust for the principal. The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has committed a crime. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. <b>Fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> are an aspect of equity and, {{in accordance with the}} equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.|$|E
25|$|The LOE prescribes {{that the}} Director of a LLC may be sued by {{shareholders}} should he fail to perform his obligations and duties.

While the law lays out the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.|$|E

Both X and Y hold <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest.

The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
