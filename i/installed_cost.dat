5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W <b>installed</b> <b>cost,</b> is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
25|$|In heating mode, {{heat pumps}} are {{three to four}} times more {{effective}} at heating than simple electrical resistance heaters using the same amount of electricity. Typically <b>installed</b> <b>cost</b> for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for resistance heaters.|$|E
25|$|Single- and multiple-pressure non-reheat steam cycles {{are applied}} to combined-cycle systems {{equipped}} with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 540°C or less.

25|$|CdTe {{is used to}} make {{thin film}} solar cells, {{accounting}} for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011. They are among the lowest-cost types of solar cell, although a comparison of total <b>installed</b> <b>cost</b> depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe solar cell market is dominated by First Solar. In 2011, around 2 GWp of CdTe solar cells were produced; For more details and discussion see cadmium telluride photovoltaics.|$|E

30|$|The {{transferring}} cost of each machine type {{between two}} periods is known. All machine types {{can be moved}} to the machine depot or any location in the cells. Even if a machine is removed from or returned to the cells, this transferring cost is incurred. This cost is paid for several situations: (1) to install a new purchased machine or a machine returned from the machine depot; (2) to uninstall a machine removed from a cell and kept in the machine depot; and (3) to transfer a machine between two different locations. Transferring machine contains uninstallation of a machine from a location and installation of that machine in another location. <b>Installing</b> and uninstalling <b>costs</b> {{are considered to be}} the same. Actually, if a machine is added to a cell, only the <b>installing</b> <b>cost</b> will be imposed. In the same way, if a machine is removed from a cell, only the uninstalling cost will be incurred. Then, if a machine is transferred between two different locations in the cells, both uninstalling and <b>installing</b> <b>costs</b> will be imposed. Thus, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the unit cost of adding or removing a machine to/from the cells is half of the transferring machine cost.|$|R

50|$|The chief {{disadvantage}} of central vacuums is higher initial cost. In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an <b>installed</b> <b>cost</b> of around $1,000.

50|$|Assuming a 50% future cost reduction, {{one could}} argue that the best case {{scenario}} for the 200 kW unit would be a capital (<b>installed)</b> <b>cost</b> comparable to today's 100 kW units, i.e., around $800,000. Using average electricity ($0.10/kWh) and natural gas ($3/MMBtu) prices and assuming a 6% per year maintenance/operating cost apart from fuel, the break-even period for the device comes to over 8 years, based on published performance numbers.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985, {{the pipe}} organ was removed due to {{building}} renovations requiring {{the installation of}} a new airshaft {{in place of the}} organ's pipes. The installation of a new pipe organ was estimated to cost in the millions of dollars, and was further anticipated to have complications due to the effect of varying temperature and humidity on the organ's intonation system. The prospect was thus determined to be cost-prohibitive. However, in August 2004, a new Rogers Trillium 3 digital electronic organ was <b>installed</b> (<b>costing</b> about $100,000).

50|$|Privatization {{can lead}} to price {{increases}} if the market is not otherwise profitable. An unregulated or lightly regulated market could tend towards proven profitable customers too, ignoring riskier opportunities to expand service to rural or poor customers.

According to the Forum of Energy Ministers of Africa, most rural customers can't even afford the <b>install</b> <b>costs</b> of the most basic single phase circuit with an electrical socket. Energy subsidies are one possible solution, but they can disproportionately effect demographics who already have access to electricity, missing the most poor.|$|R
