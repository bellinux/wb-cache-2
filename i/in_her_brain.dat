25|$|Hoey {{was found}} {{shot to death}} in an upstairs bedroom of oil heir Henry H. Rogers III's Indian Run Farm house, Wallace Township near Downingtown, Pennsylvania in 1935. A bullet was {{discharged}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> on the night of September 11. She had been a guest at the home for a week. Others present there during this time were Rogers, photographer William J. Kelley, a Japanese cook, George Yamada, a butler, and Rogers' chauffeur, Frank Catalano. Hoey's body was removed to a morgue in Downingtown. Later the body was taken to the county hospital in West Chester, Pennsylvania for an autopsy.|$|E
25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a rolled-up carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. Her ear was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; her mouth was injured so much that her bottom lip had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had found the body of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Milivi Adams was a {{girl from}} Vieques who {{developed}} and died of cancer and became a symbol {{in the battle against}} the presence of the military. Her face had appeared many times on the covers of Puerto Rican newspapers and magazines, and there were posters with her picture on them on many of Vieques' street corners. The daughter of Zuleyka Calderon and Jose Adams, Milivi was diagnosed with cancer at the age of two years. Although many people blamed the military's bomb testings in Vieques as the source of her cancer, this has not been proven. Given a month to live at the age of three, her cancer went into remission, but at the age of four reappeared, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> She was flown to the United States by her parents, in hopes that treatment would help her; she fought infections, and after the last one, doctors told her parents that her body would not resist another infection treatment. She returned to Puerto Rico, where she died on the morning of November17, 2002.|$|E
25|$|Grimwood's {{impressive}} debut novel, Breakthrough (Ballantine, 1976), {{was heavily}} influenced by EC Comics, concluding its blend of science fiction, reincarnation and horror elements with a surprising and unpredictable twist ending. Cured of epilepsy by a breakthrough in medical technology, 26-year-old Elizabeth Austin has miniature electrodes implanted <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> She can control her seizures by pressing an external remote to activate the electrodes. Adjusting to a normal life, she is ready to patch up a troubled marriage and resume her abandoned career. However, {{as part of the}} implant operation, Elizabeth gave her consent for the insertion of extra electrodes, featuring experimental functions unknown to science. When one of those electrodes is stimulated, Elizabeth experiences memories which are not her own. She discovers the remote has given her the ability to eavesdrop on her previous life 200 years in the past, and she keeps this a secret from her doctor. Intrigued, she finds the earlier existence appealing and begins to spend more and more time there. Eventually, she discovers that the woman in the past is a murderess who is plotting to kill Elizabeth's husband in the present.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Lieder, {{a self-proclaimed}} contactee {{who claims to}} receive {{messages}} from aliens through an implant <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> stated that Hale–Bopp was a fiction designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of [...] "Nibiru" [...] or [...] "Planet X", a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth's rotation, causing global cataclysm. Although Lieder's original date for the apocalypse, May 2003, passed without incident, predictions of the imminent arrival of Nibiru continued by various conspiracy websites, most of whom tied it to the 2012 phenomenon.|$|E

60|$|So {{they began}} to gossip, and the sober talk was over for that time, but when Kitty departed, after criticizing all her dear friends and their {{respective}} sweethearts, she had a helpful little book <b>in</b> <b>her</b> muff, a resolute expression on her bright face, and so many excellent plans for self-improvement <b>in</b> <b>her</b> busy <b>brain</b> that she and Steve bid fair to turn out the model couple of the century.|$|R
500|$|The {{idea was}} first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder, {{founder of the}} website ZetaTalk. Lieder {{describes}} herself as a contactee {{with the ability to}} receive messages from extraterrestrials from the Zeta Reticuli star system through an implant <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003 (though that date was later postponed) causing Earth to undergo a physical pole shift that would destroy most of humanity. The prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder's website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups, most of which linked the event to the 2012 phenomenon. Since 2012, the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media, usually linked to newsmaking astronomical objects such as Comet ISON or Planet Nine. Although the name [...] "Nibiru" [...] is derived from the works of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin and his interpretations of Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of the}} Nibiru {{encounter}} {{originated with}} Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims that as a girl she was contacted by gray extraterrestrials called Zetas, who implanted a communications device <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> In 1995, she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas. Lieder first came to public attention on Internet newsgroups during the build-up to Comet Hale–Bopp's 1997 perihelion. She stated, claiming to speak as the Zetas, that [...] "The Hale–Bopp comet does not exist. It is a fraud, perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late. Hale–Bopp {{is nothing more than}} a distant star, and will draw no closer." [...] She claimed that the Hale–Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object, [...] "Planet X", which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization. After Hale–Bopp's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest-observed comets of the last century, Lieder removed the first two sentences of her initial statement from her site, though they can still be found in Google's archives. Her claims eventually made the New York Times.|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2009, a woman {{claimed to}} have {{suffered}} a head injury from riding Son of Beast during her visit to the park on May 31, 2009. She did not report the incident to Kings Island officials prior to June 16. She {{claimed to have}} suffered from a burst blood vessel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> after riding Son of Beast, that required admission to an intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. [...] "The first we heard of this was on June 16. Her visit was on May 31 and there's no record of going to first aid for anything here at the park," [...] said Don Helbig, public relations manager for Kings Island. Helbig {{also pointed out that}} there were no other reports of injuries on the ride that year. The Son of Beast was shut down as a precaution, however, during the investigation. [...] "At this point it would be inappropriate to speculate on an exact date when the ride may reopen. We're going to do a thorough maintenance review. We're going to work with the state of Ohio on that," [...] said Helbig.|$|E
60|$|She wove {{to herself}} dreams of {{possible}} delights with Sylvia and Charlie, if the summer visit could {{be paid to}} them; {{and at other times}} she imagined her Uncle Giles's two daughters still alive, and sent home for education, arranging <b>in</b> <b>her</b> busy <b>brain</b> wonderful scenes, in which she, with their assistance, should be happy in spite of Aunt Barbara.|$|R

500|$|After her death, Schiavo's {{body was}} taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Florida. The autopsy {{occurred}} on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as [...] "undetermined". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, M.D. In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson, M.D.), Dr. Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The brain itself weighed only , only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. The neuropathologic changes <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal neurons that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen {{from the front of the}} cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, [...] "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons." ...|$|E
500|$|Six months later, {{a race of}} villainous robots {{known as}} the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he {{scatters}} them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where six years have passed and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device {{to return to his}} friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, the Blue Typhoon. On the Typhoon, they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and [...] "Planet Eggs" [...] (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.) [...] At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metered independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an unwitting spy ever since. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely destroy her sight and hearing forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses {{to find a way to}} remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1967, Terrell {{collapsed}} in Gaye's arms during a performance in Farmville, Virginia. Terrell was subsequently rushed to Farmville's Southside Community Hospital, where doctors discovered {{she had a}} malignant tumor <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> The diagnosis ended Terrell's career as a live performer, though she continued to record music under careful supervision. Despite the presence of hit singles such as [...] "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" [...] and [...] "You're All I Need to Get By", Terrell's illness caused problems with recording, and led to multiple operations to remove the tumor. Gaye was reportedly devastated by Terrell's sickness and became disillusioned with the record business.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{conclusive}} {{identification of}} T. gondii in humans {{was in an}} infant girl delivered full term by Caesarean section on May 23, 1938, at Babies' Hospital in New York City. [...] The girl began having seizures at three days of age, and doctors identified lesions in the maculae of both of her eyes. When she died at one month of age, an autopsy was performed. Lesions discovered <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> and eye tissue {{were found to have}} both free and intracellular T. gondii. [...] Infected tissue from the girl was homogenized and inoculated intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; the animals subsequently developed encephalitis. Later, congenital transmission was found to occur in numerous other species, particularly in sheep and rodents.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 a {{post-mortem}} inquest {{into the}} death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death {{was caused by a}} form of early-onset beta amyloid angiopathy, a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: [...] "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."
