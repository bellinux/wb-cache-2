5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
25|$|Improving {{the quality}} of gemstones by {{treating}} them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> ruby prices.|$|E

25|$|Australia's {{dependence}} on agricultural and industrial exports meant {{it was one}} of the hardest-hit developed countries. Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> wages. Unemployment reached a record high of 29% in 1932, with incidents of civil unrest becoming common. After 1932, an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{development}} of increased oil production in California had consequences. The additional California oil fields, along with booming oil supplies in Texas and Oklahoma, put <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the price.

25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income. This subsidy encourages people to buy more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> premium prices). CBO estimates the net effect is to increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{economy was}} {{primarily}} agricultural {{in the early}} 19th century. Westward expansion plus the building of canals {{and the introduction of}} steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama, and new grain growing areas were brought into production in the Mid West. Eventually this put severe <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> prices, particularly of cotton, first from 1820 to 1823 and again from 1840 to 1843.|$|E

25|$|The {{inability}} of the Russian government to implement a coherent set of economic reforms led to a severe erosion in investor confidence and a chain reaction that can be likened to a run on the Central Bank. Investors fled the market by selling rubles and Russian assets (such as securities), which also put <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the ruble. This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble. It is estimated that between 1 October 1997 and 17 August 1998, the Central Bank expended approximately $27billion of its U.S. dollar reserves to maintain the floating peg.|$|E
25|$|Farming is subsidised, with {{subsidies}} to farmers totalling Â£3.19 billion (after deduction of levies) paid in 2010. These subsidies are mostly channelled through the EU Common Agricultural Policy from member states' contributions. UK farmers receive the fifth largest agricultural subsidy in the EU, with 7% of the subsidy, after France (17%), Spain (13%), Germany (12%), and Italy (10%). There is <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the subsidies and on 19 November 2010, the EU announced a reform starting in 2013.

Between 1979 and 2010, productivity grew by 49%, output volumes by 25% and input volumes fell by 16%.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of the German Empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the value of silver; this had a knock-on effect in the USA, {{where much of the}} supply was then mined. As a result, the United States Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873, which changed the country's silver policy. Before the Act, the United States had backed its currency with both gold and silver, and it minted both types of coins. The Act moved the United States to a 'de facto' gold standard, which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or convert silver from the public into silver coins (though it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars).|$|E

25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18â22.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the cyclical fluctuations of price-cost margins, following an extended version of the Rotemberg and Woodford (1991) approach. The results support the hypothesis of counter-cyclical price margins in most manufacturing industries, especially {{in the presence of}} downward rigidities of labour inputs. This is consistent with a growing body of empirical literature showing that economic booms tend to increase competition or decrease the incentives for collusion, thereby creating <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> price margins. It also offers an appealing interpretation of the otherwise puzzling pro-cyclicality of real wages. ...|$|R

Recently, the objective of poverty alleviation has been adversely impacted by the <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> world prices (exacerbated by subsidies by major cotton producers outside Africa). Several countries in WCA are undergoing reforms in the cotton sector to stimulate greater market competition and raise {{the share of the}} international price going to farmers. While these efforts would help to improve rural income irrespective of the world market situation, they would be more powerful in combination with a reduction in other countriesâ subsidies in this sector. ...|$|R
2500|$|Most economists {{believe the}} excise tax to be {{best of the}} three revenue raisers above, since (due to health care cost growth) it would grow fast enough to more than keep up with new {{coverage}} costs, and it would help to put <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> overall health care cost growth.

2500|$|In Marxian analysis, {{capitalist}} firms increasingly substitute {{capital equipment}} for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure {{to reduce costs}} and maximize profits. Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the [...] "reserve army of labour"). This process exerts a <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting {{in a situation of}} relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{of managed}} care argue that [...] "for-profit" [...] managed care has been an {{unsuccessful}} health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25â33% higher overhead {{at some of the}} largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 quality indicators reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance).

Little is known about whether such coordination can actually work. Analytical accounts have deduced its feasibility from national experiences with decentralized forms of coordination, while empirically only anecdotal evidence on its effectiveness is available. This article contributes to the analytical debate by pointing out the different logics of national and transnational bargaining coordination. Empirically, it tests the prospects for cross-border coordination by analyzing how Austrian collective agreements in the metal industry related to their German counterparts from 1969 to 2003. We conclude by discussing the implications for EU-level bargaining coordination...|$|R
50|$|In other words, {{how can the}} Marxian production-price {{constellation}} {{be justified}} in real economy? Marx considered, of course, {{that in the long}} run the average positive rate of profit is realized in capitalistic market economy. Then what is the logic to guarantee it considering the change of real wage rate? Adam Smith considered that competition among capitals effects <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> profits. But as is well known, Ricardo criticized Smith and claimed that competition can only equalize uneven rates of profits among capitals and never affect the level of the rate of profit itself, which is inherited by Marx. Walras and more clearly Schumpeter asserted that competition sweeps out profits completely.|$|R
2500|$|The {{practice}} of short selling was likely invented in 1609 by Dutch businessman Isaac Le Maire, a sizeable shareholder of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC in Dutch). Edward Stringham {{has written extensively}} on the development of sophisticated contracts on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in the seventeenth century, including short sale contracts. Short selling can exert <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the underlying stock, driving down the price of shares of that security. [...] This, combined with the seemingly complex and hard-to-follow tactics of the practice, has made short selling a historical target for criticism. At various times in history, governments have restricted or banned short selling.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have argued}} the {{depression}} {{was rooted in}} the 1870 Franco-Prussian War that hurt the French economy and, under the Treaty of Frankfurt, forced that country to make large war reparations payments to Germany. [...] The primary cause of the price depression in the United States was the tight monetary policy that the US followed {{to get back to}} the gold standard after the Civil War. [...] The US government was taking money out of circulation to achieve this goal, therefore there was less available money to facilitate trade. [...] Because of this monetary policy the price of silver started to fall causing considerable losses of asset values; by most accounts, after 1879 production was growing, thus further putting <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> prices due to increased industrial productivity, trade and competition.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, critics {{argued that}} investors taking large short positions in struggling financial firms like Lehman Brothers, HBOS and Morgan Stanley created {{instability in the}} stock market and placed additional <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> prices. In response, a number of countries introduced restrictive regulations on short-selling in 2008 and 2009. Naked short selling is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed [...] it was this practice that was commonly restricted. Investors argued that it was the weakness of financial institutions, not short-selling, that drove stocks to fall. In September 2008, the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States abruptly banned short sales, primarily in financial stocks, to protect companies under siege {{in the stock market}}. That ban expired several weeks later as regulators determined the ban was not stabilizing the price of stocks.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that regulatory competition does not necessarily lead to <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> regulation, but may at times also push the level of regulation upwards. Extending David Vogel's "California effect" argument, this paper shows that such upward pressure may not only result directly from the dynamics of the competitive process but also from international cooperation. Evidence from two case studies on international capital market regulation is used to identify the conditions under which cooperation in the shadow of regulatory competition is likely to succeed or fail. The successful multilateral standardisation of banking capital requirements in the BIS is compared to failed attempts to harmonise interest taxation across EC member states...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs a {{consequence}} of globalization, countries competitively undercut their corporate tax rates in order to lure and boost foreign capital investments. This context induces a {{race to the bottom}} in corporate income taxes and threatens the corporate tax revenues collection. This paper aims to establish if there is a paradox in relation to the corporate tax rate and corporate-tax-to-GDP-ratio in the European Union (the corporate tax rates reduction did not cause a corporate-tax-to-GDP-ratio drop), as this trend was observed by researchers. In order to assess the outcome of corporate tax competition as it is reflected by the firmsâ behavioural responses, a panel data for EU countries was used. The findings do not confirm that the <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> corporate tax rates are not translated in a fall in corporate revenues over the time...|$|R
