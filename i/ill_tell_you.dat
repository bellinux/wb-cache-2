5000|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, Candide was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed [...] "obscene", from reaching a Harvard University French class. Candide was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after Candides detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the offices decision to ban it, [...] "But about Candide, <b>Ill</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> For years weve been letting that book get by.

And dear Roger Moore walked over, took him by the lapels, looked him straight in the eyes and said, And to think those lips once kissed Piper Laurie. laughter Well, the whole of the Croisette collapsed, the unit collapsed, and, I must say, even Tony had to laugh, but we were asked to do another... we got the award that year for the best TV series, I think it was, and they wanted to do a repeat, and I remember Roger saying, With Tony Curtis, not on your life, and he went on to become James Bond, so he did all right."
