25|$|We take an illustrative {{synthetic}} bivariate {{data set}} of 50 points {{to illustrate the}} construction of histograms. This requires the choice of an anchor point (the lower left corner of the <b>histogram</b> grid). For the <b>histogram</b> on the left, we choose (−1.5,−1.5): for {{the one on the}} right, we shift the anchor point by 0.125 in both directions to (−1.625,−1.625). Both histograms have a binwidth of 0.5, so any differences are due to the change in the anchor point only. The colour-coding indicates the number of data points which fall into a bin: 0=white, 1=pale yellow, 2=bright yellow, 3=orange, 4=red. The left <b>histogram</b> appears to indicate that the upper half has a higher density than the lower half, whereas the reverse is the case for the right-hand <b>histogram,</b> confirming that histograms are highly sensitive to the placement of the anchor point.|$|E

40|$|<b>Histograms</b> are {{commonly}} used in content-based image retrieval systems to represent the distributions of colors in images. It is a common understanding that <b>histograms</b> that adapt to images can represent their color distributions more efficiently than do <b>histograms</b> with fixed binnings.

The comparing of <b>histograms</b> is given by preorder relation on the set of <b>histograms.</b> This relation should to be agreed with the condition of ordering of arguments <b>histograms</b> by ascendingly their importance. The pointwise interval uncorrelated changes are meant by the distortions of <b>histograms.</b> Necessary and sufficient conditions on the level of distortion of <b>histograms</b> are found under which the comparison of the two <b>histograms</b> is not changed. The study was conducted for three popular probabilistic methods of comparison: a)  using the mathematical expectation; b)  using the distribution function (stochastic dominance); c)  using probability of inequalities.

25|$|A <b>histogram</b> can {{be thought}} of as a simplistic kernel density estimation, which uses a kernel to smooth {{frequencies}} over the bins. This yields a smoother probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect distribution of the underlying variable. The density estimate could be plotted as an alternative to the <b>histogram,</b> and is usually drawn as a curve rather than a set of boxes.|$|E
25|$|Histograms give a rough {{sense of}} {{the density of the}} {{underlying}} distribution of the data, and often for density estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a <b>histogram</b> used for probability density is always normalized to 1.

40|$|Abstract: In {{addition}} to being invariant to image rotation and translation, <b>histograms</b> {{have the advantage of}} being easy to compute. These advantages make <b>histograms</b> very popular in computer vision. However, without data quantization to reduce size, <b>histograms</b> are generally not suitable for realtime applications. Moreover, they are sensitive to quantization errors and lack any spatial information. This paper presents a way to keep the advantages of <b>histograms</b> avoiding their inherent drawbacks using local kernel <b>histograms.</b> This approach is tested for background subtraction using indoor and outdoor sequences. ...|$|R

Once the average vertical and horizontal similarity score was determined, then the pairwise image distance was calculated as 1 - the pairwise image similarity.|$|R

The distribution shown indicates that the line-emitting regions of star-forming GPs are not highly reddened, particularly when compared to more typical star-forming or starburst galaxies. This low reddening combined with very high UV luminosity is rare in galaxies in the local Universe and is more typically found in galaxies at higher redshifts.|$|E

40|$|Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP), 2005, Havana (Cuba) In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method for {{comparing}} <b>histograms.</b> Its main advantage is that it takes less time than previous methods. The present distances between <b>histograms</b> are defined on a structure called signature, which is a lossless representation of <b>histograms.</b> Moreover, the type {{of the elements of}} the sets that the <b>histograms</b> represent are ordinal, nominal and modulo. We show that the computational cost of these distances is O(z′) for the ordinal and nominal types and O(z′ 2) for the modulo one, where z′ is the number of non-empty bins of the <b>histograms.</b> In the literature, the computational cost of the algorithms presented depends on the number of bins in the <b>histograms.</b> In most applications, the <b>histograms</b> are sparse, so considering only the non-empty bins dramatically reduces the time needed for comparison.

The most striking difference between kernel density estimates and histograms is that the former are easier to interpret since they do not contain artifices induced by a binning grid.|$|E
