Mesenchymal stem cells and their tissuespecific offspring, as osteoblasts and chondrocytes, cells of cardiovascular tissues and lung cells are sensitive to mechanical loading but molecules and mechanisms involved have to be unraveled. It is well established that cellular mechanotransduction is mediated e. g. by activation of the transcription factor SP 1 and by kinase signaling cascades resulting in the activation of the AP 1 complex. To investigate cellular mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction and to analyze substances, which modulate cellular mechanosensitivity reporter <b>gene</b> <b>constructs,</b> which can be transfected into cells of interest might be helpful. Suitable small-scale bioreactor systems and mechanosensitive reporter <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> are lacking. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction and its crosstalk with biochemically induced signal transduction, AP 1 and SP 1 luciferase reporter <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> were cloned and transfected into various cell lines and primary cells.

In summary we describe a small-scale cell culture/bioreactor system capable of analyzing subcellular crosstalk mechanisms in mechanotransduction, mechanosensitivity of primary cells and of screening the activity of putative mechanosensitizers as new targets, e. g. {{for the treatment of}} bone loss caused by both disuse and signal transduction related alterations of mechanotransduction...|$|R

Rearrangement of the transgene due to V kappa-J kappa recombination was observed in the spleen of all the mice lines analyzed. Only the J kappa 1 and J kappa 2 segments, which have canonical sequences for rearrangement and high-level expression, are utilized in assembly of the rabbit gene.

Only the reporter <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> containing a nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) sequence, the CCAAT sequence (nucleotides − 90 to − 86), an Sp- 1 sequence, and the two tandem SREs responded to cholesterol. The NF-Y-binding site, therefore, is essential for cholesterol response. Mutating the SREs or the NF-Y site and inserting 4 bp between the Sp- 1 - and NF-Y-binding sites both resulted in a minimal cholesterol response of the reporter genes. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using anti-SRE-binding protein (SREBP) and anti-NF-Ya antibodies confirmed that these SREs and the NF-Y site bind the respective factors. We also identified a second Sp- 1 site located between nucleotides − 40 and − 30 that can substitute for the mutated Sp- 1 site located between nucleotides − 82 and − 74. The reporter gene expression of the wild-type promoter and the Sp- 1 site (nucleotides − 82 to − 74) mutant promoter was similar when SREBP 1 a [the N-terminal domain of SREBP (amino acids 1 – 520) ] was constitutively overexpressed, suggesting that Sp- 1 recruits SREBP to the SREs.

40|$|Recent global flu {{pandemic}} highlights the obvious {{need for a}} vaccine against the influenza virus that is both inexpensive to produce and can be produced fast enough for development on a large scale. The influenza virus coat protein hemagglutinin (HA) is a major surface antigen and {{has emerged as a}} good candidate antigen for subunit vaccine development. Previous attempts to express HA from the A/Sichuan/ 2 / 87 H 3 N 2 influenza subtype in plastids achieved HA gene transcription but no protein accumulation, suggesting that the HA protein may be unstable in the plastid. The aim of this work is to investigate alternative strategies that might achieve HA antigen accumulation in plastids. Two series of <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> were made. The first series of constructs coded for the first 14 amino acids of GFP and RBCL N-terminally fused to the full length HA, a full length GFP N-terminally fused to HA and a full length GFP N-terminally fused to HA 1. The second series of <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> coded for two candidate influenza virus hemagglutinin epitopes, HA 91 - 108 and HA 307 - 319 fused singly as N and C terminal fusions and as double terminal fusions to full length GFP. A total of ten <b>gene</b> <b>constructs</b> were introduced into the chloroplast genome by biolistic bombardment. Transformants were generated and confirmed through molecular analyses. Transplastomic lines generated with the 14 aaRBCL/HA and 14 aaGFP/HA constructs accumulated a recombinant protein that was smaller than expected. Further analysis is required to confirm that these proteins are indeed truncated HA fusion proteins. No transformed plant lines were generated with the full length GFP/HA and GFP/HA 1 constructs suggesting that the tobacco plastid is not a useful system for producing full-length flu virus HA and HA 1 proteins suitable for vaccine development. Expression and stability of recombinant HA 91 - 108 /GFP and GFP/HA 307 - 319 fusion proteins was clearly demonstrated showing that conserved influenza virus HA epitopes can be expressed in plant chloroplasts. No transgene transcripts could be detected in transplastomic lines generated with the GFP/HA 91 - 108, HA 307 - 319 /GFP or HA 307 - 319 /GFP/HA 91 - 108 <b>gene</b> <b>constructs.</b> No transformed lines were generated with the HA 91 - 108 /GFP/HA 307 - 319 construct.
