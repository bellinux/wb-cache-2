Once the insulin is in place, the pod then primes itself to remove all air bubbles from the insulin reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Intrathecal {{drug therapy}} is being {{utilized}} increasingly {{for the treatment}} of chronic refractory pain. However, performing the regular pump refill procedures caries the potential risk of medication injection into the subcutaneous tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of this template-guided refill technique by means of fluoroscopic evaluation. Materials and Methods In 23 patients, the difference between the identification of the reservoir <b>fill</b> <b>port</b> center using the manufacturer's template and fluoroscopic guidance was assessed on four consecutive refill procedures by a two physicians. A distance surpassing that between the center and the margin of the port (3. 5 mm) was considered a clinically relevant deviation. Analyses were performed with a one-sample t-test, with p < 0. 05 indicating statistical significance. Results The mean difference distance between identification markings of the target with fluoroscopic guidance and with the template was 8. 2 -mm, with limited variance (2. 7 -mm). For all individual refill procedures, the port center identification accuracy differed significantly from zero (all p < 0. 001) and from the clinically relevant cut-off point of 3. 5 -mm (all p < 0. 001). Only seven attempts (6. 4 %) were within the margins of the <b>fill</b> <b>port.</b> Conclusions Our results suggest poor accuracy of insertion point identification using the template. This highlights the potential risk of errors related to identification of the puncture site using the template-guided technique...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Since {{removal of}} an {{infected}} tissue expander is very disappointing {{to both the}} surgeon and the patient, every effort is directed toward its salvage. This study evaluates a new method to salvage infected tissue expanders. Method: Of 66 tissue expanders applied at different sites in the body, 12 developed infection. Salvage {{was carried out by}} exteriorizing the buried port, followed by irrigation through the pocket of the tube that connects the port to the expander. Result: Salvage was successful in 9 of the infected tissue expanders and failed in 3 cases. The ports were not dependent in these 3 cases. Conclusion: Exteriorization of dependent ports allows adequate drainage, good access for irrigation, and completion of expansion. Radovan 1 in 1982 and Austad and Rose 2 in the same year introduced the use of tissue expanders to manage difficult reconstructive situations. While most surgeons adopted the buried port technique, some advocated external <b>filling</b> <b>ports.</b> 3 − 9 Infection of an expander is a devastating complication and traditional surgical prin-ciples dictate removal of the device. 10 Salvage has become an increasingly acceptable alternative to removal. 10 − 1...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{microfluidic}} systems, it {{has been difficult to}} devise pumping systems that can deliver adequate flow rates at high pressure for applications such as HPLC. An on-chip electrochemical pumping system based on electrolysis that offers certain advantages over designs that utilize electroosmotic driven flow has been fabricated and tested. The pump was fabricated on both silicon and glass substrates using photolithography. The electrolysis electrodes were formed from either platinum or gold, and SU 8, an epoxy-based photoresist, was used to form the pump chambers. A glass cover plate and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) gasket were used to seal the chambers. Filling of the chambers was accomplished by using a syringe to inject liquid via <b>filling</b> <b>ports,</b> which were later sealed using a glass cover plate. The current supplied to the electrodes controlled the rate of gas formation and, thus, the resulting fluid flow rate. At low backpressures, flow rates > 1 μL/min have been demonstrated using < 1 mW of power. Pumping at backpressures as high as 200 psi have been demonstrated, with 20 nL/min having been observed using < 4 mW.

40|$|Casein-gelatin beads {{have been}} {{prepared}} by emulsification extraction method and cross-linked with D,L-glyceraldehyde in an acetone water mixture 3 : 1 (v/v). Casein emulsifying properties cause air bubble incorporation {{and the formation of}} large holes in the beads. The high porosity of the matrix influences the bead properties such as drug loading, drug release and floatation. These effects have been stressed by comparison with low porous beads, artificially prepared without cavities. The percentage of casein in the matrix increases the drug loading of both low and high porous matrices, although the loading of high porous matrices is lower than that of low porous matrices. As a matter of fact, the drug should be more easily removed during washing and recovery because of the higher superficial pore area of the beads. This can explain the drug release rate increase, observed in high porous matrix, in comparison with beads without cavities. This is due to the rapid diffusion of the drug through water <b>filled</b> <b>ports.</b> The study shows that cavities act as an air reservoir and enable beads to float. Therefore, casein seems to be a material suitable to the inexpensive formation of an air reservoir for floating systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Ideal Drycleaners site {{consists}} of an abandoned and demolished former drycleaning facility. The facility is situated in downtown Livingston on about 0. 4 acres (17, 300 ft 2) in a mixed-use, residential and commercial block. The drycleaner property is flat; however, the grade {{of the street and}} adjacent properties is such that runoff drains south, then west to a storm water network which is routed to a channelized tributary of Town Creek. Ideal began drycleaning operations in the 1940 's and ceased in 1983. The facility mainly used stoddard solvent but also used tetrachloroethylene (PCE) during its operation. It also operated a fuel island for its fleet of delivery trucks. No records of solvent usage rates, wastes, or disposal for the operation were found. During demolition, three aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were observed, and two underground storage tanks (USTs) were discovered at the site. One UST was ruptured and released its contents to the soil and drainage network. Four additional USTs were later found at the site. PCE in free-product form was detected in one tank, all others contained mostly water contaminated with petroleum products, including stoddard solvent.

Results show that while the compacted coalwash conforms to typical structural fill criteria in terms of shear strength, the excessive deformation associated with change of particle size distribution due to particle breakage may render the material unsuitable in practice...|$|R

However, for mixtures compacted at their OMC, qu decreases with increasing SFS content.

40|$|Coal wash (CW) {{and steel}} furnace slag (SFS) are {{granular}} waste by-products {{that result from}} {{the operation of the}} coal mining and the steel industries, respectively. Their effective reuse and recycling as fill materials for earthwork construction, embankments and/or structural <b>fill</b> materials in <b>port</b> expansion projects, is economically attractive and environmentally sustainable because it lessens the need for disposal and sourcing of materials from local quarries. As the need for blending these materials arises from their individual adverse geotechnical characteristics, i. e. swelling and breakage behaviour in SFS and CW, it is important to evaluate the suitability of different mixtures ratios particularly in terms of shear strength and swelling potential to meet various performance criteria for structural fills. This paper presents an experimental study on the compacted SFS and CW source materials and SFS-CW blends prepared on a dry weight basis. First the basic index properties of the mixtures are described and the shear strength and swelling behaviour were examined through drained triaxial compression and free swelling tests according to the expected performance criteria of structural <b>fill</b> materials for <b>port</b> reclamation. The experimental data suggests that while different blends exhibited different stress strain behaviour, they showed some degree of similarity in terms of the stress-strain relationships.
