The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{temperature}} and two windchill indices with respect to the strength of their association with daily variation in mortality in the Netherlands during 1979 to 1987. The two windchill indices were those developed by Siple and Passel and by Steadman. METHODS. Daily numbers of cause-specific deaths were related to the meteorological variables by means of Poisson regression with control for influenza incidence. Lag times were taken into account. RESULTS. Daily variation in mortality, especially mortality from heart disease, was more strongly related to the Steadman windchill index than to temperature or the Siple and Passel index (34. 9 %, 31. 2 %, and 31. 5 %, respectively, of mortality variation explained). The strongest relation was found with <b>daytime</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the Steadman index. CONCLUSIONS. In areas where spells of cold are frequently accompanied by strong wind, the use of the Steadman index probably adds much to the identification of weather conditions involving an increased risk of death. The results of this study provide no justification for the wide-spread use (e. g., in the United States) of the Siple and Passel inde...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is {{the main}} cause of morbidity, {{disability}} and mortality in the adult population in most countries of the world. Aim. Aiming to establish the features of 24 -hour monitoring of blood pressure, serum urotensin II and angiotensin II concentrations, vascular remodeling and extracranial blood flow in patients with stage II hypertension associated with carotid atherosclerosis, cerebral blood flow indexes were studied in 102 patients using duplex scanning of extracranial arteries, 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring. Serum urotensin II and angiotensin II levels were determined with immunoenzymatic method. Results. It was found that the average 24 -hour, average <b>daytime</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> systolic and diastolic blood pressure, variability indicators and blood pressure load were significantly higher in the patients of the first group of observation. Among cerebral blood flow indexes, statistically significant differences were showed by linear blood flow velocity, intima-media thickness, RI and PI. The patients with stage II hypertension associated with extracranial arterial lesions had probably higher serum urotensin II concentrations. Conclusion. This indicates higher levels of 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring indexes, severe disorders of cerebral blood flow and neurohormonal activation in case of simultaneous hypertension and atherosclerotic lesion of brachiocephalic arteries. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present {{observations}} <b>of</b> {{unusually high}} <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and N 2 O {{in the middle}} stratosphere that were observed by the airborne submillimeter radiometer ASUR in the Arctic. The observations {{took place in the}} meteorological situation of a major stratospheric warming that occurred in mid-January 2003 and was dominated by a wave 2 event. On 23 January 2003 the observed N 2 O and O 3 mixing ratios around 69 ¬∞ N in the middle stratosphere reached maximum <b>values</b> <b>of</b> ~ 190 ppb and ~ 10 ppm, respectively. The similarities of these N 2 O profiles in a potential temperature range between 800 and 1200 K with N 2 O observations around 20 ¬∞ N on 1 March 2003 by the same instrument suggest that the observed Arctic airmasses were transported from the tropics by isentropic transport. Using a linearized ozone chemistry model along idealized trajectories at different altitudes transport times between about 3 and 7 days are estimated from the difference between the Arctic and tropical O 3 mixing ratios observed in this potential temperature range. PV distributions suggest that these airmasses did not stay confined in the Arctic region which makes it unlikely that this dynamical situation lead to the formation of dynamically caused pockets <b>of</b> low <b>ozone...</b>|$|R
40|$|HVAC filters have a {{significant}} influence on indoor air quality. In addition to removing particulate contaminants, filters accumulate a particle layer that can react with ozone. Ozone-particle cake reactions serve as a sink for ozone {{and a source of}} secondary carbonyls. The location of filters in air distribution systems can lead to byproducts being distributed throughout a building. Two experiments were performed to determine the ozone removal efficiency on two residential filters that were loaded with particles for one month (# 1) and three months (# 2). On both filters, the ozone removal efficiency dropped rapidly during the first 30 minutes and then stayed approximately constant for 4 hours. The steady state <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> removal efficiency were 10 % for Filter # 1 and 14 % for Filter # 2 at a face velocity of 0. 81 cm/s. The potential for HVAC filters to affect ozone concentrations in residential buildings was evaluated using a well-mixed reactor model. The tested filters reduced indoor ozone levels slightly when compared to indoor surfaces and an entire HVAC system, although the impact was much smaller than that of the air exchange rate. The influence of continuous particle deposition was not considered here, but would likely increase the impact <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> interactions on HVAC filters...|$|R
