500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to <b>do</b> <b>really</b> ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{days before}} the film's premiere, the Church of Scientology took out full-page {{advertisements}} in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear, comparing it to the story [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] published by Rolling Stone magazine. Gibney subsequently {{said that he was}} grateful for the church's advertising, as it had attracted much publicity for the film; he only wished [...] "they'd put in showtimes". The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that when she saw the adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: [...] "Docs don’t get full page ads, and when they do, they <b>do</b> <b>really</b> well." ...|$|E
500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work. She said the episode shows [...] "the ludicrous nature of, you know, {{what we do}} in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, you see them <b>do</b> <b>really</b> stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E

500|$|Actor George Clooney {{provided}} the small {{role of the}} voice of Sparky, which is limited entirely to dog barks. Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone {{that served as a}} precursor to South Park. Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them <b>do</b> <b>really</b> minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E
500|$|Katamari Damacy is a third-person puzzle-action {{video game}} that was {{published}} and developed by Namco for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The music in the game was widely hailed as imaginative and original, and {{was considered one of}} its top selling points. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences. The tracks were composed by multiple composers, with Yuu Miyake composing the most at seven and acting as the sound director; other composers for the game were Asuka Sakai, Akitaka Tohyama, Yoshihito Yano, Yuri Misumi, and Hideki Tobeta. Many of the tracks feature vocals from popular J-pop singers such as Yui Asaka and anime voice actors such as Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. Miyake has stated that they chose the artists by looking for [...] "Japanese singers who were well-known in Japan but nobody had heard from [...] for whatever reason". Miyake wanted to use vocal songs because he felt that they were necessary [...] "to make music that only Katamari Damacy could <b>do,</b> <b>really</b> fun music". He has said that game director Keita Takahashi did not give detailed directions on the sound design of the game, allowing Miyake and his team to instead create whatever they felt would fit best.|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could <b>do</b> <b>really</b> well, but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order is {{the second}} game to use id Software's id Tech 5 engine, after Rage (2011). The game {{utilizes}} the engine to add {{a large amount of}} detail to the game world. The team often found it difficult to develop the game with 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, particularly on complex environments, but [...] "we always made it work somehow", said Matthies. He has also said that the main advantages of the engine is the speed and the detailing, while its biggest disadvantage is dynamic lighting; [...] "on the other hand the static light rendering is really awesome, so you have full radiosity and can <b>do</b> <b>really</b> spectacular-looking things using that," [...] he added. Senior concept artist Axel Torvenius said that one of the main inspirations for the art design of the game was movies from the 1960s, calling out the James Bond movies. The design for the Nazis in the game was influenced by the aesthetics of the Nazis {{at the end of the}} Second World War; [...] "it's blended with the style of the 1960s and the fashion ideals of how to express yourself visually," [...] Öjerfors explained. This viewpoint is also influenced by the element of exaggeration, which is common throughout the game's design and has been acknowledged by the team as a development inspiration. Character models can be covered in up to a 256k texture; however, this is not used often in the game on individual characters, due to the difficulty of seeing it from a distance.|$|E

Reinhard Genzel, team leader of the research, said the study has delivered [...] "what is now {{considered to be the}} best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes <b>do</b> <b>really</b> exist.

And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout November 2009, Pierre {{undertook}} a promotional tour called On the Dino Trail. Along with the band's tour manager and a friend, Pierre made appearances and played acoustic shows throughout the US Midwest and East Coast. The tour's itinerary was planned with fans' help through Twitter, {{with it all}} being chronicled online at MyDinosaurLife.com. The guitarist Joshua Cain commented that he felt their use of Twitter had helped to reconnect the band with fans. [...] "I feel like {{in the last few}} years, that stuff's gotten harder to <b>do...</b> <b>really</b> re-engaged us as a band to be able to communicate with everybody." [...] The band played three sold-out Chicago shows in mid-December, each of which featured one of the band's previous records in full. They then arranged a touring schedule which would include supporting Weezer on several dates in December and January, as well as beginning a headlining tour in late January covering the United States. Following the album's release, they recommenced touring; {{in the first three months}} the band travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the United Kingdom.|$|E

[...] All About Soap said they were [...] "very excited" [...] that Shirley's family were being introduced and taking over The Queen Victoria. Inside Soap Kate White said she [...] "can't wait to see the impant the Carters have on their new manor, as well as seeing Danny in action behind that bar." [...] Rosie Gizauskas from Now said Dyer's casting was [...] "the best idea ever", adding, [...] "this will totally work. I literally can't wait to see original East End geezer Danny in [...] his spiritual home. [...] This was meant to be." [...] Yahoo! TV UK said that Dyer joining EastEnders would be [...] "interesting" [...] because he [...] "tends to divide viewers into those who think he's a ridiculous posturing fool and those who think he's a ridiculous posturing fool who can also act." [...] Ben Dowell from the Radio Times thought the description of Mick sounded like comedian Al Murray's Pub Landlord character. Former EastEnders cast member Scott Maslen, who played Jack Branning, said of Dyer's casting in the show: [...] "He will go there, give a bit of banter and he will embrace it, but it'll be a challenge for him.
