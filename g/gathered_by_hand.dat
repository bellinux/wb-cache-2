25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops them up with the rake or tongs.|$|E
2500|$|Blooming is {{the time}} when coffee plants bloom with white flowers which last for about 3–4 days (termed [...] "evanescent" [...] period) before they mature into seeds. When coffee {{plantations}} are in full bloom it is a delightful sight to watch. The time period between blooming and maturing of the fruit varies appreciably with the variety and the climate; for the Arabica, it is about seven months, and for the Robusta, about nine months. The fruit is <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> when it is fully ripe and red-purple in colour.|$|E
50|$|Each camel {{can produce}} around five pounds (2.25 kg) of hair a year. Hair may be {{collected}} by shearing, combing or by collecting fiber shed naturally during the six to eight-week molting season in late spring. Fallen hair is normally <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{implements}} the Quota Management System (QMS) {{to limit}} catches {{of fish and}} shellfish. Under QMS, a limit of 2807364 kg for the rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, and 1291000 kg for the New Zealand scampi, Metanephrops challengeri, were in place in 2011. Recreational fishers may only <b>gather</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> or use lobster pots, while commercial fishers catch lobsters by trawling. The total catch in 2011 was 2539946 kg of J. edwardsii, 350194 kg of M. challengeri, and 23086 kg of Sagmariasus verreauxi.|$|R

This limited attention for work on empirical learning of language knowledge and behaviour from text and speech data seems unjusti ed. After all, it is becoming apparent that empirical learning of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can alleviate NLP's all-time main problem, viz. the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: empirical ML methods such as rule induction, top down induction of decision trees, lazy learning, inductive logic programming, and some types of neural network learning, seem to be excellently suited to automatically induce exactly that knowledge {{that is hard to}} <b>gather</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> In this paper we address the question why NLP is an interesting application for empirical ML, and provide a brief overview of current work in this area. 1 Empirical Learning of Natural Language Looking at the ML literature of the last decade, it is clear that language {{learning has}} not been an important application area of ML techniques.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to mistake other distasteful or toxic species of mushrooms for candy caps or mistakenly include in such species in a larger collection of candy caps. Those inexperienced with mushroom identification may mistake any number of little brown mushrooms ("LBMs") for candy caps, including the deadly galerina (Galerina marginata and allies), which can occur in the same habitat. Candy caps can be distinguished from non-Lactarius species by their brittle stipe, while most other [...] "LBMs" [...] have a more flexible stipe. It is therefore recommended that candy caps be <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> breaking the fragile stipe in ones fingers. By this method, LBM's with a cartilaginous stipe will easily be distinguished.|$|E

50|$|Mussels are <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> from Carmarthen Bay and {{are best}} in the winter time, {{when there is an}} ‘R’ in the month. September to April is the {{traditional}} mussel (and oyster) season. Cockles are gathered in the Burry Inlet, but mainly on the Gower side (see Cuisine of Gower). However, Les Parsons, a native Laugharne, returned home after having served in India in 1947 and started his own shellfish business on the Carmarthenshire side of the estuary. This was around the time that Dylan Thomas was resident, and writing about the “web-footed cocklewomen of Laugharne”. Les Parson experimented with bottling cockles in vinegar, to enable them to be sold further afield, and established Parson’s Pickles. The firm uses Laugharne Castle as part of its corporate identity because the original factory was located in a mill close to the castle. The company now operates out of Burry Port and produces cockles, mussels, shellfish and pickles, to traditional recipes and European Union accreditation standards.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1970s {{there was}} a {{commercial}} watercress industry, run by the now-defunct Greatford Gardens Watercress Company, using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In some years, the bores became naturally flowing artesian wells when pressure was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface {{without the aid of}} pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress. Some remnants of this industry can be found {{to the west of the}} old sluice gates, approximately eight hundred yards south of the Haven Inn. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the Beck approximately fifty yards to the east of the Clew Gates. The watercress was <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as chips and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at New Holland for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar watercress farms at Healing, Lincolnshire, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Fordingbridge, Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in Barrow Haven when it lost its water rights.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{computing}} {{and interactions}} {{have become increasingly}} complex over the last decade, resulting in an online ecosystem with many more options for users, but less transparent information about their security and, in particular, their privacy. The resulting gap between security and functionality {{has given rise to}} various problems and concerns. While these problems e. g., the spread of malware, data breaches on (supposedly) secure servers, mining of private user data on social networks dash might seem quite diverse, many of them revolve around the broader issue of what happens to systems when they get deployed. Systems that may have seemed fully secure in development often fail to fulfill these security goals in the real world, as adversaries may have capabilities that were not taken into account when the system was designed, and even honest users may interact with the system in unexpected ways. In this dissertation, I describe two areas in which this gap between the abstract protocol and the deployed system leads to security concerns that ultimately impact every user of the system. The first area considers what happens when adversaries have unexpected capabilities; in particular, we examine how to model sophisticated attacks on the security of a system, such as side channels and fault injection, and then how to design flexible cryptosystems that can tolerate such attacks. The second area considers the more benign scenario in which users, purely by virtue of their own decisions, may unknowingly cede some of their own privacy. In particular, we examine user anonymity in the Bitcoin network, which is a purely virtual currency that acts as an electronic version of cash. By combining publicly available information with minimal data <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> we find that an average Bitcoin user is experiencing a fairly low level of anonymity, making Bitcoin ultimately unattractive for criminal activity such as money launderin...|$|E
