40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two papers dealing with fertility in Sweden. In paper [1] we discuss possible explanations for the variation in the Swedish fertility. We are primarily interested in economic and social conditions {{and their impact on}} the total fertility rate between 1965 and 2003. The period is chosen because of (i) the strong fluctuation in the TFR during the period 1965 - 2003 and (ii) the positive correlation between fertility and the female labour market participation rate from the early 1980 s. This contrasts to earlier periods when the negative relationship was prevalent. The results from the study support a positive effect on fertility from female labour market participation and child allowance while divorces report a negative effect. The model structure that includes short run as well as long run effects seems to be the best specified model of a number of different model structures presented in the paper. Contrary to the first paper, the second paper [2] has as starting point the number of children born by women in Sweden. A zero inflated Poisson model is applied to analyse if economic and social conditions have any impact on the number of children born by women in Sweden. The study is based upon women who have completed their life-time fertility cycle. The different variables on completed fertility is compared with women who still are in their fertile ages. The results show a difficulty to combine market work and children. The results also support the assumption that women with higher education have fewer children than women with lower education. However, an important conclusion from the study is that the negative correlation between a woman's level of education and her number of children only hold when <b>incomplete</b> <b>fertility</b> is analysed. The relationship between female education and children is not valid when completed fertility is studied.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} first wave of HILDA in an {{analysis}} of the determinants of fertility, focusing in particular on the role of education. Estimating lifetime fertility from micro data sets is generally quite difficult since {{a large proportion of the}} sample, because of their age, will have <b>incomplete</b> <b>fertility.</b> The HILDA survey allows this problem to be addressed, however, because as well as measuring the actual number of children a person has, there is also information on the additional number of children a person expects to parent. Thus it is possible to estimate the determinants of fertility in three dimensions: the actual number of children a person has, the expected future number of children, and total intended lifetime fertility, the sum of the first two. The analysis is conducted in several stages. First, total intended lifetime fertility is modelled as a function of education and a host of other variables reflecting the opportunity costs and consumption elements of child rearing. The HILDA sample allows control for a host of other factors, reflecting both attitudes and values, and their roles are examined as well. The main result is that education lowers total lifetime fertility, although the strength of this relationship falls importantly with the addition of a range of variables, such as marital history and equivalised household income. A second set of estimations concerns the determinants of the expected future number of children, controlling for the number of children a person already has. The estimations reveal that more educated people tend to have significantly higher fertility expectations than others, and that the effect is non-linear. The juxtaposition of the results of the two approaches could be interpreted to mean that higher education per se does not lower people’s fertility expectation while the more educated tend to defer their fertility and may end up with fewer children due to some unexpected constraints such as deterioration or breakdown in relationship and fecundity problems at later stage. Realising these risks before hand along with appropriate institutional and financial supports from the government may help the educated people to achieve their fertility expectation. In addition to education, all fertility measures are influenced importantly by, among others: household income (negative for the first and positive for the second); partnering (positive); the significance of religion in people’s lives (positive); and values concerning motherhood (positive). Many different specifications were explored with the main conclusions being robust. It is recognised, however, that fertility decisions are likely to be made in combination with a host of other life-cycle issues, such as investment in education, and that the results of the estimations need to be qualified by this reality.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple age-period-cohort framework in completing <b>incomplete</b> cohort <b>fertility</b> schedules, and makes {{full use of}} 1917 [...] 2005 U. S. data to obtain robust outcomes. Empirically, we indicate that the period effect {{is the key to}} transforming a fertility level into a fertility schedule. Accompanied by the smoothed version of tempo-variance-adjusted total fertility rates proposed in Kohler and Philipov (2001), we approximate the cohort fertility schedules fairly well and the estimates of all distributional parameters can be thereby obtained. Our approach is easy to implement and the data requirement is relatively light, indicating that the proposed method is readily applicable to countries whose data lengths are insufficiently long, and would be helpful for further empirical investigation of the relationship between cohort fertility behavior and other cohort-specific socioeconomic factors.

40|$|In this study, 12 T-DNA {{insertion}} mutant {{lines were}} selected by their distinct phenotypes in grain development such as sterile, low fertility, abnormal panicles and grains. Only six of these mutants could get flanking sequence by TAIL PCR and plasmid rescue. Among them, only mutants M 0023454 and M 0039314 showed single insertion event without changes of Tos 17 number in their genomes. They {{were selected for}} further study. In mutant M 0023454, the T-DNA was inserted in the BAC clone of OSJNBa 0039 C 07 in the rice chromosome number 4. This mutant showed more susceptible to the pathogen, and this phenotype was co-segregated with the genotype. The expression of gene 454 - 10, 987 bp upstream of T-DNA insertion site, was activated in mutant while no expression was detected in TNG 67. Gene 454 - 10, encode an AP 2 domain, is belong to the AP 2 /ERF family and much more similar to ERFBP group, which involved in pathogen resistant pathway. This study suggests that the susceptible phenotype to pathogen in mutant M 0023454 {{may be due to}} the overexpression of gene 454 - 10. In mutant M 0039314, the T-DNA was inserted in the PAC clone of P 0702 E 04 in the rice chromosome number 8. Mutant M 0039314 showed abnormal phenotypes, such as dark green leaves, irradiative tillers, low <b>fertility,</b> <b>incomplete</b> seed development, weaker anthers and reduced length of panicle and peduncle. Almost all of these abnormal phenotypes were co-segregated with the genotypes. The expression of gene 314 - 5 and 314 - 6, flanked at both side of T-DNA inserted site, were activated in mutant M 0039314 while no expression was detected in TNG 67. Gene 314 - 5 encodes a putative transcription factor, SBP, and expressed weakly in all vegetative tissues but strongly in the reproductive tissues in TNG 67. Gene 314 - 6, an OsMADS 45 gene, has been published and showed mainly expressed in the reproductive tissues in TNG 67. The results of this study suggest that the abnormal phenotypes in mutant M 0039314 {{may be due to the}} overexpression of gene 314 - 5 and 314 - 6. In order to confirm the abnormal phenotypes of M 0023454 and M 0039314 are really caused by the overexpression of 454 - 10, 314 - 5 and 314 - 6 and to find out the exact function of these genes, the transgenic lines with overexpression of these genes will be created. 本研究自田間約 6, 000 株的T-DNA插入突變株中，篩選穀粒完全不稔實、稔實率較低、穗發育特異或榖粒外型特異等與水稻榖粒發育相關的突變株，共 12 株系。利用質體救援或Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR的方法，共六突變株獲得T-DNA所插入鄰近序列，由南方墨點法結果顯示其中M 0023454 及M 0039314 兩株突變株為單一T-DNA插入所致。進一步分析其後代的基因型與農藝性狀間的遺傳模式，發現有共分離的現象。M 0023454 突變株具有易遭病菌感染的特性，其中T-DNA插入於水稻第 4 對染色體OSJNBa 0039 C 07 BAC上之 113711 bp位置，經由逆轉錄酶連鎖反應分析，T-DNA的插入，可活化插入點上游 987 bp處編號 454 - 10 基因的表現量。經分析發現， 454 - 10 在葉及種子發育過程中有微量的表現，而在 5 天的根部組織及誘導 15 天的癒傷組織中有大量的表現。經胺基酸比對分析， 454 - 10 蛋白內含有AP 2 活性區域，歸類在AP 2 /ERF家族基因中的ERF類，主要參與調控抵抗病菌入侵的生理反應，與阿拉伯芥中的RAP 2. 6 最相似。因此推測 454 - 10 的大量表現可能造成植株抵抗病菌能力產生變異。M 0039314 突變株具有：稻桿外擴、穗型直立、花梗及穗長較短、花藥發育異常、稔實率低及種子發育不完全等特異的農藝性狀；其中T-DNA插入於水稻第 8 對染色體編號P 0702 E 04 PAC的 48951 bp的位置，經由逆轉錄酶連鎖反應分析，T-DNA的插入，可活化上游 314 - 5 及下游 314 - 6 兩個基因的表現量。經分析發現， 314 - 5 在營養生長組織有持續微弱的表現，在生殖生長組織中則有大量的表現，而 314 - 6 在生殖生長組織中偵測到大量表現。進一步將 314 - 5 及 314 - 6 的胺基酸序列進行比對分析， 314 - 5 蛋白含有一個植物特有且具轉錄因子特性的SBP活性區域； 314 - 6 則為水稻中已發表的OsMADS 45 。由M 0039314 突變株的農藝性狀，推測 314 - 5 及 314 - 6 的大量表現可能會影響穗、花器及種子的型態。M 0023454 及M 0039314 突變株所觀察到之特異農藝性狀是否確實因為 454 - 10 或 314 - 5 、 314 - 6 基因活化大量表現所導致，仍須進一步針對回復株作探討。英文摘要………………………………………………………………………………. i 中文摘要………………………………………… [...] . …………………………………. ii 目錄………………………………………… [...] . ………………………………………iii 圖表目錄………………………………………… [...] . …………………………………. v 縮字對照表…………………………………………………………………… [...] . … [...] vii 前言………………………………………… [...] . ………………………………………. 1 前人研究 水稻基因功能的研究…………………………………………. ……………… [...] . 1 	水稻T-DNA突變體庫………………………………………… [...] . ……………… 2 	MADS box基因及水稻OsMADS 45 ………………………………………… [...] 3 	AP 2 /ERF family………………………………………… [...] . …………………… [...] 5 	SBP-box genes (Squamosa promoter binding protein) …………………………. 7 材料………………………………………… [...] . …………………………………… [...] . 11 方法 一、T-DNA插入點鄰近序列之分析…………………………………… [...] …… 12 二、南方墨點法………………………………………… [...] . …………………… 14 三、基因表現偵測…………………………………… [...] . ………………………. 15 四、抗體製備………………………………………… [...] . ……………………… 15 五、蛋白質表現之分析…………………………………… [...] . …………………. 18 結果 一、T-DNA插入突變株篩選及初步分析…………………… [...] . ……………… [...] 21 1. 	本研究篩選過之T-DNA插入突變株之農藝性狀……………………. 21 2. 	分析突變株之T-DNA插入事件…………………… [...] . ……………… [...] 22 3.
