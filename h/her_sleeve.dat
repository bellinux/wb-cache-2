25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> as proof.|$|E
500|$|According to GameSpy's {{guide to}} Deception, Mileena [...] "has some solid {{offensive}} tools" [...] and [...] "a few solid combos up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{as well as}} a few pop-up attacks that are extremely quick and open up brief juggle opportunities," [...] but also severe weaknesses such as a very short range of her sai and poor ranged attack abilities. Prima Games' official guide for Armageddon gave Mileena an overall rating of 6/10, calling her a [...] "punisher" [...] type character and a better fighter than Kitana ("seems to have the upper hand between the two"), but while she [...] "is able to punish from any range and even interrupt high attacks and projectiles, the damage she inflicts is minor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Did It Again" [...] was {{recorded}} at Real World, Sarm West and DMC Studios in England, and was mixed by Alan Bremnar at Real World. Greg Bone and Anderson played the guitars, while Anderson played the drums and keyboards. Produced by Brothers in Rhythm and Minogue, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a pop rock song. Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine commented on Minogue's departure from dance music and bubblegum pop and her maturity since {{her work with}} Stock, Aitken and Waterman, stating [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> this time than Stock, Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow." [...] British writer Sean Smith, author of Kylie (2014), commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was another track, along with [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", from Impossible Princess that [...] "didn't really sound like Kylie". He further commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was [...] "a blend of drums and electric guitar that might have found its way onto The Beatles' famous Revolver album." [...] Reviewing her compilation album Greatest Hits 87–97 (2003), Michael Paoletta from Billboard magazine viewed the composition as progressive rock.|$|E

500|$|... 3 Splash {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris True from AllMusic highlighted Hashire! {{as a career}} stand out track from Kumi's discography. Ian Martin from the same publication reviewed [...] "Lick Me" [...] and [...] "Ecstasy" [...] from the Universe album and was divided. For [...] "Lick Me", he said, [...] "She wears her sexuality on <b>her</b> <b>sleeve,</b> with song titles like [...] "Lick Me" [...] laying their erotic playing {{cards on the table}} from the get-go, and her lack of any recognizable singing ability compensated for by an awful lot of gumption." [...] For [...] "Ecstasy", he commended her [...] "hard working ethic" [...] in many songs, highlighting the song and concluded that, [...] "All of this reveals a desperate need to achieve success no matter what, but also the humanity of the effort underpinning it." [...] Greenberg commended the production of [...] "Ecstasy", and said that [...] "Lick Me" [...] was [...] "slightly off-tempo" [...] that [...] "brings Kumi back to more standard territory." [...] A reviewer from CD Journal complimented the production of each song, and described the EP as [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "danceable". Hiraga Tetsuo from Hot Express was positive, who commended Kumi's song writing and the [...] "summer" [...] theme throughout the EP.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Allmusic's Chris True had {{selected}} the song as an album stand {{out and a}} career stand out track. While reviewing her 2002 compilation Confide in Me, True stated “Impossible Princess, both of which found her stretching and growing beyond the pop princess image she had previously. Dark, noisy tracks like [...] "Limbo," [...] the trip-hoppy [...] "Jump," [...] and the more rock-oriented [...] "I Don't Need Anyone" [...] and [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"—both of which were co-written by the Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield—found her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past.” A reviewer from Who Magazine called the song [...] "Funky , Spunky, Rocky, Big." [...] Gareth Gorman {{said that while the}} song showcased Minogue's [...] "thin vocals", he followed saying [...] "it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning, simple and effective." [...] Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine stated [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> this time that Stock, Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow." [...] A reviewer from Music Week awarded the song four stars out of five, stating [...] "Kylie changes musical tack again with this dense, big sounding single, co-written with two of the Manics, which loudly announces she's back in style." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone named [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as {{the third}} best song of 2011. The writer concluded, [...] "Brit {{delivers}} the Apocalypse Now of Eurotrash electrotrance disco songs, as that throbbing pulse builds to a pure drop-the-bomb chorus. And that 'whoa-ho-ho' choir sounds like Cher leading an aircraft carrier full of gay sailors." [...] The song was also named {{as the third}} best single of 2011 by Billboard, and commented that it is [...] "Britney's most immediate single since 'Toxic'." [...] Sam Lansky of PopCrush considered [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] the best pop song of 2011, writing, [...] "2011 was already Year of the Spears by January, when Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' topped the charts — but [...] had something even better up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve,</b> the crackling dancefloor barnstormer 'Till the World Ends,' penned by rowdy popstrel Kesha and produced by monster hitmaker Dr. Luke. It's a gargantuan party song with provocative lyrics (“This kitten got your tongue tied in knots,” anyone?), throbbing synths, and a thrillingly euphoric hands-in-the-air chant-along chorus — and there wasn't a more exuberant pop song this year." [...] Digital Spy also considered the track as the best song of 2011, naming it [...] "Britney's best track since 'Toxic'" [...] and commenting, [...] "judging from its chart position, it's also her most underrated hit." [...] The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as the seventh best song of 2011, tied with Lana Del Rey's [...] "Video Games". [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was voted by readers as the Best Song of the 2010s on Billboard.|$|E

500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing and that made me overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{positive}} {{and focused on the}} novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "A burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds. The convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes no good for him. But somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him, when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement, and the reason for all this melee, in which the whole countryside took part, becomes apparent." [...] The requirement that the fleeing [...] "convict" [...] be continually assisted {{as a part of the}} plot may have been lost on The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer. The reviewer writes, [...] "Perhaps, in real life, things might not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage, the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him. Even then, Fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve.</b> In the film, at any rate, everybody bit nicely. They pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising. There they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and, no doubt, enjoyed it hugely. They did if it was as good as the film is. The least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials; but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News identified the set up and assistance to [...] "the convict" [...] and states,"In spite of the Thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume, not used in this state for some two years, the audience did not 'catch on.' When the revelation came, at the door of the New Rochelle picture show, the theatre rang with laughter. We were all 'stung' and we enjoyed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1914, Joplin and Lottie self-published his [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] as the Scott Joplin Music Company, {{which he}} had formed the {{previous}} December. Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due to syphilis and was [...] "...consciously racing against time." [...] In <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> notes on the 1992 Deutsche Grammophon release of Treemonisha she notes that he [...] "...plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera, day and night, with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts, page by page, as each page of the full score was completed." ...|$|E

They are destroyed when, in [...] "The Witch's Familiar", to avoid being killed by Daleks, they channel energy from the Daleks' weapons to teleport them away, looking {{as if they were}} exterminated. In the same episode, Missy says her brooch contains a Gallifreyan Dark Star alloy pin, given to her by The Doctor [...] "when my daughter...", which she uses to pierce a Dalek's armoured shell. In [...] "The Doctor Falls", Missy uses a small blade concealed in <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> to stab her own past self, triggering his off-screen regeneration.|$|E

Sam’s a colourful and fun character as she’s had such a past." [...] She added in 2003, [...] "She wears her heart on <b>her</b> <b>sleeve.</b> She so wants to settle down that she doesn't select men well. She goes for people too quickly. She likes the danger aspect — the thrill of the chase. She loves guys with a dangerous edge [...] She's had a tough upbringing. She didn't know her dad and her older brothers bossed her around. She needed to find herself and has done it by being independent and going away. She's headstrong and has a definite independent streak." [...] She has added that Sam has a problem with women, as she [...] "finds it quite hard to relate".|$|E
2500|$|During the war, most Germans saw Britain as {{the main}} enemy, and so Chamberlain's status as the Englishman who {{supported}} the Reich made him an even more famous celebrity in Germany {{than he had been}} before 1914. Chamberlain's wartime essays were widely read. The first set of essays sold 160,000 copies within six months of publication while the second set sold 75,000 copies within six weeks of publication. Between 1914 and 1918 about 1 million copies of Chamberlain's essays were sold, making Chamberlain one of Germany's best read writers during the war. In December 1915, it was estimated that between the direct sales of Chamberlain's essays and reprints in newspapers that at least 3 million people had read Chamberlain's war-time writings. Such was the power of Chamberlain as a public figure that in August 1916 the German Jewish industrialist Walther Rathenau-whom Chamberlain had often accused of profiteering-mailed Chamberlain a copy of his bank balance sheets which showed that Rathenau was in fact getting poorer {{as a result of the}} war, and politely asked Chamberlain to stop accusing him of war profiteering. Rathenau's appeal made no impression and Chamberlain continued to accuse Rathenau of war profiteering right until he was assassinated in 1922. In 1917 Chamberlain wrote about the liberal Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper: [...] "No knowledgeable person, can doubt that the enemy is at work among us...whenever England has something up <b>her</b> <b>sleeve</b> against the interests of Germany, she uses the Frankfurter Zeitung". Bernhard Guttmann, the editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung sued Chamberlain for libel about that article. In August 1918, the sensational libel trial which attracted much media attention opened. The Frankfurter Zeitungs lawyers were Conrad Haussmann and Hertz while Chamberlain was defended by Heinrich Class and Adolf Jacobsen. On 16 August 1918, the trial ended with the judge ruling that Chamberlain was indeed guilty of libel and fined him 1,500 marks. The guilty verdict set off a storm in right-wing circles, who quickly held several successful fund-raisers that raised the necessary 1,500 marks to pay Chamberlain's fine.|$|E
