25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
500|$|According to Jane O'Grady, Williams {{was central}} to the {{decision}} by King's in 1972 to admit women, one of three all-male undergraduate colleges to do so that year. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum's thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: [...] "ou <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> price you are paying for this support and encouragement. Your dignity is being held hostage. You really don't {{have to put up}} with this." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Test {{series against}} Pakistan, Trescothick {{was offered the}} {{captaincy}} once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as [...] "unofficial second in command...I believe {{it was the right}} thing to step up. It is exciting to think I could be in charge for a few weeks...I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> chance I maybe won't be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I've seen the things it [...] does to you." [...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E

2500|$|Living donor {{surgery is}} done {{at a major}} center. Very few {{individuals}} require any blood transfusions during or after surgery. [...] All potential donors should <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of death. Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of blood clots and a prolonged recovery. The vast majority of donors enjoy complete and full recovery within 2–3 months.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1986, Bjelke-Petersen {{had pushed}} for {{approval}} of {{construction of the}} world's tallest skyscraper in the Brisbane CBD, which had been announced in May. The project, which had not {{been approved by the}} Brisbane City Council, enraged his backbenchers. During a party meeting, MP Huan Fraser confronted Bjelke-Petersen, saying [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bloody big payoff to you coming as a result of this. You're a corrupt old bastard, and I'm not going to cop it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Melanomas (choroidal, {{ciliary body}} and uveal) - [...] In {{the early stages}} {{there may be no}} {{symptoms}} (the person does not <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tumor until an ophthalmologist or optometrist looks into the eye with an ophthalmoscope during a routine test). As the tumor grows, symptoms can be blurred vision, decreased vision, double vision, eventual vision loss and if they continue to grow the tumor can break past the retina causing retinal detachment. Sometimes the tumor can be visible through the pupil.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Luther {{taught that}} {{whatever}} a person places their trust or priorities in, other than God, {{can become an}} idol. Rather than scorn the Israelites for falling into the worship of idols, Luther commented that people are spiritual beings, who <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> divine authority and easily fall into idolatry because of our fallen nature. Knowing truth from idolatry, he explained, depends on the Bible, for without {{paying attention to the}} Word of God, people make up God’s characteristics to believe that God is in agreement [...] "with such works and worshippings as your devotion and good intention make choice of." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several sources {{speak of}} {{considerable}} involvement by the United States, Israel and Arab states, after Hamas in 2006 announced {{the formation of}} its own security service, the Executive Force, which was denounced by Mahmoud Abbas as unconstitutional. The Presidential Guard of Mahmoud Abbas was enlarged and equipped, and its members trained by the US, Egypt and Jordan. [...] Also, a PLC council member for Hamas, Anwar Zaboun, believes that ″Mohammed Dahlan had a big plan to remove the roots of Hamas, the resistance, in Gaza and the West Bank″.- ″In terms of the reconciliation, I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> veto from the United States of America and the European Union.

2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> degree of dissatisfaction among the public.

Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son said I should get out of EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oak Ridge was {{developed}} by the federal government as a segregated community as a requirement by the Southern bloc of Democrats in Congress to authorize funding for the project. Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built [...] "hutments" [...] (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. [...] Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Negro women sweeping the thirty-foot wide alley between the production units, and said [...] "Nichols, don't you <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?" [...] Nichols replied [...] "Sure I do, but these gals can do more than one of those machines". The men now had an opportunity to [...] "fracas" [...] on Saturday night, and labor turnover had reduced. During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses {{was developed}} in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.|$|E
