60|$|The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company started into {{existence}} one morning, not an Infant Institution, but a Grown-up Company running {{alone at a}} great pace, and doing business right and left: with a 'branch' in a first floor over a tailor's at the west-end of the town, and main offices in a new street in the City, comprising {{the upper part of}} a spacious house resplendent in stucco and plate-glass, with wire-blinds in all the windows, and 'Anglo-Bengalee' worked into the pattern of every one of them. On the doorpost was painted again in large letters, 'offices of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company,' and on the door was a large brass plate with the same inscription; always kept very bright, as courting inquiry; staring the City out of countenance after office hours on working days, and all day long on Sundays; and looking bolder than the Bank. Within, the offices were newly plastered, newly painted, newly papered, newly countered, newly floor-clothed, newly tabled, newly chaired, newly fitted up in every way, with goods that were substantial and expensive, and designed (like the company) to last. Business! Look at the green ledgers with red backs, like strong cricket-balls beaten flat; the court-guides directories, day-books, almanacks, letter-boxes, weighing-machines for letters, rows of fire-buckets for dashing out a conflagration in its first spark, and saving the immense wealth in notes and bonds belonging to the company; look at the iron safes, the clock, the office seal--in its capacious self, security for anything. Solidity! Look at the massive blocks of marble in the chimney-pieces, and the gorgeous parapet {{on the top of the}} house! Publicity! Why, Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance company is painted on the very coal-scuttles. It is repeated at every turn until the eyes are dazzled with it, and the head is giddy. It is engraved upon the top of all the letter paper, and it makes a scroll-work round the seal, and it shines out of the porter's buttons, and it is repeated twenty times in every circular and public notice wherein one David Crimple, Esquire, Secretary and resident Director, takes the liberty of inviting your attention to the accompanying statement of the advantages offered by the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company; and fully proves to you that any connection on your part with that establishment must result in a perpetual Christmas Box and constantly <b>increasing</b> <b>Bonus</b> to yourself, and that nobody can run any risk by the transaction except the office, which, in its great liberality is pretty sure to lose. And this, David Crimple, Esquire, submits to you (and the odds are heavy you believe him), is the best guarantee that can reasonably be suggested by the Board of Management for its permanence and stability.|$|E

According to recent studies, however, there are key differences in how pay-for-performance models influence federal employees in public service roles. James Perry is one scholar who has conducted such studies. His research reveals that public servants tend to be more intrinsically motivated, and thus, are prone to have a negative reaction to monetary incentives.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe surface warfare community has recently <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> amounts {{in an attempt}} to reward quality performance and retain superior officers. Simultaneously, the community has started to offer alternative programs and incentives that might appeal to those officers who desire a flexible career. We used survey information to determine which of these were the most appealing to the community in a way that might provide cost savings to the military when provided in conjunction with an auction bonus system. Using the standard bonus system compared to the uniform price auction, the Quality Adjusted Discount (QUAD) auction, and Combinatorial Retention Auction Mechanism (CRAM), we determined which would be most effective for maintaining quality officers in the community while meeting retention objectives and providing cost savings. We found that a quality auction system could provide cost savings as much as $ 1, 850, 000 or could increase costs by as much as $ 2, 081, 250, depending on community retention levels, even with <b>increased</b> individual <b>bonus</b> amounts. Additionally, from survey responses we were able to discern additional non-monetary incentives that surface warfare officers desire, which could be used to improve retention of quality officers in the future.

40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} {{contract}} between a principal and a liquidity-constrained agent in a stochastically repeated environment. The contract comprises a court-enforceable explicit bonus rule and an implicit fixed salary promise {{that must be}} self-enforcing. Since the agent’s rent <b>increases</b> with <b>bonus</b> pay, the principal implements the maximum credible salary promise. Thus, the <b>bonus</b> <b>increases</b> while the salary promise and the agent’s effort decrease with a higher probability of premature contract termination.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between discretionary accruals (DAs) and audit fees and whether this relationship is affected by the chief financial officer's (CFO) compensation structure. Design/methodology/approach – Using a large sample of cross-sectional firms over the period 2000 - 2006, multiple ordinary least square regression models are estimated. Findings – The paper finds that there is a positive and significant association between DAs and audit fees. Evidence shows that this relationship is significantly higher as CFO's <b>bonuses</b> <b>increase</b> and that this relationship is moderated as CFO's salaries increase. It is also found that income-increasing DAs are positively and significantly related with audit fees and that <b>increase</b> in CFO's <b>bonuses</b> signifies this positive relationship. Research limitations/implications – Results may change during the current financial crisis (i. e. 2007 -present) due to the increased regulatory scrutiny of executive compensation. Practical implications – The study has regulatory implications because of the recent calls to require a mandate regulating executive compensation practices. The results support these calls as data show that <b>increased</b> <b>bonuses</b> are associated with higher discretionary accruals and thus higher audit fees. There is also a call to limit executive compensation to fixed amounts and data support that increase in salaries moderates the positive association between discretionary accruals and audit fees. These results can also be used by independent auditors when assessing risks and thus the results have practical audit implications. Originality/value – The paper uses a large sample of public firms in years leading to the current financial crisis and contributes to the literature in executive compensation and audit practiceAuditor's fees, Bonuses, Chief executives, Remuneration, United States of America...|$|R
