5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their <b>digestive</b> <b>glands,</b> typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like <b>digestive</b> <b>glands.</b> Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the role of}} the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> in the respiratory metabolism of Penaeus setiferus adult males as a step toward proposing a feeding schedule based on the cycle of activity in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland.</b> We measured pre- and postprandial values for oxygen consumption rate and hemolymph glucose concentrations in live animals, and oxygen consumption rate and glycogen concentration in excised <b>digestive</b> <b>gland.</b> After the animals were fed, which enhanced general metabolic activity, these indices changed. There was a high correlation between the oxygen consumption rate of the animal and the glucose concentration in the hemolymph, and between the oxygen consumption rate by the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> and the glycogen concentration in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland,</b> all in relation to time after feeding. Correlations support the hypothesis that the energy demand depends upon the metabolic substrate concentration. In this theory, glucose sustains muscle activity (during ingestion of food) and glycogen is the product of the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> during food assimilation. Our observations of metabolic dynamics during the feeding period allowed us to examine the feeding process. The metabolic activity of the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> was highest 6 h after feeding. This could mean that assimilation, having started 2 h after food intake, peaked 6 h after feeding. Eight hours after feeding, the oxygen consumption rate of the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> decreased and fell to values similar to those recorded for animals subjected to 72 h of fasting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of the concentration of 8 essential and non essential heavy metals (Ag, Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Pb, V, Zn) in the tissues (<b>digestive</b> <b>gland,</b> cuttlebone and whole animal) of the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis collected in the Bay of Seine has been tracked {{since the end of}} the embryogenesis until the reproduction period. Compared to the embryos, the juveniles after hatchling display much higher concentrations of Ag, Cu, Fe and Zn suggesting an efficient incorporation from seawater. Conversely, the amounts of Cd, Pb and V in hatchlings remain suggesting that these metals are barely bioavailable for the juveniles. Once the juveniles start to feed, the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> appears to play a major role in the storage of all metals. After only one month of benthic life, the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> already contains up to 90 % of the total metal body burden, indicating that <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> plays a major role in the storage and presumed detoxification of the selected metals. Metal concentrations in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> increase in a logarithmic fashion with age during the entire life of cuttlefish, except for Ag which decreases as soon as cuttlefish migrate to open sea. This strongly suggests that (1) Ag is depurated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> in relation to supposedly lower exposure in less contaminated environments compare to coastal waters and (2) the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> of cephalopod could be a very good indicator of Ag contamination in the marine environment...|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) <b>digestive</b> <b>glands.</b> The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E

[...] Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum. Cells in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel.

2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, <b>digestive</b> <b>glands,</b> reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into <b>digestive</b> <b>glands,</b> renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E
