5|$|Disability sport's major {{classification}} body, the IPC, {{is working}} on improving classification {{to be more of}} an <b>evidence-based</b> system, as opposed to a performance-based system, so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class compared to competitors who train less.|$|E
5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to address these issues has been termed <b>evidence-based</b> medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E
5|$|Bahrain invests {{little in}} {{research}} and development. In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data {{on research and development}} poses a challenge for policy-makers, as data inform <b>evidence-based</b> policy-making.|$|E
5|$|Following the book's publication, Goldacre co-founded AllTrials with David Tovey, {{editor-in-chief}} of the Cochrane Library, together with the British Medical Journal, the Centre for <b>Evidence-based</b> Medicine, {{and others in the}} UK, and Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in the US. Set up in January 2013, the group campaigns for all past and current clinical trials to be registered and reported, for all treatments in use.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2016, IBM and Manipal Hospitals(a leading {{hospital}} {{chain in}} India), announced launch of IBM Watson for Oncology, for cancer patients. This product provides information and insights to physicians and cancer patients {{to help them}} identify personalized, <b>evidence-based</b> cancer care options. Manipal Hospitals is the second hospital {{in the world to}} adopt this technology and first in the world to offer it to patients online as an expert second opinion through their website.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of HHT remained a clinical one until the genetic defects that cause HHT {{were identified by}} a research group at Duke University Medical Center, in 1994 and 1996 respectively. In 2000, the international scientific advisory committee of HHT Foundation International published the now widely used Curaçao criteria. In 2006, a group of international experts met in Canada and formulated an <b>evidence-based</b> guideline, sponsored by the HHT Foundation International.|$|E
5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an <b>evidence-based</b> protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to <b>evidence-based</b> medicine.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an <b>evidence-based</b> classification system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Evidence-based</b> {{design and}} {{development}} {{decisions are made}} after reviewing information from repeated rigorous data gathering instead of relying on rules, single observations, or custom. <b>Evidence-based</b> medicine and <b>evidence-based</b> nursing practice are the two largest fields employing this approach. In psychiatry and community mental health, <b>evidence-based</b> practice guides have been created by such organizations as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, {{in conjunction with the}} National Alliance on Mental Illness. <b>Evidence-based</b> practice has now spread into a diverse range of areas outside of health where the same principles are known by names such as results-focused policy, managing for outcomes, evidence-informed practice etc.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{who choose}} to use {{homeopathy}} rather than <b>evidence-based</b> medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment of serious conditions such as cancer.|$|E
25|$|Crawford, and the {{decisions}} following it, also radically changed {{the handling of}} domestic violence cases by curtailing <b>evidence-based</b> prosecution, a common practice allowing the accused to be prosecuted without the participation of their accusers in the criminal court process. <b>Evidence-based</b> prosecution relies heavily on admission of statements under hearsay exceptions to reproduce the evidentiary effect of a victim testifying in court. The Crawford Court's decision renders most of these statements inadmissible without the accuser coming to court and testifying against the person {{he or she is}} accusing.|$|E
