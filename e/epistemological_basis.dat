The most important points of criticism are the following: First, it is reductionistic: Gruschka (2001) and Herzog (2010), for example, argue that the didactic triangle misses a lot of important aspects and is too simple for a holistic approach of teaching and learning. For example, it suggests that students can only learn when teachers teach them and it ignores the aspects of time, space, and interaction. Second, it is non-specific: Critical adherents of the idea argue that the idea of a triangle is also popular in rhetoric, communication science, media, and some other disciplines and contexts. So why should it be an extraordinary model for General Didactics? Third, it is not theoretically grounded: There is no theoretical background for the idea of a triangle. It is only a description of a situation, delivered over epochs and years without receiving an <b>epistemological</b> or scientific <b>basis.</b>|$|R

These were embedded in philosophical shifts, from the classical Greek ontologies through increasing pragmatism to formalism and logical positivism. Given that Goedel demonstrated the limitations of the latter as a foundation for mathematics, this essay explores phenomenology and Lakatosian ideas, which together offer a more sound <b>epistemological</b> and ontological <b>basis</b> for mathematics and a methodology for mathematical development. The question also then arises of the possible resurrection of earlier, neglected mathematical projects, including widening the domain of number theory to include integer qualities revealed in the growth of mathematics in general, which has predominantly been the growth of quantitative mathematics or logistike, the complement of arithmetike in classical Greece.

To resolve this, we offer an innovative explanation of the replication problem drawing on Foucault's concept of Episteme.

40|$|Evidence as {{a metaphor}} for {{knowledge}} characterised by the positivist traits of objectivity, validity and value-free truths is a contested commodity within the social science community, not least in the field of drugs research. The politics of knowledge production — including how research is produced, funded and interpreted through a lens clouded by values and ideology — is an ongoing topic for debate and enquiry. Nonetheless, the demand for objective data to inform evidence-based policy and practice, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of ‘what works’ and what is value for money, continues to grow exponentially. Research funders increasingly prioritise studies that have a demonstrable input into or impact on policy. The contributors to this book cast a critical gaze on the concept of evidence. They challenge the positioning of evidence as the neutral product of an apolitical process and demonstrate, through case studies and policy analysis, the social construction of evidence by those who make and seek to influence policy. The authors question the <b>epistemological</b> and ontological <b>basis</b> of different forms of evidence; the selective accommodation of evidence and voices within dominant policy discourses; and the popular conception of evidence-based policy as a benchmark of good policymaking.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{provides}} an overview of the research methodologies of systematic review and meta-analysis and uses a commentary on the analysis of data from a previously published study to illustrate the procedures and decision-making involved for consumers and those who may be considering carrying out a systematic review. Rationale: Systematic review and meta-analysis are located within a hierarchy of evidence-based practice, and their underlying <b>epistemological</b> and theoretical <b>basis</b> considered. The advantages of systematic review over traditional narrative reviews are discussed, together with the case for the use of meta-analysis to synthesise research findings. The feasibility of the use of these methodologies by educational psychologists is also considered. Findings: The worked example details the steps necessary to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis and the commentary addresses key issues such as specifying inclusion/exclusion criteria and determining relevance; specifying the literature search strategy and coping with the ‘grey’ literature; extracting and coding data from the included studies and the importance of reliability checks; study quality; selecting the most appropriate effect size; selecting the most appropriate model for meta-analysis (fixed-effect versus random-effect), combining and averaging effect sizes across studies; running weighted ANOVAs or meta-regression analyses to investigate heterogeneity; checks for publication bias; and sensitivity analysis to deal with outliers.

Therefore we aim to understand the processes of induction of the university teaching, as well as the didactic-pedagogic activities proposed in the Teaching Projects of a university from the south of Rio Grande do Sul. The research is naturally qualitative and documentary, it has been done through Content Analysis (Franco, 2008; Bardin, 1977). In the study were analyzed 163 projects, being highlighted three major points of innovative teaching practices: a) practical activities, including field exploring, use of lab and practical tasks in the classroom; b) new technologies, including the use of Blogs, MSN, AVA, robotics, moodle, modeling, videos, recordings, forums, and diaries e c) innovative methodologies, referring to learning projects, problem solving, workshops, work groups, articulation between teaching, research and extension and daily evaluation.

Data was collected through multiple focus group interviews {{in all three}} countries. Being true to the perspective of older women of three very different cultural regions, yet {{finding a way to}} contrast those perspectives, requires a continual and shared reflexive awareness of inherent methodological challenges. Those of a purely constructivist bent would say it is not even possible to do this in a rigorous way. Yet, for occupational science, the potential of such studies is significant. Examining multi-site international data on occupational experience and meaning uncovers and challenges Western assumptions rooted deep in occupational science’s theoretical constructs. The data is evocative and thought-provoking, but the analysis can raise more questions than it answers. Is the derived etic method sufficient to make internationally comparative studies trustworthy?

40|$|At present {{two options}} are {{available}} {{that can lead}} to a determination of how moral education may be possible in practice. One takes its formulation from the work of Kant, the other stands in the tradition of Aristotle. Kant emphasizes the importance of duty mid obligation. In contrast, Aristotle attempts to construct a theory of moral life on the practice of virtue. Both theoretical perspectives have debilitating deficiencies. A spectrum of moral experience is presented that represents the wood opportunities available to the agent in life experience. The polarities of this spectrum pull most naturally towards either an Aristotelian or a Kantian perspective, although neither perspective is capable of addressing the requirements of the entire spectrum. The Aristotelian perspective is associated with the life of non-dilemmic virtue, undertaken in community, where relational realities and the contextual contingency of moral life is emphasized. The Kantian perspective is associated with dilemmic situations to be resolved by a process of moral The central problem of the dissertation acknowledges the antithetical nature of these perspectives, and the dichotomous nature of their philosophical roots. The central task of the dissertation is the establishment of a dialogic process that has the potential to reconcile this dichotomy, and to allow these perspectives to mutually inform and reinforce each other. This task is accomplished by providing responses to a central research question that is accompanied by a series of subsidiary questions. From an analysis of various theories of moral education, Kohlberg's theory of structural developmentalism is chosen for reformulation as it is informed by the exploration of the requirements of the dialogic process.

40|$|Is {{there an}} <b>epistemological</b> and/or {{practical}} <b>basis</b> for {{an ethic of}} history {{at the close of the}} twentieth century? This dissertation focuses upon selected works within the tradition of Western metaphysics that have allowed such a question to become both recognizable and problematic today. ^ The problematic aspects of such a question become readily apparent. For it gives rise to the idea of a world-history—of a teleological historical process—which is all but unanimously considered to be of contemporary relevance only as a reminder of why the present defines itself as a “postmodern” age. ^ Furthermore, the concept of an ethic of history evokes the thought of the Kantian moral law which Georg Lukàcs described as early as 1914 as a depleted source of illumination that no longer serves as “the map of all possible paths. ” ^ But along with the philosophy of history as conceived by Herder, Hegel and Marx, the present has inherited a critique of that tradition whose origins lie in the Kantian system. Chapter 1 explores how Kant presents an ethic of history that is in fact deprived of the kind of objective or empirically verifiable measure capable of providing something like a road map for human action. For Kant the task of enforcing an unwritten and unrepresentable law is therefore conferred upon the human imagination. ^ Chapter 2 then focuses upon how Kant 2 ̆ 7 s critique of reason regulates the necessary yet potentially boundless and debilitating power of the imagination by instituting a theological supplement to the moral law. The very phrase “theological supplement” indicates that an unorthodox theological concept has thereby been introduced in order to establish and valorize a limit to the capacities of the human will. ^ Can such a limit be represented “atheologically”? This is the question underlying chapters 3 and 4. In chapter 3 Friedrich Schiller 2 ̆ 7 s program for an “aesthetic education” is interpreted as a supplement to the moral law that ends up by all but displacing it. Chapter 4, in turn, argues that Friedrich Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to displace the moral law succeeds in revitalizing it. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 In {{the past}} decade, {{issues related to}} {{cultural}} diversity and pluralism have risen to the forefront in education. The increasing cultural diversity in American classrooms and communities requires preservice teachers {{to be ready to}} promote multiple perspectives within their curricula and among their students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand how elementary preservice teachers engage in multicultural education. The researcher perspective is that of an African American woman working in a predominantly European American community. The connection between multicultural education theories and preservice teacher practices has not been consistently established. In order to bridge this gap, I used an experience-based methodology, drawing on close interaction with and observation of five participants over the course of a year. Different individuals exemplify the four themes that emerged from all five participants. The first and central theme that emerged was caring for individuals based on core beliefs. This is a crucial element for teaching in a multicultural society. Second, caring leads to willingness to dialogue on multiple perspectives, or any dichotomy, as a basis for understanding. Third, passionate pursuits become bases for action in the realm of multicultural education and for promoting the interests of all children. Fourth, openness to learn is a prerequisite to progress in multicultural education. Demonstrating caring concern, developing and encouraging passionate pursuits, and utilizing multiple perspectives through dialogue have been valuable in encouraging the openness to learn by preservice teachers as they facilitate a similar growth in their students. These same methods have shaped my research. I recognize that the themes that emerged from the participants are also embedded in the research method and reflect many appropriate college and elementary classroom teaching practices. These mirrored similarities are grounded in the metaphor of chaos theory. I also made connections to James Banks' Dimensions of Multicultural Education, and his Levels of Integration of Multicultural Content, and to LeoNora Cohen's Principles for Serving Students.
