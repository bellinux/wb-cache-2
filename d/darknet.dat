500|$|Anons {{launched}} Operation <b>Darknet</b> in October 2011, targeting websites hosting child pornography. In particular, {{the group}} hacked a child pornography site called [...] "Lolita City" [...] hosted by Freedom Hosting, releasing 1,589 usernames from the site. Anons {{also said that}} they had disabled forty image-swapping pedophile websites that employed the anonymity network Tor. In 2012, Anons leaked the names of users of a suspected child pornography site in OpDarknetV2. Anonymous launched the #OpPedoChat campaign on Twitter in 2012 as a continuation of Operation <b>Darknet.</b> In attempt to eliminate child pornography from the internet, the group posted the emails and IP addresses of suspected pedophiles on the online forum PasteBin.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, {{the administrators}} of Agora, a <b>darknet</b> market, {{announced}} {{they were taking}} the site offline {{in response to a}} recently discovered security vulnerability in Tor.

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{originally}} developed {{on behalf of}} the U.S. intelligence community and continues to receive U.S. government funding, and has been criticized as [...] "more resembl a spook project than a tool designed by a culture that values accountability or transparency". , 80% of The Tor Project's $2M annual budget came from the United States government, with the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation as major contributors, aiming [...] "to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states". Other public sources of funding include DARPA, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Government of Sweden. Some have proposed that the government values Tor's commitment to free speech, and uses the <b>darknet</b> to gather intelligence. Tor also receives funding from NGOs including Human Rights Watch, and private sponsors including Reddit and Google. Dingledine said that the United States Department of Defense funds are more similar to a research grant than a procurement contract. Tor executive director Andrew Lewman said that even though it accepts funds from the U.S. federal government, the Tor service did not collaborate with the NSA to reveal identities of users.|$|E

30|$|This topic {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{in the context of}} the activities of the HOMER 6 (HOmeMade Explosives and Recipes characterization) FP 7 EU project. An empirical study conducted by domain experts and law enforcement agents participating in HOMER has shown that, in addition to the numerous HME Web resources available on the Surface Web, the anonymous nature of the Dark Web facilitates the publishing of HME-related information, and hence, a crawler focused on the HME domain should be capable of traversing both the Surface and the Dark Web. This study also revealed that for the HME domain, there is an interconnection between the Surface and the Dark Web, as well as among the different <b>darknets</b> of the Dark Web. For example, Web sites containing HME-related information hosted on the Surface Web are likely to include hyperlinks to relevant content hosted on different <b>darknets,</b> such as Tor or I 2 P, and vice versa. This entails that it is really important for an HME-related crawler to be capable not only of traversing separately the several <b>darknets</b> present in the Dark Web but also of dealing with the interconnectivity encountered between the different <b>darknets</b> and/or the Surface Web during a single crawl. Lastly, this study also indicated that the local context of hyperlinks pointing to Tor and/or Freenet Web pages may not contain sufficient HME-related text; therefore, effective link selection should rely not only on the local context of hyperlinks, but also on additional evidence.|$|R
40|$|Threats to {{the privacy}} of users and to the {{availability}} of Internet infrastructure are evolving at a tremendous rate. To characterize these emerging threats, researchers must effectively balance monitoring {{the large number of}} hosts needed to quickly build confidence in new attacks, while still preserving the detail required to differentiate these attacks. One class of techniques that attempts to achieve this balance involves hybrid systems that combine the scalable monitoring of unused address blocks (or <b>darknets)</b> with forensic honeypots (or honeyfarms). In this paper we examine the properties of individual and distributed <b>darknets</b> to determine the effectiveness of building scalable hybrid systems. We show that individual <b>darknets</b> are dominated by a small number of sources repeating the same actions. This enables source-based techniques to be effective at reducing the number of connections to be evaluated by over 90 %. We demonstrate that the dominance of locally targeted attack behavior and the limited life of random scanning hosts result in few of these sources being repeated across <b>darknets.</b> To achieve reductions beyond source-based approaches, we look to source-distribution based methods and expand them to include notions of local and global behavior. We show that this approach is effective at reducing the number of events by deploying it in 30 production networks during early 2005. Each of the identified events during this period represented a major globally-scoped attack including the WINS vulnerability scanning, Veritas Backup Agent vulnerability scanning, and the MySQL Worm. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Network {{operators}} often apply policy-based traffic filtering at the egress of edge networks. These policies can {{be detected}} by performing active measurements; however, doing so involves instrumenting every network one wishes to study. We investigate a methodology for detecting policy-based service-level traffic filtering from passive observation of traffic markers within <b>darknets.</b> Such markers represent traffic we expect to arrive and, therefore, whose absence is suggestive of network filtering. We study the approach with data from five large <b>darknets</b> {{over the course of}} one week. While we show the approach has utility to expose filtering in some cases, there are also limits to the methodology. ...|$|R
50|$|While other <b>darknets</b> try to {{establish}} anonymity for their participants, {{that is not what}} dn42 aims for. It is a network to explore routing technologies used in the Internet and tries {{to establish}} direct non-NAT-ed connections between the members.|$|R
50|$|All <b>darknets</b> require {{specific}} software installed or {{network configurations}} made to access them, such as Tor, {{which can be}} accessed via a customised browser from Vidalia (aka the Tor browser bundle), or alternatively via a proxy configured to perform the same function.|$|R
5000|$|Bartlett gave a TEDTalk in June 2015 further {{examining}} the subject. His talk, entitled [...] "How the mysterious <b>Darknet</b> is going mainstream", introduces {{the idea behind}} the <b>Darknet</b> to the audience, followed by a walkthrough example {{of one of its}} websites called the Silk Road. He point out the familiarity of webpage design similar to consumer sites used in the larger commercial Web. Bartlett then presents examples of how operating in an uncertain, high-risk market like those in the <b>Darknet</b> actually breeds innovation that he believes can be applied to all markets in the future. As he points out, because vendors are always thinking of new ways to get around and protect themselves, the <b>Darknet</b> has become more decentralized, more customer friendly, harder to censor, and more innovative. As our societies are increasingly searching for more ways to retain privacy online, such changes as those occurring in the <b>Darknet</b> are not only innovative, but could be beneficial to commercial online websites and markets.|$|E

The Tor dark web may {{be referred to as}} onionland, a reference to the network's top level domain suffix [...]onion and the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing.|$|R
50|$|The OFF System {{is a kind}} of anonymous, fully {{decentralized}} P2P {{file sharing}} program and network. In contrast to other anonymous file sharing networks, which derive their anonymity from forwarding their data blocks via intermediate network nodes, OFF derives its anonymity from anonymizing the data files. Thus, the system refers to itself as a brightnet to contrast its method of operation with that of private file sharing systems known as <b>darknets</b> and with traditional, forwarding anonymous P2P programs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Routing in <b>Darknets,</b> {{membership}} concealing overlays for pseudonymous communication, {{like for}} instance Freenet, is insufficiently analyzed, barely understood, and highly inefficient. These systems at higher performance are promising privacy preserving solutions for social applications. This paper contributes a realistic analytical model and a novel routing algorithm with provable polylog expected routing length. Using the model, we additionally prove {{that this can}} not be achieved by Freenet’s routing. Simulations support that our proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than Freenet for realistic network sizes. I...|$|R
