50|$|A vacuum {{interrupter}} will have internal shields around the contacts {{and at the}} ends of the interrupter. The shields stop any contact material vaporized during the arc from condensing {{on the inside of the}} vacuum envelope. This would reduce the insulation strength of the envelope and ultimately would result in a <b>flash-over</b> of the interrupter when open. The shield material also helps control the shape of the electric field distribution inside the interrupter, which contributes to a higher open-circuit withstand voltage rating. Additionally, the shield system helps absorb some of the energy produced in the arc, increasing the interrupting rating of the device.|$|E
50|$|A typical hot-cathode {{thyratron}} uses {{a heated}} filament cathode, completely contained within a shield assembly with a control grid on one open side, which faces the plate-shaped anode. In the off situation the voltage {{on the control}} grid is negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. When positive voltage is applied to the anode, no current flows. When the control electrode is made less negative, electrons from the cathode can travel to the anode because the positive attraction from the anode prevails over the negative repulsion caused by the slightly negative voltage on the control grid. The electrons will ionize the gas by collisions with the gas in the tube, and an avalanche effect results, causing an arc discharge between cathode and anode. The shield prevents ionized current paths that might form within other parts of the tube. The gas in a thyratron is typically {{at a fraction of the}} pressure of air at sea level; 15 to 30 millibars (1.5 to 3 kPa) is typical. For a cold-cathode thyratron the trigger voltage on the control grid will typically be positive, and a <b>flash-over</b> from control grid to cathode will initiate the arc discharge in the tube.|$|E

The result obtained in this occasion was that the falling ratio of the <b>flash-over</b> voltage read (was observed to be) 10 - 12 %，which indicated that a neat clean surface of the insulator even wet with water did not result in so great a falling of the voltage, though influenced by the humidity of the atmospere as usual in this case.

Using a high-speed Imacon photographic camera it was established that a metallic particle near the insulator surface {{plays an important role in}} flashover development. The influence of the particle on <b>flash-over</b> development depends on the pressure of the SF 6 gas. At atmospheric pressure, the flashover was always initiated at a point on the particle farthest from the nearest electrode.

The wind blows towards the building for a worst-case situation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (2 D) is used for calculating convective heat transfers assuming a specific heat source for the fire. WINFIRE is used for the predicting of radiation. Due to convection and radiation the temperature in the windows would rise and the window will eventually break.

40|$|The {{formation}} of copper sulphide within oil filled high voltage electrical equipment {{can lead to}} the failure of the equipment. Incidents involving large transformers have been attributed to such contamination. Sealed equipment, working under high loads and containing mineral oil with high sulphur content, appear to be most at risk. The failure is caused by copper sulphide deposits which produce a low resistance path across and through the cellulose insulation and can lead to internal discharge and <b>flash-over.</b> However, the mechanism for how and why the copper sulphide forms on copper is largely an open question.

40|$|Under {{nanosecond}} pulsed coaxial electric field, surface flashover voltage {{over the}} interfaces between nylon 1010 and transformer oil increases almost linearly with gap length, and the steeper rising edge of applied pulse, the higher <b>flash-over</b> voltage. Surface flashover properties {{are closely related}} to the electric field at the triple junctions of solid-liquid-electrode and the field gradient along the interfaces. Although the increased difference between inner and outer electrode radii will enhance electric field strength at the triple junctions and nonuniformity degree of potential distribution along interfaces, it reduces simultaneously terribly the surface field strength of coaxial inner electrode, so that flashover voltage doesn’t descend, but ascends almost linearly with gap length. The average flashover strength in coaxial electric field can be estimated by that in uniform electric field for large enough difference between inner and outer electrode radii, which is useful to practical engineering design for coaxial pulsed power apparatuses...|$|E
40|$|High voltage {{breakdown}} in liquid argon {{is an important}} concern {{in the design of}} liquid argon time projection chambers, which are often used as neutrino and dark matter detectors. We have made systematic measurements of breakdown voltages in liquid argon along insulators surrounding negative rod electrodes where the breakdown is initiated at the anode. The measurements were performed in an open cryostat filled with commercial grade liquid argon exposed to air, and not the ultra-pure argon required for electron drift. While not addressing all high voltage concerns in liquid argon, these measurements have direct relevance to the design of high voltage feedthroughs especially for averting the common problem of <b>flash-over</b> breakdown. The purpose of these tests is to understand the effects of materials, of breakdown path length, and of surface topology for this geometry and setup. We have found that the only material-specific effects are those due to their permittivity. We have found that the breakdown voltage has no dependence on the length of the exposed insulator.

40|$|Electricity {{transmission}} {{system is a}} very complex system, which consists of several elements, such as overhead lines, substations and transformers, covers wide areas, is interconnected with several networks with numerous inter-dependencies. This highly integrated system is exposed to several hazards, leading to interruption of power supply. Natural hazards, such as an increased frequency of extreme weather events, including storms, icing, wet snow deposits, lighting, floods, avalanches, rock falls and landslides or changing air temperature have effects on transmission and lead to destruction of this infrastructure, which is also critical for society as it guarantees functioning of vital for society services. The reliability of critical electricity transmission infrastructure depends on its ability to ensure normal operation, to limit number of incidents and to avoid major incidents and to limit consequences of major incidents. The concept of reliability is closely connected with the concept of resilience, which is understood, in general, as the ability of a system to react and recover from anticipated disturbances and events. In regards to electricity transmission resilience is the ability of the power system to adapt, self-organize and recover or achieve the level even higher than those before the shock. This paper reviews three major natural hazards disasters, which resulted in significant blackouts in Europe. The first one is the 2003 blackout in Italy, which was caused by <b>flash-over</b> from trees. The second one is the 2003 blackout in Sweden, which was caused by rainstorms. The third one is the 2005 blackout in Germany, which was caused by wet snow. The inter-comparative analysis of these events allowed us to develop recommendations on electricity transmission network resilience...|$|E
30|$|Vertical greenery systems (VGS) {{are getting}} popular as a green {{cladding}} material. However, {{they have not}} been adequately assessed in terms of fire safety. Lack of maintenance and improper irrigation systems will cause drying of plants in VGS, creating substantial fire risk. Dry plants may be easily ignited and intensify the vertical spread of fire. However, potential fire hazards of VGS are barely discussed in the existing literature. The moisture content (MC) of a plant {{is one of the most}} critical factors affecting its ignitability. This study explores ignitability and fire risk of plants under radiative heat flux at different MCs. Three commonly used plant species for VGS—namely, Hedera helix Lowe, Peperomia obtusifolia (L.) A.Dietr., and Aglaonema commutatum Schott (the cultivar Lady Valentine)—were selected for study. These plants were subjected to natural drying under ambient conditions without water supply to simulate the plants in VGS without proper irrigation. The MC of the plants was measured and cone calorimeter testing was performed at different time intervals during their drying process. Ignition, heat release, and gaseous emissions were studied under radiative heat flux. When the plants were fresh and green, no ignition was observed for all three species. Hedera helix started to ignite once MC was lower than 243 %, at a heat flux of 50 kW m− 2. Peperomia obtusifolia began to ignite once MC dropped below 200 %, at a heat flux of 20 kW m− 2. Aglaonema commutatum ignition occurred once MC was lower than 316 %, at a heat flux of 50 kW m− 2. Cone calorimeter test data were used for analyzing the three key parameters: flashover propensity, total heat release per unit area, and smoke toxicity hazard. Analysis showed that low MC creates a high risk of <b>flash-over.</b> Thermal risk and smoke toxicity hazard also increased at lower MC, but the risk was low for the three plants tested. These findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining healthy live plants to ensure that fire risk of VGS is minimal. This study provides good direction for assessing and understanding the fire behavior of vegetation in VGS.|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis of}} the Building Technology track {{concerning}} fire resistance in a sun shading element {{as an alternative}} for fire retardant glazing was produced {{by the idea of}} Wiebe Schotanus from the Safety Region Haaglanden, who proposed the idea of combining sunshading and fire retardant properties as an alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing. The subject fire safety has grown in the past years into a major field of study, which is becoming more important in the building industry. This growth can also be seen in changes in the Dutch Building Decree the past years and in the built environment. Also in architecture there is an increasing demand for glass. Because of these factors also the demand for fire retardant glazing has increased as well as the demand for other fire retardant products and sunshading. In order to meet the increasing demand for glass in architecture, coupled with the increasing demand for sunshading elements and the growth of fire retardant products, in this thesis a concept design is developed for a fire retardant sun shading element as a design alternative for fire retardant glazing in public buildings. Herewith the chance on the development of fire by <b>flash-over</b> via the outside of a building should decrease and a cheaper design alternative for fire retardant glazing is proposed. To develop this concept research studies has been done to fire development, rules regarding fire safety in public buildings in Holland according to the Dutch Building Decree, fire retardant and sunshading products and materials in order to set a program of requirements. This is followed by simulations in the computer programs TRA and TRISCO in order to simulate the heat transfer during a fire in a room, especially in the glass and the façade and {{in order to determine the}} optimal distance between the window and the sunshading element on the inside. Also simulations are made with the same distances (75 and 100 mm) between the window and the element as the distances used in the measurements in order to compare them. With the use of prototypes made out of playing cards, wood and steel a couple of problems were solved and the mechanism to open and close the sunshading were tested. The mechanism of the fire retardant shading element closes automatically in case of fire, without the use of human effort or electricity. This is done by a wire which melts at high temperatures, with the result that the lamellae close automatically. At last measurements are performed in an oven of 700 degrees Celsius in order to test this self-closing mechanism and to measure the temperature rise in the glass in different situations, with the use of the fire retardant shading element and with two different glass thicknesses of 4 and 6 mm. The fire retardant shading element is tested at a distance of 75 and 100 mm from the window, in opened and closed situation and at last also a closed element with a fire retardant coating at a distance of 75 mm is tested. The system closed itself, because of the high temperatures and the melted wire, in around 10 seconds. One of the most important conclusions for as well the simulations as well as for the measurements is that how further away the element is from the heat source (fire), the less radiation it receives and how longer it takes for the glass pane to break. Also it takes longer for the glass to break when the 6 mm glass pane is used, because of the bigger mass. The fire retardant coating expanded because of the high temperatures from 1 mm to 20 - 30 mm, but did not have a remarkable effect on the time in which the glass pane broke. This probably because of the higher temperature in the oven in comparison to the other measurements and because of the conducted heat from the steel frame to the glass, because the frame was not coated or insulated and heat transfer from the steel to the glass was possible. But the fire retardant coating prevented the flames from raging to the outside of the element and the window when it was broken. So the element does prevent <b>flash-over</b> via the outside. Hereby a concept design is developed for a design alternative for fire retardant glazing. Naturally, this concept needs further study and more testing before it will become a definitive alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing.

40|$|A {{facility}} {{based on}} a next-generation, high-flux D-D neutron generator (HFNG) was commissioned at the University of California Berkeley. The characterization of the HFNG {{is presented in the}} following study. The current generator design produces near mono-energetic 2. 45 MeV neutrons at outputs of 10 ^ 8 n/s. Calculations provided show that future conditioning at higher currents and voltages will allow for a production rate over 10 ^ 10 n/s. Characteristics that affect the operational stability include the suppression of the target-emitted back streaming electrons, target sputtering and cooling, and ion beam optics. Suppression of secondary electrons resulting from the deuterium beam striking the target was achieved via the implementation of an electrostatic shroud with a voltage offset of greater than - 400 V relative to the target. Ion beam optics analysis resulted {{in the creation of a}} defocussing extraction nozzle, allowing for cooler target temperatures and a more compact design. To calculate the target temperatures, a finite difference method (FDM) solver incorporating the additional heat removal effects of subcooled boiling was developed. Validation of the energy balance results from the finite difference method calculations showed the iterative solver converged to heat removal results within about 3 % of the expected value. Testing of the extraction nozzle at 1. 43 mA and 100 kV determined that overheating of the target did not occur as the measured neutron flux of the generator was near predicted values. Many factors, including the target stopping power, deuterium atomic species, and target loading ratio, affect the flux distribution of the HFNG neutron generator. A detailed analysis to understand these factors effects is presented. Comparison of the calculated flux of the neutron generator using deuteron depth implantation data, neutron flux distribution data, and deuterium atomic species data matched the experimentally calculated flux determined from indium foil irradiations. An overview of experiments using the HFNG, including medical isotope cross section measurements, geochronology, delayed gamma measurements from uranium fission, and single event upset of cpu's is discussed. Future work should focus on the reduction of beam induced arcing between the shroud and the vacuum chamber. Investigation of insulator charge build-up, as well as electrical <b>flash-over</b> of insulators should be explored. The reduction of beam induced arcing will allow for larger beam currents and acceleration voltages, therefore increasing the neutron flux...|$|E
