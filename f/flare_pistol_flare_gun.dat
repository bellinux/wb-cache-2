50|$|A gas pistol is a {{non-lethal}} weapon used for self-defense and other purposes. It is typically a close-to-exact replica or conversion {{of a real}} handgun made {{to be able to}} fire tear gas cartridges only. Effective range is up to 4.5 metres depending on caliber. For legal purposes various techniques are used during manufacture/conversion to prevent the use of live ammunition, such as using calibers exclusive to gas cartridges, welding obstacles into a non-removable barrel and using malleable metal alloys. Gas pistols are prevalent in European countries with strict gun control laws. Gas pistols are also used in weapons training, and as starting <b>pistols,</b> <b>flare</b> <b>guns,</b> and movie props.|$|R
50|$|The Nahverteidigungswaffe was a {{smoke bomb}} {{discharger}} for German panzers which {{could also be}} used as a close defense weapon to combat close assaulting infantry. It was a 92mm rotating launcher for smoke bombs, mounted in the roof of the turret or superstructure, which also allowed the occupants to fire a <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> through it. The <b>flare</b> <b>pistol</b> could fire <b>flares,</b> smoke rounds or small calibre fragmentation grenades.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a single-shot <b>pistol</b> is the <b>flare</b> <b>gun.</b> Although not {{intended}} to be a weapon, many variants have been made (See <b>Flare</b> <b>gun).</b> One example is the Kampfpistole, or Sturmpistole in its final form, which was designed to function as an anti-tank weapon.|$|R

50|$|Webley & Scott {{produced}} {{a number of}} single-shot, break open signal <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 <b>Flare</b> <b>Pistol</b> is in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum, Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. J. Errol Boyd (1891-1960). Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the plane Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England. The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner’s initials. The company logo {{is that of a}} bird wing with the tips angling left and W+S underneath and the gun is stamped 7648.|$|R

It is apparent that Deborah has incestuous feelings for Adam, resulting in her subsequent possessiveness and need to rid his life of any other woman.

50|$|Dedicated <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> {{exist that}} fire flares. They are {{typically}} {{used as a}} distress signal {{as well as other}} signaling purposes at sea and between aircraft and people on the ground. The majority of <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> are 12 gauge, but they should not ever be loaded with live ammunition. The amount of pressure generated by a typical 12 gauge shotgun shell (11,500 psi according to SAAMI) far exceeds the pressure most <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> can control. Firing shotgun shells from a modern plastic <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> can have deadly results for the user and should not be done.|$|R

The ship fired water cannons and <b>flare</b> <b>pistols</b> at the pirates, and attempted to outmaneuver them, but its constant maneuvers forced it to a speed of nine knots after one hour, after which the pirates attached an assault ladder and began boarding. The captain then ordered that all food and water be hidden in the steering compartment, and activated the ship's distress beacon, after which he and the crew barricaded themselves in the engine room, where they repulsed two attempts by the pirates to force their way in. The pirates would hold the ship for 20 hours.|$|R
