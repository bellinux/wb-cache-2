5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do <b>know</b> <b>in</b> general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not <b>know.</b> <b>In</b> the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs.

5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not <b>know</b> <b>in</b> what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals seemed to <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until {{too late in the}} game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft zone defense instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E

5|$|McBride & the Ride {{was created}} in 1989 when Tony Brown, then the {{executive}} vice president of MCA Records, decided to establish a new country music band in order to compete with Alabama, who he thought was falling out of favor with country radio. At the time, guitarist Ray Herndon (born July 14, 1960) was serving as a backing musician for Lyle Lovett, then a recording artist for MCA. Brown suggested that Herndon join lead vocalist Terry McBride (born September 16, 1958), whom Herndon did not yet <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> the new band that Brown had planned. McBride, a musician since childhood, had worked as a backing musician for his father, Dale McBride, and later for Delbert McClinton and Rosie Flores. At the Fan Fair in Nashville, Tennessee, Brown introduced McBride and Herndon to drummer Billy Thomas (born October 24, 1953), who had previously played for Emmylou Harris and Mac Davis, and the band's lineup was in place. Brown had also chosen steel guitarist Steve Fishell to be a fourth member, but Fishell declined and chose to work as a record producer instead. The trio pitched their songs through the assistance of songwriters Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, and four of those demos ended up on the band's first album.|$|E
