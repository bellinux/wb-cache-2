25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E
500|$|Tony Geraghty also {{attempted}} to escape; {{but he was}} caught by the gunmen and shot {{at least four times}} {{in the back of the}} head and back. Both men had pleaded for their lives before they were shot; one <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out, [...] "Please don't shoot me, don't kill me".|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{designed the}} game like a [...] "Japanese garden", where {{they attempted to}} remove all of the game elements that did not fit with the others, so the emotions they wanted the game to evoke would come through. This minimalism is intended to make the game feel intuitive to the player, so they can explore and {{feel a sense of}} wonder without direct instructions. The story arc of the game is designed to explicitly follow Joseph Campbell's monomyth theory of narrative, or hero's journey, as well as to represent the stages of life, so as to enhance the emotional connection of the players as they journey together. In his D.I.C.E. speech, Chen noted that three of their 25 testers <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> upon completing the game.|$|E

500|$|Zap2it's Carina Adly MacKenzie commented {{positively}} on Michele's [...] "beautiful" [...] {{rendition of}} [...] "Papa, Can You Hear Me?", however expressed displeasure that Rachel <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> during her solo in three consecutive episodes, suggesting the producers {{give her a}} more uplifting song. She praised Salling's [...] "Only the Good Die Young", which was selected by Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post as the best performance of the episode, for being the most in-keeping with Glee usual tone. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand", writing that, [...] "the Beatles' coy flirtation is replaced with a simple, wistful plea that hits just the right note." [...] She commended Riley's vocals on [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", commenting that Murphy should assign Mercedes more solo performances. Futterman criticized [...] "Losing My Religion", however, observing that Monteith struggled to reach the notes, resulting in a performance [...] "more awkward than inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{twenty minutes}} of Saldívar's surrender, {{she was taken}} to the {{downtown}} police station in Corpus Christi and placed in an interrogation room with investigators Paul and Ray Rivera. Paul Rivera, who had investigated homicides since 1978, informed Saldívar of her right to an attorney, which she waived. When police investigators surrounded Saldívar's truck, she <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out, [...] "I can't believe I killed my best friend". Within hours, she was saying the shooting was accidental. Saldívar's bail bond was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000. When bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price on her head and spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.|$|E
2500|$|The judge {{added that}} if the {{offences}} had taken place after the law was changed in 2003, several of the offences of which Clifford was found guilty would have been tried as rape, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. One of Clifford's victims explained to the court that Clifford's assault on her (at age 15) had prevented her from having her first sexual relationship with a partner her own age, while another {{said that in the}} years following the assault she <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> whenever she saw Clifford on television, and had feared that the police would laugh at her. Clifford dismissed his victims as [...] "fantasists" [...] and [...] "opportunists". The judge concluded that Clifford had caused an [...] "additional element of trauma" [...] to his victims by his [...] "contemptuous attitude" [...] during the trial.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was taken}} to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where he was treated for severe {{injuries}} in the intensive-care unit. He was in serious but stable condition (updated to [...] "fair" [...] on April 23), and unable to speak because of the wound to his throat. According {{to one of the}} nurses, he <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> for two days straight after waking up. He responded to authorities in writing and by nodding his head, although he did manage to say the word [...] "no" [...] when asked if he could afford a lawyer. Court documents released in August 2013, show that Tsarnaev had a skull fracture and gunshot wounds prior to being taken into custody. According to a doctor that treated him, Tsarnaev had a skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, the lateral portion of his C1 vertebra, with a significant soft tissue injury, as well as injury to the pharynx, the mouth, and a small vascular injury.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Chandler, who was 25 at {{the time}} of the trial, chose to leave the country rather than testify, and the only person in his family who {{appeared}} for questioning was his mother, June. She denied having seen any molestation, but talked about Jordan and Michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions, explaining that she initially didn't want them to, but was persuaded by Jackson, who <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> and been hurt that she didn't trust him. She testified about Jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family, the trips they'd been on together, and how fun it was to be part of Jackson's world. She said she'd been concerned that her son was starting to dress like Jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him. When asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her family's involvement with Michael Jackson, June Chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money, it was not she who sued Jackson, but rather Jordan and his father Evan who did so. [...] She claimed not to recall that Jackson had counter sued for extortion, or that her second husband, Dave Schwartz, had sued Jackson, or that Evan Chandler had sued Jackson a second time. Thomas Mesereau said in a Harvard lecture later that year, [...] "the prosecutors tried to get [...] to show up, and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had not spoken to her son Jordan in 11 years, since 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] for {{the first}} time in November 2010 on the BBC music show. Later, with Jools Holland before the release of the album. As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment. [...] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011. She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while [...] "special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend" [...] as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph. Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and then I had a vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing at me because he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You." [...] Later, the song was performed during a VH1 special called [...] "Unplugged". Adele also performed the song at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 24 February 2011. The same day she performed [...] "Someone like You" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E

60|$|After devoting {{some ten}} minutes to steady brainwork she {{permitted}} herself the indulgence of a few tears. She did not often behave in this shockingly weak way, her role in life hitherto having been that of the one calm person in a disrupted world. When her father had lost his job, and the rent was due, and Brother Jim had fallen in the mud {{to the detriment of}} his only suit of clothes, and Brothers Terence and Mike had developed respectively a sore throat and a funny feeling in the chest, she had remained dry-eyed and capable. Her father <b>had</b> <b>cried,</b> her brother Jim <b>had</b> <b>cried,</b> her brother Terence <b>had</b> <b>cried,</b> and her brother Mike <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> in a manner that made the weeping {{of the rest of the}} family seem like the uncanny stillness of a summer night; but she had not shed a tear.|$|E
