2500|$|So-called time-stepping integrators are {{dedicated}} numerical schemes <b>for</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>systems</b> with many contacts. The first time-stepping integrator {{was introduced by}} J.J. Moreau. The integrators do not aim at resolving switching points and are therefore very robust in application. As the integrators do work with the integral of the contact forces and not with the forces itself, the methods can handle both non-impulsive motion and impulsive events like impacts. As a drawback, the accuracy of time-stepping integrators is low. This lack can be fixed by using a step-size refinement at switching points. Smooth parts of the motion are processed by larger step sizes, and higher order integration methods {{can be used to}} increase the integration order.|$|E
