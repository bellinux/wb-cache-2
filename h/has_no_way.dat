5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E

25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E

25|$|The B {{subunits}} form a five-membered or pentameric ring, {{where one}} end of the A subunit goes into and is held. This B subunit ring is also capable of binding to a receptor {{on the surface of the}} host cell. Without the B subunits, the A subunit <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of attaching to or entering the cell, and thus no way to exert its toxic effect. Cholera toxin, shiga toxin, and SubAB toxin all have B subunits that are made up of five identical protein components, meaning that their B subunits are homopentamers. Pertussis toxin is different where its pentameric ring is made up of four different protein components, where one of the components is repeated to form a heteropentamer.|$|E
25|$|Organisms need to {{replicate}} their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage {{is one of}} the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. Diploid individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via homologous recombination, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in a haploid individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the DNA repair machinery <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was. The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.|$|E

The four come across a frightened groundsman who warns them they shouldn’t be there, only to have another man appear and use magic to knock the unwanted visitors out. Hours later, they wake up in a cage of enchanted bars and are greeted by the warden, who believes that the Dark One must have sent them; they are enemies. They convince the warden that Gold is their enemy as well, and their arrival was an accident on his part in trying to wake Belle; however, the warden keeps them prisoner anyhow. The groundsman then visits the four, and agrees to help them if they will take him to Storybrooke.|$|E

Later in the trip, Dolores falls ill and Humbert checks her into a hospital while he stays in a nearby motel. After several days, he contacts a nurse at the hospital to inquire about Dolores's condition. However, the nurse surprises him by saying her uncle has paid her bill, checked her out and has taken her to her grandfather's home. Humbert knows Lolita has no living relatives and immediately realizes something is very wrong. He embarks on a frantic search to find Dolores and her abductor but fails.|$|E

Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it.
