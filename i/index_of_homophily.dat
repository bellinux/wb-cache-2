40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the evolution of}} a network in a discrete time, stochastic setting in which agents learn about each other through repeated interactions and maintain/break links {{on the basis of what}} they learn from these interactions. Agents have homophilous preferences and limited capacity, so they maintain links with others who are learned to be similar to themselves and cut links to others who are learned to be dissimilar to themselves. Thus learning influences the evolution of the network, but learning is imperfect so the evolution is stochastic. Homophily matters. Higher levels <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> decrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before learning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less clustering than under complete information. There may be big differences between the networks that emerge under complete and incomplete information. Homophily matters here as well: initially, greater levels <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> increase the difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but sufficiently high levels <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> eventually decrease the difference. Complete and incomplete information networks differ the most when the degree <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> is intermediate. With multiple stages of life, the effects of incomplete information are large initially but fade somewhat over time...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity and accessibility of the Internet, {{there is a}} need to reexamine dating and relationship preferences in the high-tech information age. Previously research pertaining to dating has focused on relationships and attitudes as well as the concept <b>of</b> <b>homophily.</b> In an effort to bridge the gap between previous dating conclusions and a modern means for meeting people, this research is an attempt to determine if previously established conclusions about homophily transcend to mate selection conducted through the use of the Internet. This research utilizes content analysis of online personal advertisements in order to compare the demographic characteristics and personal interests of advertisers with the characteristics and interests of those whom he or she is seeking. For this study a sample of 511 personal advertisements was selected from a popular national website service. The sample includes advertisers living in one southern U. S. city who are seeking either heterosexual or homosexual relationships. Using deductive coding to examine demographic and interest characteristics and inductive coding to explore the self-expressed behavior of the advertiser as well as the behavior sought, the principle <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> was examined through descriptive statistics. Consistent with the prior literature, findings for this study suggest that certain demographic characteristics such as race, education, and marital status exhibit moderate to high degrees <b>of</b> <b>homophily.</b> Findings also suggest high to moderate degrees <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in other demographic characteristics such as body type, smoking habits, and alcohol-drinking habits.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new model to {{understand}} the nature and structure <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in social networks. We introduce heterogeneity to the study of stochastic network formation and show that meeting friends of friends tends to reduce social segregation. This allows us to derive sharp theoretical predictions on homophily patterns. Our main result is that individuals with more connections tend to have more diverse networks. Our theoretical predictions are well supported empirically when looking at friendships between boys and girls in U. S. high schools. We derive some welfare implications and show that our analysis can help identify the source <b>of</b> <b>homophily...</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{development}} of the shape of the cumulative degree distribution curve the effects of the link structure of existing nodes (among themselves and with new nodes) and homophily work against each other, with the former leading to concavity and homophily causing convexity. Consequently, there is a level <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> such that the two effects cancel each other out and the cumulative degree distribution reaches a linear shape in a log-log scale. Large variety of shapes observed in empirical studies of real complex networks may be explained by these phenomena. A low level <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> could then be linked to a convex shape of cumulative degree distributions which have been observed in networks of Facebook wall posts, Flickr users, and message boards; while linear shapes have been noted in the networks of and software class dependency, Yahoo adverts, and YouTube users. Compared to these two shapes, convexity seems to be much less prevalent with examples in Google Plus and Filmtipset networks. This {{can be explained by the}} argument that high levels <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> may significantly decrease the viability of networks, hence making convexity less frequent in complex networks.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} random network model {{incorporating}} heterogeneity of agents and a continuous notion <b>of</b> <b>homophily.</b> Unlike {{the vast majority}} of the corresponding economic literature, we capture <b>homophily</b> in terms <b>of</b> similarity rather than equality by assuming that the probability of linkage between two agents continuously decreases in the distance of their characteristics. A homophily parameter directly determines the strength of this effect. As a main result, we show that for any positive level <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> our model exhibits clustering, that is an increased probability of linkage given a common neighbor. As opposed to this, the seminal Bernoulli Random Graph model 0 la Erd 1 ̆ 51 s and R 9 nyi (1959) is comprised as the limit case <b>of</b> no <b>homophily.</b> Moreover, simulations indicate that the well-known small-world phenomenon is preserved even at high homophily levels.

40|$|Macroscopic {{behavior}} {{of scientific and}} societal systems results from the aggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but connecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has traditionally been difficult. Manifestations <b>of</b> <b>homophily,</b> the notion that individuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed in many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior translates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be, remains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the population dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a macroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela, a 3 -month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61 million people, making it the largest gathering {{in the history of}} humanity. While we find strong overall evidence for both types <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> for residents <b>of</b> different states, participants from low-representation states show considerably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than those from high-representation states. These manifestations <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> are amplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we estimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that homophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales of human behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> {{states that}} people who share certain characteristics will interact more often and more closely {{than those who are}} dissimilar. In general, homophily is found to have a strong influence on the organisation of social networks. The categories which lead most directly to strong homophily are race and ethnicity. Many activist movements have been found to tend towards homophily, which can have profound limiting effects on their impacts and successes. This paper will examine the extent <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> and networking within Aboriginal activism in Townsville, QLD. It will focus specifically on the daily demonstrations that were held outside the trial of Senior-Sergeant Chris Hurley. At this trial I acted as a participant-observer, attending daily and helping with organisation. What I witnessed was a concerted effort to avoid homophily. Personal invitations were extended by activists to non-Aboriginal academics, feminists, religious organisations, and even the police. This very deliberate attempt to diversify the demonstrations outside the courthouse happened at the expense of homophilic ties. While this has positive effects such as a broadening of support bases, a certain level <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> is important for the creation of collective identity. What is needed is a balance between homogeneity and diversity...|$|R
5000|$|To fully {{understand}} heterophily, {{it is important}} to understand the meaning and importance <b>of</b> <b>homophily.</b> The theory <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> states that [...] "similarity breeds connection." [...] Homophily has two specific types, status homophily and value homophily. Status homophily are ascribed statuses such as race, gender, and age. Value homophily refers to shared beliefs and practices between individuals. Studies <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> have linked attraction between individuals based on similarly shared demographics. These may include, but are not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status. In fact, according to The logic of social bias: The structural demography of heterophily by Ray Reagans, the first component is the intrinsic level of interpersonal attraction due to homophily. Individuals are more likely to form social groups based upon what they have on common. This creates strong ties within the group. Mark Granovetter defined the strength of a tie as a [...] "combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy, and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie". However, Granovetter's article suggested that weak ties are also instrumental in building social networks. He believed that weak ties could be possibly more effective than strong ties in reaching individuals. Findings like this have been referenced when discussing heterophily.|$|R
50|$|Homophily is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the way people tend to link up with others {{due to the fact that}} they share similar characteristics.

30|$|The {{emergence}} of {{social networking sites}} (SNSs) allows to observe the extent <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> from a computational social science perspective, bypassing possible biases induced by surveys or small and limited samples while getting evidence from digital traces of millions of users.

As we spend more and more time on social networking services, and they are becoming fundamental pathways for information flow in our society [6], understanding the impact <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in this context is particularly important for comprehending phenomena such as the dynamics of technology adoption, social contagion and segregation [7 – 9].|$|R
50|$|Network homophily {{refers to}} the theory in network science which states that, based on node attributes, similar nodes may be more like to attach to each other than {{dissimilar}} ones.

30|$|The other vital factor, {{particularly}} in context of FVCs {{pertains to the}} ethnicity of the team members.

The impact <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> resulting from similar experiences, organizational structures and goals has already been found to aid VC syndication (Sorenson and Stuart, 2008).

40|$|Abstract Biases {{in meeting}} {{opportunities}} have been recently shown {{to play a}} key role for the emergence <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in social networks (see Currarini et al., 2009). The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a simple microfoundation of these biases in a model where the size and type-composition of the meeting pools are shaped by agents׳ socialization decisions. In particular, agents either inbreed (direct search only to similar types) or outbreed (direct search to population at large). When outbreeding is costly, this is shown to induce stark equilibrium behavior of a threshold type: agents “inbreed” (i. e. mostly meet their own type) if, and only if, their group is above certain size. We show that this threshold equilibrium generates patterns of in-group and cross-group ties that are consistent with empirical evidence <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in two paradigmatic instances: high school friendships and interethnic marriages...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{emergence}} of strong controversial issues in modern societies is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea {{is the fact that}} the increasing <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> in social networks, due to the modern ICT, can be a driving force for opinion polariation. In this paper we address the problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps.

We show that as homophily increases {{the emergence}} of marked topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus formation.

30|$|The lack of {{detailed}} information about the users prohibits us from assessing manifest homophily, and our analysis is thus subject to the problem <b>of</b> latent <b>homophily</b> which is generally confounded with contagion [8]. We assess homophily with the opinionated reciprocal neighborhood size of a user, which is the weighted number of reciprocal followees (i.e., followees who are also followers of that user). Bidirectional follower relationships mean that two users are interested in receiving messages from each other, which we assume {{to indicate that the}} users may share similar interests, which in turn suggests homophily. To further reduce the confounding effects <b>of</b> <b>homophily</b> and contagion, our model contains covariates for the number of shared followees and followers. These covariates are expected to control for latent homophily to a certain extent, since homophily is known to manifest itself in network clustering [8, 22]. Our findings suggest that the effects <b>of</b> <b>homophily,</b> insofar as we can measure it, are content-dependent: the positive reciprocal neighborhood size does generally not have significant effects (Figure  3 C and D), while increasing negative reciprocal neighborhood size has the expected effects of predicting decreased positive and increased negative sentiment expression (Figure  3 A and B). This finding further contributes to favoring the spread of negative vaccination sentiments.|$|R
