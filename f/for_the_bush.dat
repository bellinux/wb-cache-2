500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|After September 11, Bush {{announced}} a global War on Terror.

In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an [...] "axis of evil" [...] consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was [...] "arming to threaten {{the peace of the}} world" [...] and [...] "pose a grave and growing danger". The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.

He was an early proponent of Operation Iraqi Freedom and defender of the Administration's anti-terrorism record. He became at odds with President Bush's position against same-sex marriage in 2004.

500|$|Marco {{was later}} {{killed in a}} bush fire disaster. Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done it at her grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just {{to get to this}} point. This should really be a happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person. Blair said it saw her become well-equipped to look after her child.|$|E

[...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory.

500|$|First, Homer sends bottle rockets at George's window, and George puts up {{a banner}} reading [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", in {{reference}} to Bart and Homer.

Homer and Bart are making their way through the sewers to release locusts in George's house when George spots them and climbs down. Homer and George begin fighting, so Bart releases the locusts which attack George. At the same time, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives at the mansion to bring a house warming present <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> family. Finally, after pressure from his wife, George apologizes to Homer in front of Gorbachev, much to George's dislike. The Bushes eventually move out and sell the house to Gerald Ford, another former President. Ford invites Homer to watch a football game with him, and to enjoy some beer and nachos at his house. The two quickly get off to a good start, sharing common ground.|$|E

When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president.
