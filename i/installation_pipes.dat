50|$|Steam {{heating systems}} are rarely {{installed}} in new single-family residential construction {{owing to the}} cost of the piping <b>installation.</b> <b>Pipes</b> must be carefully sloped to prevent trapped condensate blockage. Compared to other methods of heating, it is more difficult to control the output of a steam system. However, steam can be sent, for example, between buildings on a campus to allow use of an efficient central boiler and low cost fuel. Tall buildings take advantage of the low density of steam to avoid the excessive pressure required to circulate hot water from a basement-mounted boiler. In industrial systems, process steam used for power generation or other purposes can also be tapped for space heating. Steam for heating systems may also be obtained from heat recovery boilers using otherwise wasted heat from industrial processes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{shows the}} {{influence}} of select parameters of drawing process on the expansive deposition of inner PE lining in pipelines. Design/methodology/approach: The study included assessment {{of the impact of}} diameter reduction degree, drawing die angle, temperature, introductory pipe diameter, and introductory pipe wall thickness on the viscoelastic return. Obtained dependencies were assumed to be the basis for formulation of conclusions as to the choice of essential process conditions for the technological sequence of PE lining deposition in the outer coating of <b>installation</b> <b>pipes</b> or reconstruction of a transmission channel. Findings: The final effect presentation is worked out methodology used in identification of physical parameters of a PE pipe drawing model as the main phase of a viscoelastic deposition of lining in two-layer pipes. Particular attention was focused on the need to take into consideration changing friction conditions in the drawing die area and to determine the value of the friction factor. Research limitations/implications: The research did not show {{the influence of}} the length of the sizing and drawing speed on the viscoelastic return. Practical implications: The practical effect is to develop the characteristics of the impact of process parameters on the size of time to viscoelastic return. Originality/value: Paper represents model of PE lining deposition in the outer coating of <b>installation</b> <b>pipes</b> or reconstruction of a transmission network...|$|E
30|$|The most {{difficult}} task in calibrating a WDN {{is the proper}} selection of the pipe roughness coefficients such as the Hazen–Williams coefficients. For estimation of pipe roughness coefficients, it is preferable to have a field survey regarding pipe materials and the year of <b>installation.</b> <b>Pipes</b> of different materials such as cast iron, ductile iron and HDPE have been installed at different locations and at different times. The length and diameter of all pipes are obtained from available records and validated by field survey. The initial Hazen–Williams (HW) coefficients are assigned groupwise {{on the basis of}} pipe material and age of installation in years as: Group 1 (CI above 30  years)— 85; Group 2 (CI below 30  years)— 100; Group 3 (DI below 10  years)— 125; and Group 4 (HDPE below 10  years)— 135. The numbers of pipe in the four groups 1 – 4 were 11, 216, 49 and 158, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary notes The {{enterprises}} want to minimise {{the overall}} production costs, {{to maintain the}} quality and to increase the competitiveness on the market. It is possible {{to increase the number}} of customers, efficiency and effectiveness through the product quality. Therefore, every enterprise needs to have a good organisational structure, good experts and the knowledge how to do qualitative work. The paper shows the application of expert system to the problem of selection of <b>installation</b> <b>pipes</b> according to the given attributes. The input attributes are: mechanical load, material, colour, flame resistance, length, packaging, temperature range and outer diameter. The output parameter is the type of installation pipe. The expert system can give a second opinion, explicitly and in detail. They have the intelligent database and the possibility to adopt new knowledge, but also have a disadvantage that they use only the stored data to create solutions. Therefore, it is necessary to change the data according to a situation in the given environment. Despite the disadvantages o...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical damage {{involving}} dents with gouges {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of transmission pipeline failures in terms of both static and cyclic pressure loading. Because of the severity of this defect type, pipeline companies are required to respond to these anomalies by either removing damaged sections or repair using welded sleeves. For more than 10 years, composite materials have been used to repair corroded pipelines and their use has gained wide acceptance across the pipeline industry. Numerous systems have been tested with results being presented in the open literature. Testing was recently performed to assess the use of a water-activated composite repair system, Aquawrap®, in terms of its ability to repair mechanical damage subjected to cyclic pressure service. The Aquawrap ® repair system has been extensively tested on corrosion defects but testing on pipes with dents had not been done. The water activated pre-preg urethane resin system offers excellent long tern (creep-rupture) strength combined with easy low cost field <b>installation.</b> <b>Pipes</b> having diameter to wall thickness ratios ranging from 34 to 68 were fitted with dents and gouges. Repair involved removing the gouged material of the pipe after indentation and repairing using the composite sleeve. The result of this specific test program showed that on-average the fatigue life for mechanically-damaged pipes can be increased on the order of three orders of magnitude when repaired by grinding and installing composite sleeves. This paper provides details on the methodology of the test program, results, and most importantly, information that can be used by operators in repairing their pipeline systems...|$|E
