50|$|A {{forklift}} (also called lift truck, <b>fork</b> <b>truck,</b> and forklift truck) is a powered {{industrial truck}} used to lift and move materials over short distances.

Since World War II, the use and development of the forklift truck have greatly expanded worldwide. Forklifts have become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing.

5000|$|Capacity or {{rated load}} - The rated {{capacity}} of the ramp must always exceed the greatest total moving load (including goods, persons and transport equipment). If there is any likelihood of changes to operations; it is always better to over specify than under specify. It is also vitally important to be aware if quoted capacities are total load (uniformly distributed load: UDL), or single axle (dynamic load) capacities. Under heavy braking it is quite feasible to have {{the full weight of}} the <b>fork</b> <b>truck</b> acting through its front wheels only, therefore it is important to ensure the single axle rating of the ramp is sufficiently high.|$|E

50|$|Forklifts are a {{critical}} element of warehouses and distribution centers. It’s imperative that these structures {{be designed to}} accommodate their efficient and safe movement. In the case of Drive-In/Drive-Thru Racking, a forklift needs to travel inside a storage bay that is multiple pallet positions deep to place or retrieve a pallet. Often, forklift drivers are guided into the bay through guide rails {{on the floor and}} the pallet is placed on cantilevered arms or rails. These maneuvers require well-trained operators. Since every pallet requires the truck to enter the storage structure, damage is more common than with other types of storage. In designing a drive-in system, dimensions of the <b>fork</b> <b>truck,</b> including overall width and mast width, must be carefully considered.|$|E

40|$|The Eaton Cutler-Hammer {{facility}} has two separate areas of assembly. Eleven production lines compose the Load Center Assembly Area while 17 production lines compose the Metering/Meter Breaker/ACD Assembly Area. Currently, 11 fork trucks {{are used in}} the facility to bring parts from receiving to storage where they can be picked up when needed by the assembly lines. Fork trucks also take packaged goods from finished assembly to shipping. <b>Fork</b> <b>truck</b> drivers are often dedicated to one or two assembly lines in an attempt to meet their every need and to ensure that the assembly process does not incur downtime. This project’s goal was to evaluate the possibility of reducing <b>fork</b> <b>truck</b> usage in the plant by cutting trucks from the fleet, thereby reducing cost. The major areas for improvement found within the plant include a reduction in empty fork trucks, a decrease in time spent searching for parts, and a reduction in unnecessarily long travel times for drivers. Due to a larger production volume and more total trucks, the focus of the project centered on Load Center Assembly’s six fork trucks. The analysis of the current routing system identified changes that were needed in the facility to improve <b>fork</b> <b>truck</b> driver efficiency. In order to do this, new truck routes, storage options, and communication technology were thoroughly investigated. After detailed research and analysis, it was determined that a reduction in fork trucks was possible if the tasks were redistributed correctly. Also, implementing racks in storage areas helps make the drivers more efficient. The recommendation of redistributing tasks and implementing racks met the 2 -year payback requested by Eaton Cutler-Hammer. In order to reduce the usage of fork trucks, the least utilized driver was removed. His tasks were redistributed among the remaining five drivers...|$|E
