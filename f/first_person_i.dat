500|$|Harrison's {{earliest}} musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan {{were significant}} influences. In early 1956 {{he had an}} epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley's [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll. He often sat {{at the back of}} the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, [...] "I was totally into guitars." [...] Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in." ...|$|E
500|$|More recently, IM Hans Berliner, {{a former}} World Champion of Correspondence Chess, claimed in his 1999 book The System that 1.d4 gives White a large, and {{possibly}} decisive, advantage. Berliner asserted that with best play White wins against the Grünfeld Defense, the Modern Benoni, the Benko Gambit and other (unnamed) [...] "major defences", and achieves {{at least a}} large advantage in many lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined. However, he allowed that, [...] "It {{is possible that the}} rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible-appearing defences to 1.d4 can be refuted." [...] Berliner wrote that Adams' [...] "theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met who actually had theories about how chess should be played." ...|$|E
2500|$|White {{claimed to}} have found {{inspiration}} for his first murder while watching RoboCop 2: [...] "The first girl I killed was from a 'RoboCop' movie... I seen him cut somebody's throat then take the knife and slit down the chest to the stomach and left the body in a certain position. With the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> killed I did exactly what I saw in the movie." ...|$|E

Weaver W. Adams was the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met who actually had theories about how chess should be played."

2500|$|Eventually, actors Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law {{were cast}} to replace Heath Ledger in certain scenes, portraying the new idea of {{transformed}} versions of Ledger's character travelling through magical realms, while the footage shot with Ledger {{would remain in}} the film as his character's [...] "real-world" [...] appearance. Gilliam told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Then we made the quantum leap: What if we get three actors to replace him? [...] Johnny was the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> called. He said, 'Done. I'm there.' Same with Jude and Colin." [...] Depp, a friend of Gilliam's who starred in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the aborted The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, had been compared to Ledger by cinematographer Nicola Pecorini. Law was also a friend of Ledger's and had been considered {{for the role of}} Tony, and Farrell had also been friends with Ledger.|$|E
2500|$|Sevag Balikci, [...] a Turkish {{soldier of}} Armenian descent, {{was shot dead}} on April 24, 2011, {{the day of the}} {{commemoration}} of the Armenian Genocide during his military service in Batman. It was later discovered that killer Kıvanç Ağaoğlu was an ultra-nationalist. Through his Facebook profile, it was uncovered that he was a sympathizer of nationalist politician Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and Turkish agent / contract killer Abdullah Çatlı, who himself had a history of anti-Armenian activity, such as the Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing in a Paris suburb in 1984. His Facebook profile also showed that he was a Great Union Party (BBP) sympathizer, a far-right nationalist party in Turkey. Testimony given by Sevag Balıkçı's fiancée stated that he was subjected to psychological pressure at the military compound. She was told by Sevag over the phone that he feared for his life because a certain military serviceman threatened him by saying, [...] "If war were to happen with Armenia, you would be the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> would kill." ...|$|E

So far as I remember, my only request, when I gave you your liberty and half my income, was that your friendship with the Draconmeyers should decrease.

2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E

6000|$|I {{returned}} to the house where the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> met was Lord Ragnall himself, just arrived from some interview about the fifty Snider rifles, which were still in bond.

60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{saw there}} was Mr. Shelmardine. He was sitting right {{across from me}} and a smile glimmered in his eyes. I {{did not look at}} him again. Through the service I was subdued enough to have {{satisfied}} even Aunt Martha.|$|E

60|$|Towards sunset {{that evening}} I stood {{again on the}} well-remembered terrace, and looked once more at the {{peaceful}} old country house. The gardener was the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> saw in the deserted grounds. He had left Betteredge, an hour since, sunning himself in the customary corner of the back yard. I knew it well; and I said I would go and seek him myself.|$|R
6000|$|Thereupon the {{assembly}} broke up, and I rode back to Bonaventure, reaching {{it with the}} first of the daylight, blackened and singed, while, as it happened, Lucille Haldane was the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met.

60|$|I had {{no sooner}} ridden {{out of the}} forest shade when I saw that the place was in an uproar, men and women {{gathering}} in groups and running here and there between the cabins.

60|$|I must beg {{allowance}} {{to use the}} <b>first</b> <b>person</b> singular. <b>I</b> cannot, {{like old}} Weller, spell myself with a We. Ours is, I believe, the only language that has shown so much sense of the worth of the individual (to himself) as to erect the first personal pronoun {{into a kind of}} votive column to the dignity of human nature. Other tongues have, or pretend, a greater modesty.|$|R
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> saw, to my surprise, by the sober {{light of}} the shaded lamp, was Uriah. He was {{standing}} close beside it, {{with one of his}} skeleton hands over his mouth, and the other resting on the Doctor's table. The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, was leaning forward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm.|$|R
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met on {{the pier}} was Rectus. He had had his supper, and had come down to watch for me. I was so angry that I would not speak to him. He kept by my side, though, as I {{walked up to the}} house, excusing himself for going off and leaving me.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{addressed}} was a Kawwas[FN#6] {{or police}} officer, who, coiled comfortably up {{in a bit}} of shade fitting his person like a robe, was in full enjoyment of the Asiatic [...] "Kayf."

60|$|INSPECTOR THEAKSTONE--Your {{letter and}} {{inclosure}} came safe to hand. Wise men, they say, may always learn something {{even from a}} fool.

In half an hour's time I was at the house. The <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> saw there was Mr. Sharpin himself.|$|E
2500|$|Rochester's enemy Lord Halifax {{called for}} an inquiry into Rochester's {{stewardship}} of the finances and {{it was found that}} £40,000 had been lost by mismanagement. As a consequence Rochester was, in August 1684, removed from office and given the post Lord President of the Council, a more dignified but less lucrative and important office. Halifax said: [...] "I have seen people kicked down stairs but my Lord Rochester is the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> that <b>I</b> ever saw kicked up stairs".|$|R
25|$|In many western, {{northern}} and southwestern Norwegian dialects {{and in the}} western Danish dialects of Thy and Southern Jutland, æ has a significant meaning: the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> singular pronoun <b>I.</b> It is thus a normal spoken word and is usually written æ when such dialects are rendered in writing.|$|R
