5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a {{civil war}} between the Parthians later took place, which gave him the {{opportunity}} to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with <b>friendliness,</b> gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome. Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by Asinnalus.|$|E

5|$|The natives' {{relationship}} with the sailors is initially cordial, so Too-Wit and the captain begin trading. Their <b>friendliness,</b> however, {{turns out to be}} a ruse and on the eve of the ship's proposed departure, the natives ambush the crew in a narrow gorge. Everyone except Pym and Peters is slaughtered, and the Jane Guy is overrun and burned by the malevolent tribe.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Travers is {{irritated by}} what she {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive <b>friendliness,</b> personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and <b>friendliness</b> as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental <b>friendliness.</b> LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff's <b>friendliness</b> {{toward other}} {{characters}} varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers {{him to be}} the prime example of an outstandingly good driver. Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is treated with respect by her in spite of his slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the <b>friendliness</b> of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His <b>friendliness</b> may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Skorokhodov, {{yet another}} of the guards, smuggled in a {{birthday}} cake to celebrate Maria's nineteenth birthday on June 26, 1918. Maria slipped away from the group with Ivan Skorokhodov for a private moment and they were discovered together in a compromising position when two of his superiors conducted a surprise inspection of the house. Skorokhodov was removed from his position after his actions and <b>friendliness</b> towards the grand duchess were discovered by his commanding officers. In their memoirs, several guards reported that both the Tsarina and her older sister Olga appeared angry with Maria {{in the days following}} the incident and that Olga avoided her company. After this incident, a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the officers and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more strict.|$|E
5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost <b>friendliness</b> or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see everything and everyone in black and white.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive <b>friendliness</b> and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate <b>friendliness.</b> However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere <b>friendliness,</b> and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, {{during the}} {{struggle}} of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to seduce the Popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall {{into a state of}} dependence from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In spite of his <b>friendliness</b> towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of Augustus by the Popes. And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, the Pope refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.* J. W. Birkenmeier, The Development of the Komnenian Army, 114 Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches have remained divided.|$|E

25|$|By 1992, Mustaine's vocal {{performance}} and style, along with Megadeth's bombastic aesthetic, were considered jarring by some music listeners, meaning {{they had not}} yet been exposed to more mainstream audiences.
