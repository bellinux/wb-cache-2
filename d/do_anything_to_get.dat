25|$|Slytherin house values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness; the Sorting Hat said in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that Slytherins will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their way. The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and {{the house}} colours are green and silver. Salazar Slytherin founded the house. The Head of House is Severus Snape until the seventh book. Then, Horace Slughorn, the {{previous}} Head of House, comes out of retirement re-assuming authority after Snape becomes headmaster. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody Baron. According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book as having a greenish glow.|$|E
25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had said he would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> custody of his grandson, but {{that the only way}} that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

500|$|The St. Paul Pioneer Press {{observed}} that Gothel represents [...] "an update" [...] {{of the traditional}} wicked stepmother, evolving into [...] "the passive-aggressive stepmother" [...] instead. In actress Donna Murphy's opinion, a [...] "classic" [...] villainess is [...] "somebody who wants something with such intensity and such great need but comes {{to a place of}} not being bound by any kind of moral code or any sense of what’s ethical", concluding that [...] "They will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what they want". [...] The Austin Chronicle {{observed that}} the directors' inclusion of Gothel as [...] "an evil mother figure as a trigger for the storyline" [...] remains one of the [...] "classic hallmarks of Disney animation". According to Kay Turner, author of the book Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms, [...] "Gothel" [...] means [...] "godmother" [...] in German.|$|E

[...] When Charlie arrests Darryl for kissing her, Stephen quipped: [...] "That woman will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a guy in handcuffs." [...] All About Soap said Charlie and Darryl's chemistry was [...] "clear for everyone to see" [...] and wondered when she would stop hiding behind her [...] "law-abiding facade". When Charlie and Darryl share their [...] "steamy moment", Erin Miller of TV Week said [...] "It was the moment we've all been waiting for." [...] In 2012, Stephen questioned whether there was another police officer who has had [...] "such a difficult life as Charlie". She said she transformed from [...] "lesbian to gangster's moll" [...] and opined that her life continued to [...] "spiral out of control".|$|E
500|$|... "The Other Woman" [...] {{contains}} Jack and Juliet's second kiss. [...] Juliet {{was conceived}} by the writers {{as the next}} possible love interest for Jack {{after the death of}} the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). [...] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic story arc. [...] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because [...] "they needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed someone to come in and be a little salt in the oyster of Jack and Kate." [...] She believes that Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack, but not knowing whether [...] "her attraction to Jack or her willingness to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off the island" [...] is more important to her. [...] Juliet forms something of a [...] "love rectangle" [...] with Jack, Kate and Sawyer. [...] Mitchell [...] "feel like [...] a very grown-up relationship. [...] They seem to really respect and like each other", whereas Sawyer and Kate are like [...] "rambunctious teenagers". [...] The couple has gained an Internet fandom and been given the portmanteau nickname [...] "Jacket".|$|E

5000|$|Joan Swirsky, a New York-based {{journalist}} and author, wrote in 2003: [...] "Another example that feminism is dead is {{the popularity of}} Sex and the City, the HBO show that features 30- and 40-something women sending out the unmistakable messages to females both younger and older that careers, money, looks and, ostensibly, intelligence are nothing compared <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a man, including endlessly obsessing about the subject, engaging in loveless or even like-less sexual encounters." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements {{played a}} song called [...] "Kids Don't Follow". Jesperson was {{convinced}} the song sounded like a hit and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, [...] "I will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this out.

2500|$|Whereas The JAMs' {{earlier work}} sampled {{prominently}} and illegally {{from the popular}} works of established artists, The KLF's international reputation allowed their later releases to feature guest vocals from such established performers as Tammy Wynette (for [...] "Justified and Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)", Gary Glitter (for [...] "Doctorin' the Tardis") and Glenn Hughes (for [...] ""). [...] Drummond has expressed disgust at this notion in his book 45. [...] In a chapter written in 1998, Drummond professes to have [...] "worshipped" [...] Wynette's voice, yet he nevertheless says, [...] "The whole British tradition of 'young' white artists dragging up some [...] legend to perform with is an evil and corrupt exchange; the young artist wanting {{to tap into the}} mythical status and credibility of the has-been, the has-been wanting some of that 'I'm still contemporary, relevant (and will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back into the charts)' stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dig 'em was {{replaced}} by an animal more associated with honey, Wally the Bear, in 1986 (1984 in France).

Abstinence from anything is cool, because the normalcy of life is deceptive: It's enjoyable for a while, and there are good moments, but sometimes that's not enough. You start questioning what's the point. By not opening my mouth I was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into that state. Jack called me at the end of it; he couldn't understand what I was saying.
