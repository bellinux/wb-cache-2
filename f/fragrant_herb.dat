2500|$|To die for Emperor and Nation is {{the highest}} hope of a {{military}} man. After a brave hard fight the blossoms are scattered on the fighting field. But if a person wants to take a life instead, still the fighting man will go to eternity for Emperor and country. One man's life or death {{is a matter of}} no importance. All that matters is the Empire. As Confucius said, [...] "They may crush cinnabar, yet they do not take away its color; one may burn a <b>fragrant</b> <b>herb,</b> yet it will not destroy the scent."

60|$|They {{rubbed the}} arm with sweet oil; while the old servant {{brought in a}} bundle of rue from the garden, which, being bruised in a mortar, filled {{the room with a}} fresh, {{aromatic}} smell. With this <b>fragrant</b> <b>herb</b> she made a cooling cataplasm. Having dressed my arm, they placed it in a sling, then in place of my coat a light Indian poncho was brought for me to wear.|$|E
60|$|The {{family were}} at tea; the <b>fragrant</b> <b>herb</b> {{filled the room}} with its aroma; the brown toast was odoriferous; and {{everything}} pleasant and charming. After a temporary warming, I was shown to a room, where I changed my wet dress, an returning to the table, found that the interval had been we improved by my hostess; a meal for a traveler was spread and I laid into it sturdily. Every mouthful pushed the devil that had been tormenting me all day farther and farther out of me, till at last I entirely ejected him with three successive bowls of Bohea.|$|E

60|$|Such {{were a few}} of the {{reflections}} which I mingled with my ale, as I remember to have seen an old quaffer of that excellent liquor stir up his cup with a sprig of some bitter and <b>fragrant</b> <b>herb.</b> Meanwhile I found myself still haunted by a desire to get a definite result out of my visit to Uttoxeter. The hospitable inn was called the Nag's Head, and standing beside the market-place, was as likely as any other to have entertained old Michael Johnson in the days when he used to come hither to sell books. He, perhaps, had dined on bacon and greens, and drunk his ale, and smoked his pipe, in the very room where I now sat, which was a low, ancient room, certainly much older than Queen Anne's time, with a red-brick floor, and a white-washed ceiling, traversed by bare, rough beams, the whole in the rudest fashion, but extremely neat. Neither did it lack ornament, the walls being hung with colored engravings of prize oxen and other pretty prints, and the mantel-piece adorned with earthen-ware figures of shepherdesses in the Arcadian taste of long ago. Michael Johnson's eyes might have rested on that selfsame earthen image, to examine which more closely I had just crossed the brick pavement of the room. And, sitting down again, still as I sipped my ale, I glanced through the open window into the sunny market-place, and wished that I could honestly fix on one spot rather than another, as likely to have been the holy site where Johnson stood to do his penance.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout 1938, {{many young}} army and naval {{officers}} {{began to speak}} publicly against Yamamoto and certain other Japanese admirals such as Mitsumasa Yonai and Shigeyoshi Inoue for their strong opposition to a tripartite pact with Nazi Germany as they saw it as inimical to [...] "Japan's natural interests." [...] Yamamoto received {{a steady stream of}} hate mail and death threats from Japanese nationalists. His reaction to the prospect of death by assassination was passive and accepting. The admiral wrote:To die for Emperor and Nation is the highest hope of a military man. After a brave hard fight the blossoms are scattered on the fighting field.

40|$|Cyperus platycaulis {{is used in}} folk {{medicine}} in Kano, northern Nigeria, {{for the treatment of}} cold, cough, (tuberculosis), chest congestion, asthma, sneezing, and catarrh. The tuberous <b>fragrant</b> <b>herb</b> (black species) was extracted using ethanol, chloroform, n-butane, and n-hexane, to determine the physico-chemical properties of the plant and the cytotoxicity of the extracts with reference to its anti-bacterial (anti-tuberculea) properties. Fractionation of the crude compounds followed by phytochemical screening, anti-cholinesterase (enzyme estimation) activity, and inhibition of sheep liver by the extracts are reported. Ethanol and n-butane extracts were positive for nearly all bioactive compounds tested. Chloroform and n-hexane extracts were both negative for carbohydrates, tannins, and glycosides. Alkaloids were completely absent. Cholinesterase inhibition of the extracts was encouraging. The order of ChE inhibition, (percentage inhibition of ChE over control) from highest to least was FE 001 (72. 4 %),> FC 001 (66. 5 %),> FB 001 (66. 2 %), and>FH 001 (60. 3 %). This correlates ethnomedical claims and thus provides for the first time, the pharmacological basis for the folkloric usage of Cyperus platycaulis as a potential cure for tuberculosis in Kano State, Northern Nigeria...|$|E

50|$|Likewise, English {{pleasure}} grounds {{were influenced}} by medieval groves, {{some of which were}} still in existence in 18th century Britain. This influence manifest in the form of shrubbery, sometimes organized in mazes or maze-like formations. And though also ancient, shredding became a common characteristic of these early gardens, as the method enabled light to enter the understory. Shredding was used to make garden groves, which ideally included an orchard with fruit trees, <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs</b> and flowers, and moss-covered pathways.|$|R
50|$|In the {{old growth}} {{forests of the}} Borino Municipality there is an {{abundance}} of wild fruits which have thrived for centuries in the Rhodope Mountains - wild blueberries, wild strawberries, raspberries, and rose hips.

60|$|On {{the broad}} bosom of a sunny hill, behind which rose a pyramid of bare rock, {{was a most}} {{beautiful}} village--flat cottages with terraced roofs, shaded by spreading trees, and surrounded by fruit and flowers.

60|$|Such was {{the vague}} {{whirling}} memory still lingering in Nigel's mind {{when at last}} the mists cleared away from it {{and he found himself}} weak but clear on the low couch in the corner turret. Beside him, crushing lavender betwixt his rough fingers and strewing it over floor and sheets, was Aylward the archer. His longbow leaned {{at the foot of the}} bed, and his steel cap was balanced on the top of it, while he himself, sitting in his shirt sleeves, fanned off the flies and scattered the <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs</b> over his helpless master.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, bathing had {{declined}} in England. As people got smellier, {{the use of}} <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs</b> became more popular. They were used {{in all areas of}} the house, including kitchens, dining halls and bedrooms. The herbs were laid on the floor along with reeds, rushes, or straw, so that pleasant odours would be released when people walked on them. Certain plants would also help keep pests such as fleas at bay. In a typical medieval English monastery, for instance, the floor of the dormitory would have been strewn with rushes that were swept and replaced once or twice a year.|$|R

50|$|While the Iban {{constitute}} the largest Dayak subgroup {{as well as}} the most populous ethnic group in Sarawak, much of the ethnic Iban population is still concentrated away from Sarawak's main urban areas, congregating instead within longhouse communities scattered all over the interior regions of the state. The traditional cookery of the Iban is called pansoh or pansuh, which is the preparation and cooking of food in bamboo tubes. Ingredients like poultry, fish, pork, vegetables or rice are mixed with <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs</b> like lemongrass, tapioca leaves and bungkang leaves (a species of myrtle from the Eugenia genus), then sealed within the bamboo tubes and placed directly over an open fire. Cooking food this way will infuse it with aroma and flavour from the bamboo tubes while keeping it moist.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to the dry}} {{nature of}} the Achomawi's land, deer was not always abundant, hence their unique way of hunting deer {{compared}} to other Californian Natives America. A deep pit would be dug along a deer trail, covered with brush, the trail restored including adding deer tracks using a hoof, and all dirt and human evidence taken away. The settlers' cattle would also fall in these pits, {{so much so that}} the settlers convinced the people to stop this practice. The pits were most numerous near the river because the deer came down to drink and so the river is named for these trapping pits. Deer hunting was always preceded by ritual. Rituals also existed that did not involve the hunting process but involved the avoidance of deer meat. Adolescent girls would stuff their nostrils with <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs</b> to avoid smelling venison being cooked while going through their maturity ceremony.|$|R
50|$|Although a {{great deal}} was {{destroyed}} {{at the time of}} the Dissolution of the Monasteries, there is still much to see. The groundplan of the 102 metre long church can be seen on the lawns. The position of the altar is marked by a cross and flanking trees. The Domus, once the lay brothers' refectory and lodgings and, later, chambers for important guests once the lay brothers had vanished, now houses an exhibition of monastic life prior to Thomas Wriothesley's takeover. Visitors can view a series of modern embroidered wall hangings made by Belinda, Lady Montagu, depicting scenes from medieval monastic life and the history of the abbey since 1204. The abbey refectory survives as the parish church and there are substantial ruins of the other buildings round the cloister.

5000|$|In 1903, {{the renowned}} chef Auguste Escoffier noted that dishes labeled aux fines herbes were {{sometimes}} being made with parsley alone. In his Culinary Guide, Escoffier insisted that:It {{is a mistake}} to serve, under the name Omelette aux fines herbes, an omelet in which chopped parsley furnishes the only aromatic note. This error is too widespread for us to hope to overturn it. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that an omelette aux fines herbes must contain: parsley, chives, and a little chervil and tarragon. Thirty-five years later, under the entry [...] "Fines Herbes", the authoritative Larousse Gastronomique of 1938 conceded that, generally speaking, an Omelette aux fines herbes was still most frequently being seasoned only with chopped parsley, but repeated Escoffier's admonition that it ought to contain a combination of <b>fragrant</b> <b>herbs,</b> [...] "such as, parsley, chervil, tarragon, and also chives." [...] For in former times this was the traditional practice (la pratique ancienne), when [...] "to the aforementioned herbs, chopped mushrooms, and even truffles, would be added." ...|$|R
