40|$|Equilibrium points, {{primary and}} {{secondary}} static bifurcation branches, and periodic orbits with their bifurcations of discrete systems under partial follower forces and no initial imperfections are examined. Equilibrium points are computed by solving sets of simultaneous, non-linear algebraic equations, whilst periodic orbits are determined numerically by solving 2 - or 4 -dimensional non-linear boundary value problems. A specific application is given with Ziegler's 2 -DOF cantilever model. Numerous, complicated static bifurcation paths are computed as well as complicated series of periodic orbit bifurcations of relatively large periods. Numerical simulations indicate that chaotic-like transient motions of the system may appear when a <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> increases above the divergence state. At these <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> values, there co-exist numerous branches of bifurcating periodic orbits of the system; it is conjectured that sensitive dependence on initial conditions due to {{the large number of}} co-existing periodic orbits causes the chaotic-like transients observed in the numerical simulations.

The aims of this study were to examine associations among ground reaction <b>force</b> <b>parameters</b> in an STS movement and isokinetic knee and ankle strength and power in healthy older adults, and to compare associations with the five-times STS test. MethodsThe following five ground reaction <b>force</b> <b>parameters</b> were measured in 19 men and 28 women: peak reaction force, two rate of <b>force</b> development (RFD) <b>parameters</b> and two time-related parameters.

The influence of surface effects, the Casimir force and the fringing field effects on the pull-in parameters is investigated. The results demonstrate that the Casimir force decreases the pull-in deflection and voltage, the fringing field effects increase the pull-in deflection and decrease the pull-in voltage. The critical value of the surface effect parameter decreases monotonically from η∗= 4 as the Casimir <b>force</b> <b>parameter</b> increases.

The {{aim of this}} experimental study was {{to find the most}} efficient visual {{force feedback}} method to acquire these skills. Retention and transfer validity to an untrained task were assessed. Methods Medical students without prior experience in laparoscopy were randomized in three groups: Constant Force Feedback (CFF) (N = 17), Bandwidth Force Feedback (BFF) (N = 16) and Fade-in Force Feedback (N = 18). All participants performed a pretest, training, post-test and follow-up test. The study involved two dissimilar tissue manipulation tasks, one for training and one to assess transferability. Participants performed six trials of the training task. A force platform was used to record several <b>force</b> <b>parameters.</b> Results A paired-sample t test showed overall lower <b>force</b> <b>parameter</b> outcomes in the post-test compared to the pretest (p <. 001). A week later, the <b>force</b> <b>parameter</b> outcomes were still significantly lower than found in the pretest (p <. 005). Participants also performed the transfer task in the post-test (p <. 02) and follow-up (p <. 05) test with lower <b>force</b> <b>parameter</b> outcomes compared to the pretest.

This provides a flexible modelling framework for approximation of nonlinear situations, while allowing the models to be amenable to algorithmic simplification. The degree of simplification {{is controlled by}} a user-specified <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> lambda.

The linear LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is utilised for the simplification process because of its ability to deal with linear constraints in the over-parameterised initial model.

The bifurcations for positive <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> F are investigated. The main analytical result is the existence of Hopf or Hopf-Hopf bifurcations in any dimension n≥ 4. Exploiting the circulant structure of the Jacobian matrix enables us to reduce the first Lyapunov coefficient to an explicit formula from which it can be determined when the Hopf bifurcation is sub- or supercritical. The first Hopf bifurcation for F> 0 is always supercritical and the periodic orbit born at this bifurcation has the physical interpretation of a travelling wave. Furthermore, by unfolding the codimension two Hopf-Hopf bifurcation it is shown to act as an organising centre, explaining dynamics such as quasi-periodic attractors and multistability, which are observed in the original Lorenz- 96 model. Finally, the region of parameter values beyond the first Hopf bifurcation value is investigated numerically and routes to chaos are described using bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents.

The proportional constant A varies from 0. 2 to 0. 4 in the HD regime as the turbulence <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> b increases from 1 / 3 (purely solenoidal forcing) to 1 (purely compressive forcing). It is also discussed that the parameter A is lowered {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the physical characteristics of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to assess which properties are most important in determining the efficiency of a GHG. Chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen fluorides, and various other known atmospheric trace molecules {{have been included in}} this study. Compounds containing the halogens F or Cl have in common very polar X-F or X-Cl bonds, particularly the X-F bonds. It is shown that as more F atoms bond to the same central atom, the bond dipoles become larger {{as a result of the}} central atom becoming more positive. This leads to a linear increase in the total or integrated XF bond dipole derivatives for the molecule, which leads to a non-linear (quadratic) increase in infrared (IR) intensity. Moreover, virtually all of the X-F bond stretches occur in the atmospheric IR window as opposed to X-H stretches, which do not occur in the atmospheric window. It is concluded that molecules possessing several F atoms will always have a large radiative <b>forcing</b> <b>parameter</b> in the calculation of their global warming potential. Some of the implications for global warming and climate change are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{a strong}} debate {{has emerged in}} the hydrologic {{literature}} regarding what constitutes an appropriate framework for uncertainty estimation. Particularly, there is strong disagreement whether an uncertainty framework should have its roots within a proper statistical (Bayesian) context, or whether such a framework {{should be based on}} a different philosophy and implement informal measures and weak procedures to summarize parameter and predictive distributions. In this paper, we compare a formal Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) for assessing uncertainty in conceptual watershed modeling. Our formal Bayesian approach is implemented using the recently developed DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) MCMC scheme with a likelihood function that explicitly considers model structural, input and parameter uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that DREAM and GLUE can generate very similar estimates of total streamflow uncertainty. This suggests that formal and informal Bayesian approaches have more common ground than the hydrologic literature and ongoing debate might suggest. The main advantage of formal approaches is, however, that they attempt to disentangle the effect of <b>forcing,</b> <b>parameter</b> and model structural error on total predictive uncertainty. This is key to improving hydrologic theory and to better understand and predict the flow of water through catchments...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Lack of {{accuracy}} and uniformity of impact {{have been the}} limitations of the ancient and current methods of potentization. Non-standardized electromechanical potentizers are in use across industry. It is very important that within each manufacturing process, the number of succussions should remain constant as well as the impact given (force exerted) is quantified. The author proposes to give importance to the <b>force</b> <b>parameters</b> in potentization and quantify the impact of potentization. Materials and Methods: The author develops electromechanical potentizer with certain specifications such as arm length, weight, and angle at which the arm drops at the base. The machine was operated with specific instructions given in the machine operation manual. The <b>force</b> <b>parameters</b> were calculated and standardized. Results: Torque is measured to quantify the impact of the force applied in potentization. The magnitude of torque is to be calculated by the force applied, length of the lever arm connecting the axis to the point of force application, and angle between the force vector and the lever arm. In this case, torque was calculated to be = 40. 43 Nm. Since ten strokes are given, torque applied at every potency is calculated as 40. 43. Conclusion: Necessity for the documentation of <b>force</b> <b>parameters</b> used in the process of potentization has been identified, and a tool is developed to demonstrate it...|$|R
