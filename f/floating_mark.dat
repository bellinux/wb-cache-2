40|$|Knowledge of {{temperature}} distributions on streams and lakes {{is considered to}} be a valuable source of information for a wide range of disciplines such as ecologists, hydrologists and geochemists, as it can provide insights into the dynamics of these water bodies (Westhoff, 2006). Modeling of surface water temperature on the other hand is a complex process requiring coupling of spatial and hydrological data (Boyd, Kasper, 2003). At local scales, all influences of the landscape to the water temperature are considered important, even those which are too difficult to quantify. High resolution terrain data can compensate landscape influences by providing insight in the thermal effects of direct solar radiation (by shadow modeling) and longwave radiation (by modeling of ‘Sky View Coefficient’, SVC). Usually, the demand on high resolution terrain data is translated into increased costs during acquisition. As a result, scientists interested in temperature distribution along streams are forced to make a compromise between costs and more detailed temperature modeling. Photogrammetry employed from an aerostat platform is proposed as an inexpensive technique, able at providing terrain data of centimeter level accuracy and resolution. The applicability of the proposed method was tested on a first order stream located in Maisbich subcatchment in central Luxembourg, where temperature modeling experiments are taking place. A 10 x 10 cm digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted using photogrammetric principles for the upstream and downstream part of the subcatchment. The accuracy of the derived DEM was assessed using ground truth points measured by a total station and points collected using the <b>floating</b> <b>mark</b> principle. The resulted height root mean squared error was found 7 cm for the upstream and 6. 44 cm for the downstream part having the ground truth points as reference, and 8. 34 cm and 23. 14 cm having the <b>floating</b> <b>mark</b> points as reference. The DEM served as a basis for information extraction relevant to the temperature distribution model. The influence of shadow in the stream temperature was modeled using hillshade and viewshed algorithms. The SVC was modeled by using upward looking viewshed algorithms. The resulted data were imported in the temperature model. An improvement of 0. 0727 °C was observed when compared to the temperature output using data from a coarser DEM (5 x 5 meters).

40|$|Digital Photogrammetry {{has caused}} a {{revolution}} in the cartographic world thanks to a simplification of the photogrammetric systems. This fact, along with the ever greater need for fast and precise cartography, has increased the number of potential digital photogrammetric users. Despite the simplification of these systems, it still important {{to take into account the}} high necessary investment of digital photogrammetric systems, particularly for sporadic users. Accordingly, it is fundamental that low-cost systems are developed which incorporate at least some of the tasks of need to initial users. These tasks could, basically, be limited to the extraction of information from images previously oriented (monoscopic and stereoscopically) and the generation of orthoimages, like such as basic documents on which to support another type of works. The STEREOVISOR system has been developed specifically with this idea in mind. STEREOVISOR is a digital photogrammetric workstation designed to provide maximum benefits for a low cost. The hardware incorporates a stereoscopic vision system by means of anaglyphs and the <b>floating</b> <b>mark</b> movement is controlled using a conventional mouse. The system incorporates several functions: a) project management; b) stereoscopic vision; c) vector information extraction, from previously oriented images as maps; d) orthoimage generation. Potential users are basically university and educational centers, governmental agencies and companies that actually are photogrammetric products customers. Such users could receive the oriented images and the program so that they can extract such information as may be of interest whenever they want. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using pre-defined {{models to}} extract spatial {{information}} of the building, called model-based building extraction, {{has been considered}} as a convincible approach to improve the existing photogrammetric techniques. However, {{there is still a}} bottleneck on the practical efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposed a semi-automated approach to extracting buildings from multiple aerial images as well as close-range images by a tailored least-squares model-image fitting (LSMIF) algorithm. Compare to the <b>floating</b> <b>mark</b> which is used by conventional photogrammetric techniques, we proposed a naval measuring tool of “floating models ” for building extraction. The floating model is an abstract representation of the real object, which can be a point, a line segment, a surface plane, or a volumetric model. Each floating model is associated with a set of pose parameters and a set of shape parameters. By fitting the model to images, these parameters will not only reveal the location of the building but also describe the shape of the building. The semi-automated strategy for building extraction includes following five steps: (1) manually select an appropriate model, (2) manually locate and adjust the model for approximate fitting, (3) automatically compute the optimal fitting, (4) manually edit, and (5) compose the fitted models according to the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). An ad hoc computer program which was developed to implementing the proposed semi-automated approach was tested by extracting 10 selected buildings around the NCKU campus. The accuracy achieved was evaluated by comparing the roof corner coordinates with manual measurements. 1...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} photogrammetric multi-station panorama processing for the 3 -D reconstruction of objects. We cover the complete process from image acquisition, panorama generation by frame imagery and by rotating line-scanner imagery, calibration, tie point and control point measurement, panorama bundle adjustment to the final image compilation of 3 -D objects. The IAPG owns several high-resolution digital cameras, e. g. Kodak DCS 460, Fuji FinePix S 1 Pro and S 2 Pro, Sigma SD 10 and Kodak/Mamiya DCS 645 M. These devices {{can be used for}} panorama image acquisition if a suitable camera mount is used. In this case single image frames can easily be stitched together to a complete or partial panorama under consideration of the strict camera model (calibration parameters). Alternatively, our rotating line-scanner camera KST EyeScan can be used that produces very high resolution images. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages that have been discussed in previous papers. If at least three different panoramas have been generated from different local stations, they can be oriented by bundle adjustment. Due to the stable geometry of the cylindrical panorama model the bundle adjustment can be performed with very few object points. Once each panorama is oriented with respect to global coordinate system, photogrammetric object reconstruction procedures such as space intersection or a moving <b>floating</b> <b>mark</b> can be applied. Two practical examples demonstrate the process of panorama object recording and modeling. The entrance hall of the university has been reconstructed in 3 -D yielding a wireframe model of the interior. For the Great Hall of the Oldenburg castle again four panoramas have been processed whereby special effort has been spent to produce a high-quality color panorama. ...|$|E
