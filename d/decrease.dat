5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> in respiratory rate and a marked <b>decrease</b> in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild <b>decrease</b> in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant <b>decrease</b> in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
