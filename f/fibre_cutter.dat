40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design and}} construction of a <b>fibre</b> <b>cutter</b> {{which can be used}} to chop different types of fibres in order to produce alternative composite materials. Chopped fibre is needed in the production of composite materials for the automotive industry and other sectors. Bulk Moulding Compound (BMC) and Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) are the most commonly used processes. The process uses chopped glass fibre to produce light composite materials. Currently, the market offers many alternatives to quickly cut glass fibre. However, these methods cannot be used with alternative fibres which are more difficult to handle, so a new <b>fibre</b> <b>cutter</b> is needed to cut alternative fibres and produce new materials which can offer lighter, and more sustainable reinforcement alternatives than glass fibre. The chosen solution has been the modification of an existing fibreglass chopper gun, which was able to cut glass fibre at different lengths with its cutting wheels, but could not cut other types of fibres. After the adaption of the conceptual design to the existing chopper gun, the gun arrangement was able to cut carbon fibre successfully, and is also capable of cutting some types of coated rayon fibre. In order to prove the usefulness of this new design, the chopper gun has been used to cut carbon fibre to produce alternative BMC materials, where, remarkably, that the cutting process just needed 72 seconds to produce 475 grams of chopped carbon fibre. These alternative BMC materials have been tested and compared with conventional glass fibre BMC compounds, demonstrating superior mechanical properties and lower density.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measures on the properties of composite boards made from oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) at different density and resin contents. The oil palm empty fruit bunches were obtained from an oil palm plantation and refined using <b>fibre</b> <b>cutter</b> and particle crusher. Hardeners and wax added at 1 % and 3 % during the mixing process. Boards of densities 500, 600 and 700 kg m- 3 produced with resin urea formaldehyde at 10, 12 and 14 % respectively. The boards stored in a conditioning chamber set at 20 ± 2 °C and 65 % relative humidity before undergoing subsequent testing. The testing procedure followed the EN Standard of specifications. The results indicated increases across the board physical and mechanical properties. The highest modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) value achieved in this study were 22. 91 N mm- 2 and 2059. 56 N mm- 2. The highest value for internal bonding (IB) was 0. 98 N mm- 2, for edge and face screw withdrawal the IB were 467. 47 N mm- 2 and 512. 37 N mm- 2. Boards with 700 kg m- 3 density and 14 % resin contents met the requirement in accordance to the established standard. Board with 500 k gm- 3 density and 10 % resin content observed microscopy showe voids in some of the resin-fibre bonding areas at the cross-section of the board. This suggested that moisture somehow penetrated into the board via the open spaces and attacked the linkages existed causing in the low property. Thermogravimetric analysis conducted in the thermal stability of the boards showed maximum rate of decomposition for the OPEFB boards at 380. 83 °C. In conclusion, the board’s density and resin content applied influenced on the boards overall properties...|$|E
