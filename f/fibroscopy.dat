40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The self-expanding {{metallic}} stent (SEMS) {{is widely}} used in the palliative treatment of stenosing esophageal cancer. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows volumetric investigation including virtual endoscopy. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the feasibility of MDCT follow-up of esophageal SEMS and to describe the imaging patterns encountered as well as correlating them with fibroscopic evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients (10 M, mean age 64 years) with esophageal SEMS as a palliative treatment underwent MDCT for recurrent dysphagia (n = 7), chest pain and fever (n = 1) or follow-up without symptoms (n = 5). Patency and esophageal wall patterns were studied and compared with diagnosis by <b>fibroscopy.</b> RESULTS: No metallic artefact related to the SEMS was observed. At the SEMS level, MDCT revealed a tissular lump (n = 1), a thin recurrent layer of tissue (n = 1), extrinsic compression (n = 1), fluid stasis (n = 7) and intussusception of the gastric wall into the SEMS (n = 4). The esophageal wall was analyzed by MDCT (peripheral thickening around the stent (n = 8), tumor overgrowth under or above the SEMS level (n = 8)) and showed tracheal compression (n = 3). At the level of the SEMS, <b>fibroscopy</b> showed tumor recurrence (n = 2), a thin recurrent layer of tissue (n = 1), a distorted SEMS (n = 1) and a tumor overgrowth under or above the SEMS level (n = 6). In comparison with <b>fibroscopy,</b> MDCT satisfactorily diagnosed the SEMS patency in 92 % of cases and the esophageal wall in 73 %. CONCLUSIONS: Morphology, patency of the SEMS and analysis of the esophageal wall can be performed by MDCT with a good degree of accuracy as compared to <b>fibroscopy.</b> In such patients in palliative care, a non-invasive investigation is worth promoting as a first-line procedure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Short Thyromental Distance (TMD; < 5 cm) {{has been}} {{correlated}} with difficult direct intubation in adult patients. Differences in patient characteristics {{may influence the}} incidence of difficult airway intubation, especially in patients with a reduced mandible dimension. We report a case affected by Goldenhar’s syndrome treated for mandibular hypoplasia with difficulties in intubation. Methods: A 25 years old caucasian woman was referred to the Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Salerno, with bilateral Goldenhar’s syndrome, planned for a sandwich osteotomy as “chin-wing” mentoplasty following Triaca technique {{with the aid of}} the tongue traction maneuver in combination with <b>fibroscopy</b> at intubation time. Following Mallampati classification anesthesiologists, before surgery, classified the airways as easy or difficult according to specified criteria. Discussion: The anesthesiologist’s prediction changed from difficult grade 3 to difficult grade 4 at the time of operation, this because the patient had showed a severe reduction of the mandibular length with the tongue position of the tongue which overlapped the epiglottis making very difficult laryngeal glottis view at the intubation time. Efficacy of the “Tongue traction maneuver” in combination with a planned <b>fibroscopy</b> is reported. High risks of dispnea in short mandible patients at the extubation time after mandible surgery for tongue and pharyngeal swelling are also underlined. Conclusions: Anesthesiologists can derive useful information from facial appearance and facial skeleton, by panoramic X-rays of the jaws, X-ray cephalograms and CT scan analysis that enhances the prediction of a difficult airway intubation. Particularly mouth opening limitations and mandibular operations planning with post-operative tongue and pharyngeal swelling and consequent airway obstruction at the extubation time, have to be carefully evaluated. In craniofacial surgery importance of some maneuvers like “tongue traction” in short thyromental distance alone or in addition to <b>fibroscopy</b> for limited mouth opening cases and a “double step intubation” for narrow nasal airway’s are reported...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to suggest the means of an early diagnosis and a conservative management as often as possible. METHODS: Sixteen cases of tracheobronchial ruptures by blunt thoracic trauma were observed over 26 years in 9 regional pediatric centers. RESULTS: There were 12 boys and 4 girls, from ages 1 hour to 17 years. Nine children presented with associated lesions. <b>Fibroscopy</b> established the following diagnosis: 8 tracheal wounds and 8 bronchial wounds. Six children were operated on within 18 hours (on average) after installation of a thoracic drainage. Two lobectomies, 3 ideal tracheal sutures, and 1 bronchial suture were performed. Seven children were treated exclusively by thoracic drainage. Two of them were intubated through the lesion, leading to a transitory endoprothesis accompanied or not by an external thoracic drainage. One infant recovered spontaneously. There were no deaths in this series. Two recurrent postoperative nerve injuries were noted, one of which was a transitory spontaneously resolutive scar bud and one a granuloma treated by laser. Three times, a stenosis occurred after a conservative management. Two were operated on. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheobronchial ruptures in children are rare. An early <b>fibroscopy</b> holds an important place in the approach of this pathology. Treatment is variable, based on thoracic lesions, their tolerance by the child, and associated lesions.

A histopathological classification has recently permitted a major advancement in the understanding of the disease. Case Presentation We report a case of a mixed bronchial papilloma with an unusual endoscopic presentation. The literature was extensively reviewed to ascertain the unusual characteristics of the current case. A 39 -year of age male was referred to our institution for the investigation of a slight hemoptysis. Routine examination was normal. A <b>fibroscopy</b> revealed an unusual feature of the right main bronchus. The lesion was a plane, non-bleeding, non-glistering sub-mucosal proliferation. No enhanced coloration was noticed. Biopsies revealed a mixed solitary bronchial papilloma. In situ HPV hybridization was negative. Endoscopic treatment (electrocautery) was effective with no relapse. Conclusion This lesion contrasts with the data of the literature where papilloma were described as wart-like lesions or cauliflower tumors, with symptoms generally related to bronchial obstruction. We advise chest physicians to be cautious with unusually small swollen lesions of the bronchi that may reveal a solitary bronchial papilloma. Endoscopic imaging can significantly contribute to the difficult diagnosis of SEP by pulmonary physicians and endoscopists. </p...|$|E

The CT enabled us to localise the tumour to be punctured very accurately, whatever its size or topography {{in relation to the}} thoracic wall or mediastinum. It also distinguished necrotic zones within the body of the tumour whose biopsy would lead to false negative results. The sensibility for detecting malign tumours by this method was 83 % for cytology and 90 % when biopsy was associated with cytology by neele aspirate. The specificity was 94 %. A more precise histological diagnosis was correctly suggested by simple cytology in 7 patients (20 %). A tru-cut biopsy enabled histological characterisation in all the neoplastic cases; amongst the benign lesions a specific diagnosis was made on the biopsy in 4 out of 10 cases. There were complications - 9 % overall. None of the pneumothoraces produced required surgical drainage. There were no fatal complications. In conclusion, transthoracic puncture under CT control is a sensitivite method for detecting peripheral malignant tumours and is associated with a low level of complications.

40|$|Flexible <b>fibroscopy</b> is {{the method}} of choice in the {{diagnosis}} of upper airway (UA) pathologies. Some Authors believe {{that it should be}} carried out under local anaesthesia even in children less than one year of age. In this article, the Authors report on their experience with general anaesthesia, using an airway mask that simultaneously allows the flexible endoscope to be inserted and the patient to be ventilated. The study was carried out in the period 2000 - 2001 in 32 subjects, 18 males and 14 females between 2 and 12 months of age who presented different degrees of stridor and dyspnoea. 18 patients were affected by laryngomalacia, 6 presented bilateral paralysis of the vocal cords, 3 had a paralysis of the left vocal cord, 3 were suffering from congenital anomalies of the epiglottis and 2 had normal larynx {{from the point of view}} of morphology and motility. The method described is easy to perform and allows the subglottid area to be carefully evaluated, prolonging, if necessary, procedure time without risking hypoventilation-induced hypoxemia; carrying out the examination on a sedated patient furthermore reduces the likelihood of complications. The Authors therefore recommend that in all infants under one year of age, endoscopy of the upper airways be effected under general anaesthesia with an airway mask, reserving the execution of the same procedure under local anaesthesia to cases involving older children...|$|E
30|$|Results: Our study {{identified}} 295 {{patients who}} underwent a tracheostomy {{for the following}} indications—ventilatory comfort in chronic neuromuscular disorders (n =  141), mechanical ventilation withdrawal in intensive care polyneuropathy (n =  140) and upper airway obstruction (n =  14). The median age {{of the population was}} 62  years (Q 1 49 & Q 3 72), the median BMI was 24.8  kg m 2 (Q 1 21.7 & Q 3 27.8) and the median IGS 2 score was 51 (38 & Q 3 65). The median cannula size of tracheostomy was 8  mm. The procedures were percutaneously performed in 73.6 % of the cases with systematic tracheal <b>fibroscopy,</b> and {{more than a third of}} the cases (38.7 %) were performed by medical resident. The complications rate was 21.7 %, including early complications in the first week in 52.8 % of the cases. 32.6 % of the complications were serious. No risk factors for complications were identified. 141 patients were decannulated with a median time of 31  days (Q 1 17 & Q 3 63). 8.1 % of patients had otolaryngologist follow-up. The overall mortality of the studied population was 30.1 % including mortality related to tracheostomy in 2 patients. The tracheostomy for extended mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with an increase of mechanical ventilation duration before tracheostomy (p <  0.0001), duration of mechanical ventilation (p <  0.0001), length of stay in intensive care unit (p <  0.0001) and mortality rate (p =  0.0003).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chronic hiccup {{is a rare}} but {{potentially}} severe condition, that can be symptomatic {{of a variety of}} diseases, or idiopathic. Many therapeutic interven-tions have been reported, most often as case reports. Among other drugs, baclofen has been suggested as a therapy for chronic hiccup. In a large series of patients, we have evaluated its therapeutic position. In patients with chronic hiccup, defined as hiccup spell or recurring hiccup attacks lasting more than 7 days, investigation of the upper gastro-oesophageal tract (<b>fibroscopy,</b> manometry, and pH monitoring) was systematically performed. Most patients had tried numerous drugs in the past, without success. Baclofen was used as a first treatment in patients without evidence of any gastro-oesophageal disease (n= 17), and was undertaken only after full treatment of such disease (n= 55) had failed to solve the hiccup problem (n= 20). Baclofen has, therefore, been adminis-tered to 37 patients with chronic hiccup (average duration 4. 6 yrs). Baclofen produced a long-term complete resolution (18 cases) or a considerable decrease (10 cases) of hiccups in 28 of the 37 patients. There {{was no significant difference between}} patients with or without gastro-oesophageal disease. We conclude that so-called idiopathic chronic hiccup often results from gastro-oesophageal abnormalities. Also, if controlled studies confirm our encouraging results, baclofen can be a major element in the treatment of chronic hiccup that is idiopathic, or that cannot be helped by treatment of gastro-oesophageal diseases...|$|E
40|$|In a {{group of}} 37 heavy snorers with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA, Group 1) and {{a group of}} 23 heavy snorers without OSA (Group 2) cephalometric indices, ENT indices related to upper airway collapsibility, and nocturnal O 2 {{desaturation}} indices were related to variables from maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume (MEFV and MIFV) curves. The cephalometric indices used were the length and diameter of the soft palate (spl and spd), the shortest distance between the mandibular plane and the hyoid bone (mph) and the posterior airway space (pas). Collapsibility of the upper airways was observed {{at the level of the}} tongue base and soft palate by <b>fibroscopy</b> during a Muller manoeuvre (mtb and msp) and ranked on a five point scale. Sleep indices measured were the mean number of oxygen desaturations of more than 3 % per hour preceded by an apnoea or hypopnoea of more than 10 s (desaturation index), maximal sleep oxygen desaturation, baseline arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O 2) and, in the OSA group, percentage of sleep time with Sa,O 2 < 90 %. The variables obtained from the flow-volume curves were the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory and inspiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 and FIV 1), peak expiratory and peak inspiratory flows (PEF and PIF), and maximal flow after expiring 50 % of the FVC (MEF 50). The mean of the flow-volume variables, influenced by upper airway aperture (PEF, FIV 1) was significantly greater than predicted. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
