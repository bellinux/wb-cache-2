5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous <b>fuses.</b> Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} <b>fuses</b> {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous <b>fuses</b> had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E

5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest <b>fuses</b> were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology.

When the <b>fuse</b> blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the <b>fuse</b> link out of the <b>fuse</b> holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> holder.

5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their <b>fuses</b> ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of <b>fuses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic <b>fuses</b> to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such <b>fuses</b> were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the <b>fuses</b> the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the <b>fuses,</b> but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of <b>fused</b> image displays called hybrid <b>fused</b> displays. Such displays can be created by gradually transforming a <b>fused</b> image computed by one fusion method into another <b>fused</b> image computed by a different fusion method, either in the spatial domain or in another domain. By defining either global image-to-image or local region-toregion mapping(s) between the two key <b>fused</b> displays, sequences of hybrid <b>fused</b> displays can be generated. In this paper we propose a number of global and local inbetweening algorithms which transform pixel-based <b>fused</b> displays into various region-based <b>fused</b> displays. The main motivation behind this research is that while pixel-based <b>fused</b> displays generally provide better situational awareness, region-based <b>fused</b> displays, such as cut-andpaste displays or pseudo-coloured segmentation maps, often lead to better performance in tasks such as target detection and tracking. Having the ability to generate hybrid displays between these two classes is essential for being able to evaluate their perception, performance and usefulness for various tasks in different scenarios and applications...|$|R
