5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the <b>Jewel</b> Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the <b>Jewel</b> Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and the cooking was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor rooms of the <b>Jewel</b> Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The <b>Jewel</b> Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Jewel</b> Tower {{diminished in}} importance; {{probably}} during the 16th century, the palace walls {{on either side}} of the building were demolished, and part of the moat was filled in during 1551. By the 1590s, the tower had begun to be used both for the storage of the Lords' records and as a house for the parliamentary clerk. In 1600, a three-storey timber extension was built on the side of the tower for the clerk's use, as part of a wider renovation of the tower at a cost of £166, and the complex began to be termed the Parliament Office rather than the <b>Jewel</b> Tower. The ground floor of the tower may have begun to be used as a kitchen and scullery for the new house at around this time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Jewel</b> Tower {{was taken}} over by the newly formed Standard Weights and Measures Department in 1869, who used it for storing and testing {{official}} weights and measures. The rising levels of London traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the <b>Jewel</b> Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E
