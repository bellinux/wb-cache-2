The transformed <b>directional</b> <b>spectra</b> are compared with measured spectra using pressure gauge arrays in shallow waters at Marina and Santa Cruz. The classical Longuet-Higgins et al.

This work examines the accuracy and limitations of modeling linear refraction by comparing with field observations over complex bathymetry. In general, linear refraction can give reasonable energy and direction estimates starting with deep water spectra, but notable exceptions can occur. The largest prediction error occurred at Marina on 18 January 1988 for the case f a severe storm. This is presumably due to diffractive and non-linear effects of the high waves causing loss of accuracy. The linear refraction model is not suitable for handling such problems.

FloWave is the world’s first combined current and wave test basin with a circular design that provides the capability to generate waves from all directions. This makes possible the production of realistic site-specific sea states, with no intrinsic limitations on the creation of multidirectional wave fields. In order to do this effectively, real site data must be used and manipulated in order to preserve both the sites characteristics and the directional complexity. A variety of methods are trialled here for reducing a wave buoy dataset to a subset of representative sea states.

40|$|High {{frequency}} surface wave radars are operated as a remote sensor to measure ocean surface parameters to ranges exceeding 200 - 300 km from the coastline. The Bragg {{peaks in the}} power spectrum of backscattered radar electromagnetic signals from ocean waves reveal the Bragg resonant effect and the second order continuum reflect a hydrodynamic and electromagnetic modulation on the radio waves from the ocean waves. The power spectrum is thus utilized to invert the ocean wave <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> by a non-linear integral equation. Further integrations of the ocean wave <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> yield the estimates of wave parameters: significant waveheight, mean wave period, mean direction, directional spread, etc. Beside sea echoes, non-sea echoes or interferences (collectively termed ‘clutter'), are also received by radar antenna receivers and included in the power spectrum. Clutters which occupy the second order continuum are treated as sea echoes in the inverse algorithm and cause inaccurate estimation of the ocean wave <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Thus clutter mitigation is {{the main purpose of}} this thesis and is intensively investigated. A three-step image processing approach is proposed in this thesis which could mitigate visible clutters, e. g. radio frequency interferences and ionospheric interferences, and also invisible clutters. The kernel implements a decomposition of the mixture space and then a projection of the mixture space into a desired subspace. In addition to this main approach, various signal processing methods are also investigated for improving the wave estimates, e. g. wavelet analysis, AR modeling, adaptive filtering algorithm. The clutter mitigation scheme is validated by operational use on a whole month of Pisces data and exhibits some improvements in the accuracy of wave estimates. To aid the operational use, a statistical pattern recognition method is also developed. Finally, the best schemes are chained together for a sequential operational use in terms of providing better wave estimation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The principal objective was to provide a field validation of ERS- 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurement of ocean surface structure. The NASA-P 3 aircraft measurements made during this experiment provide independent measurements of the ocean surface along the validation swath. The Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer (ROWS) is a radar sensor designed to measure direction of the long wave components using spectral analysis of the tilt induced radar backscatter modulation.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of freak wave generation mechanisms has advanced {{and the community}} has reached a consensus that spectral geometry plays an important role. Numerous marine accident cases were studied and revealed that the narrowing of the <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> is a good indicator of dangerous sea.
