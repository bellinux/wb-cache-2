She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed {{to get it out of}} her system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera sounds as though she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>just</b> an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E

60|$|Oh, ay, it {{is nothing}} new. Often, often, in that long past have I given life and honour, place and power for love. Man is {{different}} from woman. She {{is close to the}} immediate and knows only the need of instant things. We know honour above her honour, and pride beyond her wildest guess of pride. Our eyes are far-visioned for star-gazing, while her eyes see no farther than the solid earth beneath her feet, the lover's breast upon her breast, the infant lusty in the hollow of her arm. And yet, such is our alchemy compounded of the ages, woman works magic in our dreams and in our veins, so that more than dreams and far visions and the blood of life itself is woman to us, who, as lovers truly say, is more than all the world. Yet <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>just,</b> else would man not be man, the fighter and the conqueror, treading his red way on the face of all other and lesser life--for, had man not been the lover, the royal lover, he could never have become the kingly fighter.

60|$|For a day's journey {{before we}} came to this lake, and all the three days we were passing by it, and. for six or seven days' march after it, the ground was {{scattered}} with elephants' teeth in such a number as is incredible; and as {{some of them have}} lain there for some hundreds of years, so, seeing the substance of them scarce ever decays, they may lie there, for aught I know, to the end of time. The size of some of them is, it seems, to those to whom I have reported it, as incredible as the number; and I can assure you there were several so heavy as the strongest man among us could not lift. As to number, I question not but there are enough to load a thousand sail of the biggest ships in the world, by which I may be understood to mean that the quantity is not to be conceived of; seeing that as they lasted in view for above eighty miles' travelling, so they might continue as far to the right hand, and to the left as far, and many times as far, for aught we knew; for it seems the number of elephants hereabouts is prodigiously great. In one place in particular we saw the head of an elephant, with several teeth in it, but one of the biggest that ever I saw; the flesh was consumed, to be sure, many hundred years before, and all the other bones; but three of our strongest men could not lift this skull and teeth; the great tooth, I believe, weighed at least three hundredweight; and this was particularly remarkable to me, that I observed the whole skull was as good ivory as the teeth, and, I believe, altogether weighed at least six hundredweight; and though I do not know but, by the same rule, all the bones of the elephant may be ivory, yet I think there <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>just</b> objection against it from the example before me, that then all the other bones of this elephant would have been there as well as the head.|$|E
