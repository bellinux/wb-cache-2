5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated <b>extension</b> <b>program,</b> was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. These programs would help define the new university.|$|E

40|$|A new {{paradigm}} {{is needed in}} <b>extension</b> marketing <b>programs.</b> Attempts to help producers time the market, either through cask sales or futures trading, appear to be of little benefit. Marketing <b>extension</b> <b>programs</b> need to place less emphasis on outlook and futures trading and more emphasis on simple marketing strategies that people really use. An empirical example of strategies for Oklahoma wheat producers shows selling cash wheat at harvest and participating in government programs as the preferred marketing strategy. Implications for <b>extension</b> <b>programs</b> in other states are that <b>extension</b> <b>programs</b> can help producers decide whether to store their grain and whether to participate in farm programs.

5|$|Italy has {{opted to}} extend the Tornado's service life {{at the expense of}} {{alternative}} ground-attack aircraft such as the AMX International AMX; in 2010 a major upgrade and life <b>extension</b> <b>program</b> was initiated, which will provide new digital displays, Link 16 communications capability, night-vision goggles compatibility, and several other upgrades. In the long term, it is planned to replace the Tornado IDS/ECR fleet in Italian service with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, with the final Italian Tornado scheduled to be phased out in 2025.|$|E
5|$|These {{incidents}} {{appear to}} have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made {{for the creation of}} subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls. The <b>extension</b> <b>program</b> in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive Lion Gate, the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Born in North Sydney, New South Wales, Madgwick {{trained as}} a schoolteacher before {{attaining}} degrees in economics and economic history from the University of Sydney and University of Oxford. Appointed as a lecturer at the University of Sydney, Madgwick worked in the school's <b>extension</b> <b>program</b> which gave him experience and interest in adult education. With the onset of World War II, Madgwick and his colleagues proposed an adult education plan for the Australian Army. The government accepted the plan and, from 1941 to 1946, Madgwick served on active duty as Director of the Australian Army Education Service, which provided adult education services to the Army's 250,000 members during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life <b>extension</b> <b>program)</b> or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England <b>extension</b> <b>program</b> was to provide {{opportunities}} for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students would be the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life <b>extension</b> <b>program</b> (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E

40|$|Effectively {{measuring}} short-term impact, {{particularly a}} change in knowledge resulting from <b>extension</b> <b>programming</b> can prove to be challenging.

While the potential interface between clicker technology and <b>extension</b> <b>programming</b> has been regularly hypothesized about, the success of use and stakeholder attitude towards such technology in an extension setting has not been well defined to date. Based on data collected during Iowa Beef Center winter <b>extension</b> <b>programming,</b> clicker-based technology yielded increased participant response rates when compared to hand-written program evaluations. Moreover, the technology effectively monitored change in knowledge and was viewed in an overwhelmingly positive manner by stakeholders.
