500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Overprotected" [...] was {{directed}} by Billie Woodruff and produced under Geneva Films, while choreographed by Brian Friedman. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I just think it says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> before heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Jagger bought [...] "Stargroves", a {{manor house}} and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones {{and several other}} bands {{recorded}} there using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Led Zeppelin, used the mobile studio to record material for the albums Physical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy. Dire Straits, Lou Reed, Bob Marley, Horslips, Fleetwood Mac, Bad Company, Status Quo, Iron Maiden and Wishbone Ash all recorded within the mobile studio. The Who recorded [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] in Stargroves itself. The Rolling Stones mobile studio was also used to record the Deep Purple song, [...] "Smoke on the Water". The lyrics to the song, which they had not intended to release, mention the mobile studio and were intended as a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> almost being {{burned to the ground}} by a nearby fire. In order to rescue the mobile from the first started by a flare gun, the Stones crew had to smash a window and release the parking brake to roll it out of the way. Deep Purple referred to it as the [...] "Rolling truck Stones thing" [...] in the song, stating previously in the song [...] "We all came out to Montreux ... to make records with a mobile." [...] The mobile is currently owned by the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fifth Test Max O'Connell called [...] "over" [...] {{and turned}} to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result he missed Alan Knott {{catching}} Keith Stackpole and {{had to give him}} not out. This was his first over as an umpire in Test cricket and Snow 'could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test', {{and they were able to}} <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. In the Seventh Test Walters had to be stumped twice by Knott off Underwood as he was given not out by Rowan the first time when for 41, but was a few balls later by Max O'Connell on 42. Later in the match Keith Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out by Rowan, Illingworth said the decision [...] "was really unbelievable".|$|E
5000|$|... "The debate {{surrounding}} the burka {{is a serious}} issue which shouldn't be publicly <b>joked</b> <b>about.</b> Rather than <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> we should be having serious dialogue." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{drive me}} mad. It's so serious, it's so tremendously serious, {{and you have}} the heart to make little <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The artist himself conceded to the {{controversial}} {{nature of his}} own creation, while separately <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as a [...] "piece" [...] symbol.|$|R
2500|$|Barnes, in {{his early}} years at Liverpool, {{had to deal with}} racist abuse from {{opposing}} supporters and far-right groups – a photograph was once taken of Barnes, in full Liverpool kit and mid-match, casually backheeling away a banana which had been hurled at him during a derby match with Everton at Goodison Park. He also claimed Liverpool supporters had written to him not to join the club, as well as being abused by opposition players. On occasion he overheard a teammate make a racist remark towards other black players in opposition teams. On one of his first times at Anfield, Barnes claimed that the tea lady had, intentionally or unintentionally served all the players in the lounge tea except from him and he made a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> by asking light heartedly [...] "Is it because I'm black?" [...] At the time, he was only the second black player to play for Liverpool, and the first to have been a regular player. The only other black player to have appeared for Liverpool at the time was Howard Gayle, who played a mere five games for the Reds {{at the beginning of the}} 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fifth Test Max O'Connell {{made the}} worst {{decision}} in the series when he called [...] "over" [...] and turned to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result, he missed Alan Knott catching Keith Stackpole and {{had to give him}} not out. This was his first over in Test cricket and Snow [...] "could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test", {{and they were able to}} <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. Snow had more problems with Lou Rowan, a policeman who was inclined to stand on his authority and retired at the end of the series. In 1972 he wrote The Umpire's Story which was highly critical of the England team, particularly of Illingworth and Snow. It even queried [...] "was John Snow actually grabbed by a spectator who objected to Snow flattening an Australian batsman?" [...] regardless of photographic evidence to the contrary. In return Snow devoted a whole chapter to [...] "Bitter Rows with Umpire Rowan" [...] in his autobiography Cricket Rebel. Rowan in particular warned Snow for his short-pitched bowling and Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth. Snow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling in the Second Test at Perth, but refused to accept that rib-high balls were intimidatory and continued to bowl them. As a result, Snow was given an official warning, which meant that he would not be allowed to bowl if he was warned again. Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said [...] "Now that's a bouncer for you".|$|E
60|$|BERTLEY. No, no, we mustn't <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [Gravely.] I {{do think}} he should be spoken to.|$|E
60|$|Mr. St. Clare laughed; {{but after}} making a few more <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he gave Haley the money he asked for, and Tom had a new master.|$|R
50|$|Later Shaun is seen {{round at}} Harvey and Gadget's flat taking in bongs. Shaun tells the lads what {{happened}} when he saw Smell and then Harvey <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> impersonating Smell and cheering up Shaun.|$|R
5000|$|Buckhorn {{came under}} fire for aiming a twin [...]50 caliber machine gun at {{journalist}} and pretending to shoot them during a military parade and <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. Buckhorn later apologized to military journalist for his joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dont <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> please. I {{scarcely}} {{know how}} I have behaved, {{or what the}} meaning of the whole scene is, yet. Listen. Did you ever suspect that he was--what shall I say?--courting me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--how about them?" [...] {{said the}} lord, showing by the fiery eagerness of his eye, and the {{increased}} redness of his face, that though the matter had been introduced somewhat jocosely, there could not really be any <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Joke!" [...] Mr. Parker repeated. [...] "Precious little <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I {{can assure}} you. I dare say it looked simple enough to you, {{but it was}} really quite a {{complicated}} business. Never mind, Eve has her pearls--and that's the great thing." ...|$|E
50|$|A man who {{had seen}} the footage of the subject remarked {{it looked like a}} {{neighbor}} of his. He <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to the neighbor. The next day when he saw the information on the truck he called in a tip.|$|R
50|$|Kaling devised her stage name after {{discovering}} while doing standup comedy that emcees {{would have trouble}} pronouncing her last name, Chokalingam, and sometimes made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She toured solo {{as well as with}} Craig Robinson before he was on The Office.|$|R
50|$|The main {{theme of}} this program is that a person sitting in the show tells a strange or unusual news and the comedians of the show start <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> by {{pointing}} another comedian of the show {{or in any other}} way.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you people}} only knew how fatally {{easy it is}} to poison some one by mistake, you wouldn't <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Come on, let's have tea. We've got all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence--that's the poison cupboard. The big cupboard--that's right." ...|$|E
60|$|Helen {{expressed}} regret {{and explained}} {{that it was necessary}} to return to the bedside of her father, and so they managed to get away, although Mrs. Throop followed them to the door, inviting them both to come again. She saw no humor in this, though the men had their <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> This {{perpetual}} joking, I believe it's that that's wearing me out. When I {{come to you}} for {{a little}} comfort in circumstances that drive me almost distracted, you want to amuse Mrs. Bowen, and when I ask to be allowed to share in the amusement, you laugh at me! If you don't understand it all, I'm sure I don't." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} four weeks the story haunted Young Thomas like a spectre. Down it would not. Everywhere he went he was <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It {{gathered}} fresh detail every week. Adelia was getting her clothes ready; {{she was to be}} married in seal-brown cashmere; Vinnie Lawrence at Valley Centre was making it for her; she had got a new hat with a long ostrich plume; some said white, some said grey.|$|R
50|$|Patterson is openly gay. He {{first came}} out in the early 1970s, and {{although}} Jim Ross made several <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> on commentary, his sexuality was not acknowledged publicly or in WWE storylines until the season finale of WWE Legends' House, which aired June 12, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Picture Of The Week: Panellists {{are shown}} an image and makes <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{with the image}} {{connected}} to a news story that happened on {{the week of the}} episode's broadcast.

6000|$|They all notice at {{home that}} I am looking worn and haggard. That hideous old maid, Miss Jillgall, had her {{malicious}} welcome ready for me when we met at breakfast this morning: [...] "Dear Helena, what has become of your beauty? One would think you had left it in your room!" [...] Poor deluded Eunice showed her sisterly sympathy: [...] "Don't <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Selina: can't you see that Helena is ill?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dan did {{not know}} whether he ought to kiss her or not, but Mrs. Pasmer did not in the {{abstract}} seem like a very kissing kind of person, and he let himself be guided by this impression, {{in the absence of any}} fixed principle applying to the case. She made some neat remark concerning the probable settlement of the affair with her husband, and began to laugh and <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in a manner that was very welcome to Dan; it did not seem to him that it ought to be treated so solemnly.|$|E
60|$|Rock County {{had been}} the banner Republican county. For years the Democrats of Rock County had met in annual {{convention}} to nominate a ticket which they had not the slightest expectation of electing. There was something pathetic in the habit. It was not faith--it {{was a sort of}} desperation; and yet the Republicans as regularly had their <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> regardless of the pathos presented in the action of a body of men thus fighting a forlorn and hopeless battle. Each year some old-fashioned Democrat dropped away into the grave, and yet the remnant met and nominated a complete ticket, and voted for it solemnly, even religiously.|$|E
50|$|In {{an early}} 2012 interview, Jason {{mentions}} {{he had been}} under chemotherapy during the recordings of the 2012 Spiritualized album Sweet Heart Sweet Light. He does not specify the diagnosis for this treatment, but he <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> saying that these are drugs he does not recommend to anybody.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first episode}} {{includes}} a nude scene by Ricardo [...] "Chino" [...] Darín, {{who plays a}} rugby player. This was the first scene of male full frontal nudity aired on Argentine television in almost 60 years. The writer, Javier Van de Couter, <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> on social networks, generating many responses.|$|R
5000|$|... “When I first arrived, I {{made quite}} {{inappropriate}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> going, 'I've never had only white friends before'. Growing up in Canada, you're {{growing up with}} a girl from Tokyo, a girl from Korea and a Jewishgirl. So it's just different. That's the most immediate thing my sister notices." [...] Curtis {{was struck by the}} whiteness of Irish people, so much so that she made inappropriate <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> these people.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't, papa," [...] said Katie, whose gravity quickly returned. [...] "It's {{all very}} well for you to <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and laugh at me, but I {{can tell you that}} this account won't balance; there is a two-and-sixpence wrong somewhere, and you know it has to be all copied out and sent off by the evening post to-morrow. I really can't {{understand}} why we are called upon to make so many copies of all the accounts and papers for that ridiculous Board of Trade; I'm sure they have plenty of idle clerks of their own, without requiring us to slave as we do--for such a wretched salary, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad he has gone, {{because he}} would do us no good," [...] said Rachel. [...] "You were angry with me just now because I spoke of {{interference}}. I meant it. I will not admit of any interference from you." [...] Then she sat with her two hands on her knees, looking him full in the face. [...] "I love you with all my heart, and am ready to tell everyone that I am to become your wife. They have a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the theatre calling me Mrs. Jones; and because nobody believes what anybody says they think you're a myth. I suppose it is queer that a singing girl should marry Mr. Jones. I'm {{to go in the}} autumn to Covent Garden, and get ever so much more money, and I shall still talk about Mr. Jones,--unless you and I agree to break it off." ...|$|E
60|$|I wish I {{could say}} that I was myself in the least {{affected}} by the news. I did not <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> like my friend Fips; this was more for propriety's sake than for feeling's: but for my old school acquaintance, the friend of my early days, the merry associate {{of the last few}} months, I own, with shame, that I had not a tear or a pang. In some German tale there is an account of a creature most beautiful and bewitching, whom all men admire and follow; but this charming and fantastic spirit only leads them, one by one, into ruin, and then leaves them. The novelist, who describes her beauty, says that his heroine is a fairy, and HAS NO HEART. I think the intimacy which is begotten over the wine-bottle, is a spirit of this nature; I never knew a good feeling come from it, or an honest friendship made by it; it only entices men and ruins them; it is only a phantom of friendship and feeling, called up by the delirious blood, and the wicked spells of the wine.|$|E
5000|$|The Count {{mentions}} 2:30 at {{any chance}} {{he can get}} and often makes <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This number is likely a tooth-related pun ("Tooth Hurty"). During the afternoon, his segments of the show always come on at exactly 2:30 p.m. or during the [...] "fashionably late" [...] segment, which airs at 2:31.|$|R
60|$|MISS HOWARD. Well, {{you ought}} to be thankful. You're very lucky, if you knew it. (Lowering her voice.) Shall I tell you a secret? I've seen your chart and you've no cause to worry. Doctor Stanton <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He said you were too uninteresting--there was so little the matter with you.|$|R
5000|$|The Mason City Globe-Gazette in Mason City {{noted on}} Hickenlooper's death that he despaired of obtaining {{political}} success {{because of his}} name. [...] "The abbreviation used by friends Hick was even worse. But Hickenlooper found the secret in kidding about his last name in public, making more <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> than had his political foes." ...|$|R
