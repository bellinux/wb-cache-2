5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> much {{of the history of}} medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} the key concepts that underpin mentorship. In healthcare, the term mentorship {{can be used}} to describe a relationship in which the mentor formally monitors and assesses the skill development of the person being mentored. It {{can also be used to}} describe a less formal relationship in which an older and more experienced colleague acts as a guide to someone less experienced. Whatever <b>the</b> relationship, there <b>are</b> some underpinning principles that are explored in this paper.

25|$|Chromatin {{changes are}} a {{plausible}} {{explanation for the}} co-regulation seen in clusters. Chromatin consists of the DNA strand and histones that {{are attached to the}} DNA.

Because of tight packing the DNA is almost unreachable for the transcript machinery, covering deleterious DNA with proteins <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the cell can protect itself. Chromatin which consists of functional genes is often an open structure were the DNA is accessible. However, most of the genes are not needed to be expressed all the time.|$|E
25|$|As used by fumigators {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} cyanide, copper(II) salt and an aromatic amine such as benzidine {{is added to}} the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound.|$|E
40|$|Etienne de Villiers as ethicist of responsibility. The paper {{considered}} six ways {{to describe}} Etienne de Villiers as ethicist of responsibility. They broadly corresponded with chronological phases in his academic career. <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he initially took responsibility to teach theological ethics in a methodologically reflective <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he increasingly found {{answers to these}} methodological concerns in responsibility ethics as an approach. <b>The</b> third <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he spent much time analysing the work of responsibility ethicists. This critical engagement led to a fourth phase, still ongoing, developing his own approach. Against this background, the paper argued that {{he had always been}} an ethicist of responsibility in the fifth sense that he addressed urgent moral challenges. Developing this, a final section claims that he was an ethicist of responsibility according to Weber’s description of science as vocation. <b>The</b> paper <b>was</b> read as key note presentation at the University of Pretoria on 09 November 2011, when D.

25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, {{rather than a}} class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, {{it is not possible}} to provide a definitive account of what it is to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular form of life in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
25|$|Disregarding intermediates, {{the basic}} {{distinction}} between asexual and sexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, {{in a process}} named meiosis. The resulting cells are called gametes, and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism. Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).|$|E

Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), media literacy and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings.

25|$|Properties {{meaningful}} for {{projective geometry}} are respected by this new idea of transformation, {{which is more}} radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers {{is what kind of}} geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle {{is an example of a}} concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.|$|E
25|$|All human {{societies}} organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations {{between parents and}} children (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form descent groups, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as clans. Another function <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> kinship unites families through marriage, forming kinship alliances between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited—such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either cross or parallel cousins. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of kinship terminology in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity (nurture kinship).|$|E

Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that {{the secret of the}} success of the Savoy operas <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> [...] "Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment." [...] Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on [...] "mirth and silliness". Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like Victory, Goliath, Audacious and Minotaur.|$|E

[...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E
