National Certificate courses are offered at several levels mapped to the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). Entry requirements may vary based on the course. Entry requirements for a National Certificate at Level 3 (NC 3) are generally a <b>Form</b> <b>III</b> Certificate or completion of Form IV in secondary school, the National Trade Certificate Foundation, or the equivalent. Entry requirements for a National Certificate at Level 4 (NC 4) or Level 5 (NC 5) are generally a School Certificate (SC), a GCE O Level, a National Certificate at Level 3 in related trades, or the equivalent. The course generally lasts for one to two years, depending on the level and field of study. Students may then progress onto a National Diploma, Diploma, or Higher National Diploma course.|$|E

2500|$|The {{average size}} of the four classes {{in the first year}} of the college was thirty boys. But Form IV {{commenced}} with fourteen pupils. These had come from ten different schools. There had been no unity in the textbooks used in these schools but also the boys had studied different subjects. By the end of the first term it was evident to the Brothers that there was quite a teaching problem and it was decided to start the second term of Form IV with Theorem One in Geometry and Lesson One in French, Latin, Algebra, etc. - all the start of <b>Form</b> <b>III</b> work. The object was to get through two complete years' work (<b>Form</b> <b>III</b> and Form IV - Years 9 and 10) in two terms (i.e. the second and third terms - from May to December). Many of the fourteen pupils transferred down to <b>Form</b> <b>III.</b> For the senior class, play or recreation time was cut in half. School was conducted on Saturday mornings, when the week's theoretical study of Chemistry was tested by practical experiments. [...] "No text books were allowed on Saturdays, and woe betide any student who didn't know the properties and tests for various gases and metals and their respective weights". Brother O'Driscoll, a large man, vigorously thumped or pounded the blackboard to drive home important points. Several new blackboards had to be acquired. By the third term only four students were left - Bill Aitkin, Max Denize, Des and John Rosser. The following year (1940) Brother O'Driscoll allowed three to sit for Matriculation (University Entrance) and one for the Public Service Examination. All four passed. The first Dux of the college was Des Rosser in 1940. His twin brother John was dux in 1941. The brothers subsequently donated the Rosser Cup, presented each year for Dux of St Peter's College.|$|E
2500|$|The verb {{classes in}} Arabic are formed along two axes. [...] One axis (described as [...] "form I", [...] "form II", etc.) {{is used to}} specify {{grammatical}} concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive, and involves varying the stem form. [...] For example, from the root K-T-B [...] "write" [...] is derived form I kátab/yíktib [...] "write", form II káttib/yikáttib [...] "cause to write", <b>form</b> <b>III</b> ká:tib/yiká:tib [...] "correspond", etc. [...] The other axis {{is determined by the}} particular consonants making up the root. [...] For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. ráma/yírmi [...] "throw" [...] from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. gá:b/yigí:b [...] "bring" [...] from G-Y-B).|$|E

Meanwhile, hollow verbs are usually caused by one of those two letters as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs have a full vowel (/a/, /i/ or /u/) before the final consonant, often along with only two consonants (žab/yžib [...] "bring" [...] from Ž-Y-B).|$|E
