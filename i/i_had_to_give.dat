5|$|Initially Ivan Alexander, who {{was still}} {{nominally}} the rightful ruler of Vidin, did not take active measures for its recovery, although his refusal to give safe conduct to the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos who was returning to Constantinople from Western Europe was explained by {{the deterioration of the}} Bulgarian–Hungarian relations. By 1369, however, he organised an Orthodox anti-Hungarian coalition for the liberation of Vidin with the participation of the Wallachian voivode Vladislav I Vlaicu and despot Dobrotitsa. The allied campaign was a success and after it was supported by a popular uprising in Vidin against the Catholic clergy and the Hungarian authority, Louis <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his claims and restore Ivan Sratsimir to the throne in Vidin in the autumn of 1369. According to historian J. Fine, Ivan Sratsimir was allowed to return to Vidin by Louis I as a Hungarian vassal because of his popularity among the population and because Ivan Sratsimir used the Hungarian patronage to assert independence from his father and later to resist his brother in Tarnovo.|$|E

Tim Nixon of The Sun wrote that the [...] "red hot chemistry" [...] between Rihanna and Timberlake must have been difficult for their partners to watch. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said that Timberlake's partner Jessica Biel was [...] "said to be 'sick to her stomach' after seeing Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while filming with Timberlake." [...] Timberlake told Access Hollywood, [...] "I’m {{the guy in the}} video, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them all insecurities about that. But yeah we had a great time, we goofed around at the shoot most of the time." [...] The video premiered November 17,2008, on MTV.|$|E

2500|$|I sent {{it out to}} Doubleday {{and they}} refused it. They said, [...] "We asked for a novel." [...] They didn't {{consider}} it a novel.

My agent told me later they called the editor on the carpet for having refused the book— only after they {{saw that it was}} selling fast. It only had to do with sales.

2500|$|... "I {{was never}} World {{champion}} {{so it is}} my biggest victory so far! I {{was focused on the}} individual pursuit, everything for me was on that. My individual pursuit was good, but I was fifth and just missed the finals. I was very disappointed because I also missed the Olympic Games, because I only started riding [...] on the track four months ago. I didn't have enough points to ride in the individual pursuit in the Olympics." [...] About the scratch race she continued: [...] "My plan was to attack about 10 laps from the finish, I wanted to go when the speed was a bit lower. I did it about eight laps before the finish. I was surprised, but every country has just one rider so they don't work together. That was better for me to ride away. I didn't look behind, just once," [...] she added. [...] "I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it everything and if there was no gap, then there was no gap. But it worked out well." [...] Despite having quite a considerable gap coming into the final lap, Van Dijk refused to believe that the race was won until the very end. She detailed the point at which she realised that she was definitely going to triumph. [...] "Just 100 metres before the finish," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't know how big the gap was , I didn't look back, I was just focused on riding hard and getting everything out." [...] A few days on from the frustration of non-qualification, her new rainbow jersey and gold medal provide her {{with a great deal of}} compensation. [...] "I was really, really disappointed with that," [...] she confirmed. [...] "But this makes up for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I realized that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E
