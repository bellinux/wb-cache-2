There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
500|$|While Confessions {{was still}} in production, Usher promised [...] "real talk" [...] in it. He decided [...] "to let it all hang out by singing about {{some of his own}} little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets." [...] He explained: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I just want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal". Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E

[...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

There's this fighter <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> kind of needs to be put to rest a little bit. I don't need to be so tough to protect myself." [...] While speaking to Vanity Fair at the premiere of her film Obsessed, Larter spoke about her own obsessions, [...] "I love to cook. I spend weekends reading cookbooks—it's really my relaxation." [...] She has ranked Scarface, The Bourne Identity, Best in Show, Blue Sky and Grey Gardens as her favorite films.|$|E
500|$|In Aesthetic Realism {{classes and}} lessons, Koppelman learned that ethical {{problems}} are also artistic problems. [...] He felt his work {{suffered from a}} fight between rigidity and flexibility. He learned he could go after precision in the studio as penance for being careless at other times, wanting {{to get away from}} things. [...] As freedom and order, truth and imagination became more integrated in his life, his art became more imaginative. “I had always had a classical bent in my work,” he wrote. “But there was also a wildness <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> had not come into my work sufficiently or gracefully.” As a result of his study, Koppelman noted, “Tightness and abandon, the classical and the wild, even the conservative and the rebel seemed to be working better together” resulting in art that was “more imaginative, freer in concept” [...] Boldness of imagination and an unerring sense of detail were two qualities Koppelman’s work became noted for.|$|E

When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would like her to be funny and {{have a little bit of}} an agenda that might look a little bit vengeful, but it really isn’t.

[...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing.

500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of dealing with people who put you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try to make her feel down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's a light <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> shines brightly. They can try but they can't take that away from me." ...|$|E

But he had that faith <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'd get my act together". During that year Wilson also guested on Hunters & Collectors album, What's a Few Men?

He was always under the impression I was going to do well at the Olympic trials and time-wise it was one of my best events ever." [...] After being selected to compete at the 2000 Paralympic Games, Wu won five medals in Sydney, including golds in the 100m backstroke and the 100m butterfly, silvers in the 400m freestyle and the 200m individual medley, and a bronze in the 100m freestyle.|$|E

Jepsen viewed her predicament as an opportunity to step back from the overexposure and reflect on what direction to take with her next album. She met with her record label and management after The Summer Kiss Tour wrapped up in late 2013, stating: [...] "'I want you to put your faith <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'll come back when it's ready,' and they did and I'm very lucky to have a team that wasn't about trying to mass produce things and was really more looking at the quality of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1920 to 1922, Sorge {{lived in}} Solingen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach, ex-wife of Dr Kurt Albert Gerlach, a wealthy {{communist}} {{and professor of}} political science in Kiel, who had taught Sorge. Christine Gerlach later remembered about meeting Sorge for the first time: “It was as if a stroke of lightning ran through me. In this one second something awoke <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> had slumbered until now, something dangerous, dark, inescapable….” Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921. In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche ("First Marxist Work Week" [...] conference) in Ilmenau. Sorge continued his work as a journalist, and also helped organize the library of the Institute for Social Research, a new Marxist think-tank in Frankfurt.|$|E

2500|$|But Maugham's {{homosexuality}} or bisexuality {{is believed}} to have shaped his fiction in two ways. Since he tended to see attractive women as sexual rivals, he often gave his women characters sexual needs and appetites, in a way quite unusual for authors of his time. Liza of Lambeth, Cakes and Ale, The Painted Veil, Neil MacAdam and The Razor's Edge all featured women determined to feed their strong sexual appetites, heedless of the result. As Maugham's sexual appetites were then officially disapproved of, or criminal, in nearly all of the countries in which he travelled, the author was unusually tolerant of the vices of others. Some readers and critics complained that Maugham did not condemn what was bad in the villains of his fiction and plays. Maugham replied: [...] "It must be a fault <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am not gravely shocked at the sins of others unless they personally affect me." ...|$|E

Clarke, who has been purposefully avoiding the Vice King, asked for permission from Chulalongkorn before any contact would be made. After he received Chulalongkorn's permission, the Governor' asked Vichaichan {{to send a letter}} laying out his case, Vichaichan wrote that: [...] "Some foolish men, wishing to change the customs and usages of the country, has turned the king against him." [...] The King, Governor Clarke and Admiral Ryder met again at the home of the American missionary Reverend J.H. Chandler, whose service as a translator was needed in the final document. The document itself ended with words from Chulalongkorn to Vichaichan: [...] "I beg you, who sign these Articles of Reconciliation, to have Full faith <b>in</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I will assuredly devise no mischief whatever to Krom Phra Rachawang , which would be unjust, and I will keep to these Articles in every respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, World War I began. At first, Klee was {{somewhat}} detached from it, {{as he wrote}} ironically, [...] "I have long had this war <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern." [...] Klee was conscripted as a Landsturmsoldat (soldier of the reserve forces in Prussia or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends August Macke and Franz Marc in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink lithographs on war themes including Death for the Idea (1915). After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company in Oberschleissheim, executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft camouflage, and [...] accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he {{was transferred to the}} Royal Bavarian flying school in Gersthofen (which 54 years later became the USASA Field Station Augsburg) to work as a clerk for the treasurer {{until the end of the}} war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.|$|E
