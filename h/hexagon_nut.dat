40|$|To {{improve the}} {{rigidity}} of the exposed type steel column base, the anchor bolt shall be tightened. The nut tightening {{tests of the}} anchor bolt set with the rolled threads, the torque-control type <b>hexagon</b> <b>nut,</b> the discspring and the plain washer were conducted. The fracture behavior and the bolt tension are discussed. And {{the relationship between the}} diameter of the narrow part in nut and the failure tightening torque is investigated...|$|E
