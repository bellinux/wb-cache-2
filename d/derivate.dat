Maize seed naturally infected with Fusarirum spp. fungi (F. graminearum, F. monilifrome) and saprophytic fungi (Pencilium spp., Aspergillus spp., Trichothecium roseum, Rhizopus nigricans, Alternaria spp., Cladosporium herbarium and Acremoniela atra) was treated immediately after harvesting with hydroxyquinoline halogenated <b>derivates</b> (J, Cl, Br) and TMTD (Radotiram) in a 200 g/mtc dose. The seed was stored for five months.

Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Rigvedic.|$|E
25|$|One {{physiological}} {{stimulus to}} epinephrine secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated using the denervated pupil {{of a cat}} as an assay, later confirmed using a biological assay on urine samples. Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards. Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of epinephrine in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme-isotope <b>derivate</b> radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for epinephrine. Early REA plasma assays indicated that epinephrine and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when anaerobic metabolism commences.|$|E

25|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{molecule}} BC (cyanobromide 37) and the western part AD (thiodextrolin 55, with the propionic acid ester group racemized) were then joined using potassium t-butoxide to thioether 56 (through a sulfide ion intermediate). A second sulfur contraction (cyanoethyl phosphine/ trifluoroacetic acid/sulfolane) yielded cyanocorrigenolide 57 with the propionic acid ester group of ring C also racemised. Due to the steric bulk of both reactants this contraction was the only successful method. The oxygen atoms in the lactam and the lactone group were replaced by sulfur (phosphorus pentasulfide/4-methylpyridine) in dithiocyanocorrigenolide 58 and the S-methyl <b>derivate</b> 59 was formed by reaction with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate. Dimethylamine addition opened the thiolactone ring with an exocyclic alkene group in 60 by elimination of the sulfide anion from the methyl group.

2500|$|R100943 {{inhibited}} HIV-1 and {{was considerably}} effective against {{a number of}} key NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to loviride (α-APA) and nevirapine. [...] G190A mutation was thought to cause resistance by occupying a part of the binding pocket that would otherwise be filled by the linker part of the butterfly shaped NNRTIs. R100943, in the horseshoe mode of binding, is located at a distance of approximately 6.0 Å from G190. When compared with nevirapine and loviride which bind in the butterfly shape the ITU derivatives revealed improved activity against Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L mutants. A structural study suggested that a potent TIBO compound could partly supplement for the effects of the Tyr-181C mutation by moving itself in the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) of the mutant RT. In this context, R100943 has [...] torsional freedom that enables the conformational alternations of the NNRTI. This torsional freedom could be used by the ITU <b>derivate</b> to bind to a mutated NNIBP and thus compensating for the effects of a resistance mutation. Nevertheless, the potency of R100943 against HIV-1 resistant mutants was not adequate for it to be considered as an effective drug candidate.

40|$|In this diploma thesis {{were studied}} {{solubilization}} properties of polysaccharides by using hydrophobic solutes (Sudan Orange G, Sudan Red G, (±) -alpha-Tocopherol, Pyrene, Perylene, Nile red), which were represented by alkyl <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan. At first, a behaviour of individual hydrophobic solutes {{was investigated in}} variously polar solvents (Methanol, 1 Propanol, Chloroforme, Cyklohexane, n Heptane) and in the environment of varying ionic strength (water, 0. 1 M and 0. 4 M NaCl). Afterwards, solubilization properties of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate model solubilizated the hydrophobic solutes into a core of micelles was examinate. We {{were interested in the}} solubilization capacity as the mol of solubilized molecules per mol micelles of surfactant corresponding with a state of micelles saturation. In the case of the solubilization of (±) -alpha-Tocopherol into the core of micelles, {{it was not possible to}} determine the solubilization capacity. So we changed the determination of universally solubilization power. The solubilization power is defined as mol of molecules solubilized per mol surfactant relative to the quantity solubilizate at the micelles saturation. Model system of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate as a simple surfactant carrying a negative charge as the alkyl <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan was selected bacause of its characteristics. The surfactant forms unimolar micelles and its critical micelle concentrations and aggregation numbers are tabelated for the investigated microenvironment. The main aim of the study was investigating of hydrophobic domains of alkyl <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan as free places for incorporation hydropbobic solutes in the microenvironment of varying ionic strength. The critical aggregation concentrations were determined by the Pyrene 1 : 3 ratio method. For the research of micropolarity of alkyl <b>derivates</b> hyaluronan’s domains were selected two concentrations of <b>derivates</b> for the next research of solubilization experiments - the first concentration near the critical aggregation concentration and the second concentration above it. The effect of concentration of Pyrene on a core polarity of <b>derivates</b> was investigated. We discovered the influence of the concentration and the other we found a stationary area of the concentration. In the end we investigated the influence of preparation of solutions of <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan on the core polarity by the concentration of pyrene which corresponds to the stationary area. The study of solubilization properties of alkyl <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan is not a simple case as we assumed. When we measured spectra of the absorbance, higher concentration of <b>derivates</b> of hyaluronan belittle absorbance of solubilizates. At the experiment of solubilization with Sudan Red G we found out that Sudan Red G is not able to solubilizate into the hydrophobic core of micelles of hyaluronan’s <b>derivates</b> because of lipophilic or steric effects. We had to change Perylene as a new solubilizate. From the measured emission spectra we found saturation micelles. We can express the solubilization power of hyaluronan’s <b>derivates</b> for the concentration of Perylene. The main aim of the diploma thesis was to determine optimal way of the preparation of hyaluronan’s <b>derivates</b> solutions with required degree of solubilization...|$|R
