5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} {{had a much}} <b>harder</b> <b>time,</b> {{because the}} country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E

Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E

25|$|The union soldiered on {{for another}} {{seventeen}} years, finding itself increasingly outmatched in its battles with employers. While it defeated all of the Steelworkers' efforts to replace it in its western strongholds in the 1950s, it had a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> holding on to its outposts in the South. In addition, more conservative members, uneasy with the union's foreign policy and with {{the increasing number of}} African-American and Mexican-American unionists, tried to take their locals out of the union, opening up fissures that weakened the union's strikes against the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1954 and 1959. The union eventually merged with the Steelworkers in 1967 after losing locals to it in Butte and Canada. Only Local 598 in Sudbury, Ontario, which had a contentious and sometimes violent history with the city's Steelworkers locals, voted against the merger – it remained autonomous until 1993, when it merged with the Canadian Auto Workers.|$|E

40|$|The joint {{solution}} of routing problems with soft and <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> windows has valuable practical applications. Simultaneous solution approaches to {{both types of}} problems are needed when: (a) the number of routes needed for <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> windows exceeds the number of available vehicles, (b) a study of cost-service tradeoffs is required or the dispatcher has qualitative information regarding {{the relative importance of}} <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> window constraints across customers. A new Iterative Route Construction and Improvement (IRCI) algorithm of average run time performance 2 () O n is proposed to sequentially solve Vehicle Routing Problems with Soft Time Windows (VRPSTW) and <b>Hard</b> <b>Time</b> Windows (VRPHTW). Due to its modular and hierarchical design, the IRCI algorithm is intuitive, easy to code, and able to accommodate general cost and penalty functions. The solution quality and computational time of the new algorithm is compared against existing results on benchmark problems for the VRPHTW and VRPSTW. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used to obtain faster simultaneous solutions for both VRPHTW and VRPHTW problems using the soft time windows solutions as a lower bound for <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> window problems. Despite its simplicity and flexibility, the algorithm performs well in terms of solution quality and speed in instances with soft and <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> windows...|$|R
25|$|Schwartz's firm {{worked on}} the {{proposal}} {{for over a year}} and considered five options aside from streetcars. One other option, Select Bus Service, was estimated to cost $1 billion to implement, and wasn't chosen as it wouldn't raise property values the way that a streetcar would. The engineers projected 52,000 to 53,000 riders per day on the streetcar, which would have required a bus every minute. Each street car would be able to carry 150 to 175 passengers. Additionally, buses would also have a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> navigating the 12 to 15 streets along the route. The engineers' route would have its own dedicated lanes for the whole route. The study recommended that two facilities for maintenance and storage would be built at a cost of $100 million. In addition, the streetcar would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars {{and a host of other}} workers, including traffic enforcement agents.|$|E

25|$|This led to {{the arrest}} of Checheb and Cuzcat in December 1868. This caused resentment among the Tzotzils.

The indigenous force was quickly dispersed and routed with government troops pursuing pockets of guerrilla resistance in the mountains until 1870.

25|$|No {{correlation}} (positive or negative) {{exists between}} intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy {{children have a}} <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and {{because they do not}} engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{transportation}} of heavy wooden barrels of wine over land was a costly and risky proposition. Wine regions close to easily navigable rivers, {{such as the}} Loire and Garonne, found the possibility of trade to other regions and outside France more attainable and profitable while more isolated and landlocked regions like Burgundy had a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> developing much of a trade market outside their region. Port cities like Bordeaux, La Rochelle and Rouen emerged as formidable centers of commerce with the wines of Gascony, Haut Pays, Poitou and the Île-de-France. During this period, political climates and alliances played a substantial role in the trade of French wines to other European countries. The 1152 marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with Henry Plantagenet, the future Henry II of England, {{was the beginning of}} a long and fruitful relationship between Bordeaux and England. The 1295 Auld Alliance between France and Scotland against England gave the Scots ample access to French wines for themselves. At the height of its power, the Duchy of Burgundy included the southern parts of the Netherlands and Flanders—introducing the Dutch to the wines of Burgundy.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1982 the UWA made Dos Caras the next UWA World Heavyweight Champion, using the {{opportunity}} to revive the feud between Dos Caras and El Canek. In between fighting Dos Caras El Canek had many opportunities to defend Mexico, including a match on September 2, 1984 where the then WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan actually defended the championship against El Canek in Mexico. The match ended in a draw with both wrestlers winning one fall before the time limit expired. Canek would also have a successful title defense against Stan Hansen {{only a few weeks}} later. Dos Caras would win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship twice more from El Canek during their feud, but the storyline never results in a Luchas de Apuestas match between El Canek and Dos Caras. While the UWA kept using the appeal of El Canek fighting against foreigners it was not until November 22, 1989 that they had another foreigner win the championship as Big Van Vader pinned El Canek. As time went on the UWA struggled to draw the crowds they were used to during their heyday of the 1980s the UWA had a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> drawing a paying audience for El Canek fighting foreigners such as Buffalo Allen, P.N. News, Konnan, King Haku, or Kokina. On January 31, 1993 El Canek lost the championship to Canadian Vampire Casanova, a decision that was later held up as one of the critical points in the later demise of the UWA as the fans did not like Vampiro and the attendance dropped significally while he was champion and never recovered even after El Canek regained the championship. In 1995 the UWA closed, with El Canek being the reigning and 13 time champion at that point in time. Even though the UWA had closed El Canek kept wearing the heavyweight championship belt and actually defended it on various shows around Mexico despite the UWA no longer being around.|$|E
