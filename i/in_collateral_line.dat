50|$|In 2014 the Portuguese {{parliament}} {{changed the}} Portuguese nationality law {{in order to}} grant Portuguese nationality to descendants of Sephardi Jews expelled from Portugal. The law is a reaction to historical {{events that led to}} their expulsion from Portugal, but also due to increased concerns over Jewish communities throughout Europe. In order to obtain Portuguese nationality, the person must have a family surname that attests being a direct descendant of a Sephardi of Portuguese origin, or with family connections <b>in</b> a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> from a former Portuguese Sephardi community. Use of expressions in Portuguese in Jewish rites or Judaeo-Portuguese or Ladino can also be considered proof.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick Ruthven was a {{descendant}} of Sir William Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven <b>in</b> a <b>collateral</b> <b>line.</b> A lifelong professional soldier, Ruthven earned his reputation {{in the service of}} the King of Sweden, which he entered about 1609 and left 1637. He had been forced into exile to retain his family name which had been outlawed in Scotland by act of Parliament in 1600. As a negotiator he was very useful to Gustavus Adolphus because of his ability to [...] "drink immeasurably and preserve his understanding to the last", and he also won fame on the field of battle. By 1621 Ruthven served as colonel for the Småland infantry regiment with which he campaigned in Livonia (Latvia). He took as his second in command Alexander Leslie, later promoted field marshal and one of Ruthven's opponents in the English Civil War. Ruthven was one of four Scottish colonels to be knighted by Gustav II Adolf of Sweden in 1627, the others being Alexander Leslie, David Drummond and John Hepburn.|$|R
40|$|This paper adresses {{the various}} {{instances}} of the Princely Body in the Burgundian dominions {{and the subsequent}} Habsburg Netherlands up to the Revolt against Philip II, king of Spain. Still {{in the shadow of}} the French King’s two bodies during the principate of the first two dukes, the Burgundian princely body gains in differentiation (natural body vs institutional body) and sacralisation with Philip the Good and above all with Charles the Bold and his claims to more autonomy and sovereignity. Rituals and other forms of communication point at the duke’s body as the essential link between the heterogeneous components of his state and emphazise the dynastic continuity of power. Their Habsburg successors, including emperor Charles V, are in their turn part of this tradition in the Low Countries. Untimely deaths, funerals, political assassinations, gender issues, minorities, regencies and abdication, all point to the centrality of the Prince’s natural body in the affairs of state.

2500|$|His son, Elector Frederick Augustus II (1733–63), was {{received}} into the Catholic Church on 28 November 1712, at Bologna, Italy, while heir-apparent. With this conversion, which {{on account of}} the excited state of feeling of the Lutheran population had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling family of Saxony once more became Catholic. Before this, individual members of the Albertine line had returned to the Romanist church, but they had died without issue, as did the last rulers of Saxe-Merseburg (in 1738) and Saxe-Weissenfels (died out <b>in</b> 1746). Another <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> founded <b>in</b> 1657 was that of Saxe-Zeitz, which became extinct in 1759. Those who became Catholics of this line were Christian Augustus (died 1725), cardinal and Archbishop of Gran (Esztergom, Hungary) and Maurice Adolphus, Bishop of Leitmeritz in Bohemia (died 1759).|$|R
40|$|Can central {{counterparty}} (CCP) clearing control counterparty {{risk in the}} presence of risk taking that can aggravate such risk? When counterparty risk is not observable, I show that central clearing leads to higher collateral requirements for two different reasons. Without collusion about risk taking, a CCP offering diversification of risk cannot selectively forgo incentives for transactions that use collateral only for insurance. With collusion about risk taking, a CCP needs to charge <b>collateral</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the worst counterparty quality to control risk taking. Requiring more collateral reduces market liquidity and worsens incentives causing a feedback effect that amplifies collateral costs...|$|R
60|$|No complex {{instinct}} {{can possibly}} be produced through natural selection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet profitable, variations. Hence, {{as in the case}} of corporeal structures, we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find <b>in</b> the <b>collateral</b> <b>lines</b> of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find, making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being known among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under different circumstances, etc.; in which case either the one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.|$|R

The republican patriot Luigi Giannuzzi Savelli dei principi di Cerenzia was shot 3 April 1799 by orders of Cardinal Ruffo, and the feudal lands of Prince Tommaso Giannuzzi Savelli of Cerenzia were confiscated: Cerenzia, Casino (Castelsilano) Montespinello (Spinello) Belvedere Malapezza, and Zinga.|$|R
5000|$|The {{family history}} started with Count Adolf I, scion of a cadet {{branch of the}} Rhenish Berg dynasty {{residing}} at Altena Castle in Westphalia. In the early 13th century Adolf took his residence at his family's estates around Mark, a settlement in present-day Hamm-Uentrop.
