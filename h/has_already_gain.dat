This work evaluated and compared the antioxidant status of methanol leaves extracts of Azadirachta Indica (MAI), Vernonia Amygdalina (MVA) and Carica Papaya (MCP). Methods: Phenols, Flavonoids,percentage inhibition of lipid peroxidation and radical scavenging activities using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 - picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and Hydroxyl radicals were determined spectrophotometrically based on international standardized methods. Results: Total Phenolic content in garlic acid equivalence (GAE) were expressed maximally at 700 μg/ml by 0. 015 ± 0. 002, 0. 019 ± 0. 017, 0. 013 ± 0. 006 mg/g and flavonoids contents at 350 μg/ml by 0. 063 ± 0. 004, 0. 020 ± 0. 031, 0. 049 ± 0. 002 Mg/g quercetin equivalence (QE) for MAI, MVA and MCP respectively.
