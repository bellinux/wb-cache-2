5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using <b>deadly</b> <b>force,</b> and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} Chinese population, spurred by {{government}} repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} <b>deadly</b> <b>force.</b> On 7October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.|$|E

They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including <b>deadly</b> <b>force</b> if deemed necessary. On 8 January 2006, a major civil exercise involving over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies, codenamed Exercise Northstar V, simulating bombing and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted.

Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list <b>deadly</b> <b>force</b> as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about widespread and ongoing excessive use of force.

50|$|Judge Sol Wachtler {{wrote for}} a {{unanimous}} court. The Court held that {{to use an}} entirely subjective test {{to determine whether a}} defendant appropriately used <b>deadly</b> physical <b>force</b> would be very dangerous, in that it would permit a jury to acquit every defendant who believed that his actions were reasonable, regardless of how bizarre the rationale. The Court explained that the justification statute requires an objective element, in that <b>deadly</b> physical <b>force</b> is only permissible if a reasonable person would believe that he is in imminent fear of serious physical injury or death. This would prevent the slippery slope of a different reasonable test necessary for every single defendant claiming justification.|$|R
