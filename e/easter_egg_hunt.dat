500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were improvised by the actors. The scenes with Tom hinting at bribes and corrupt deals with {{developers}} was largely improvised by actor Aziz Ansari. The producers were concerned the subplot would make Tom too unlikeable, but instead audiences responded positively because they felt it was an accurate portrayal of some aspects of small town government. Aziz also improvised the lines in which he brown-nosed to the developers as they entered the public forum. In one talking head-style documentary interview, Leslie insists a park like the one she envisioned for Pawnee could not be built in communist Russia, and she goes on to impersonate Russian children playing in a park. The scene was completely improvised by Poehler during multiple takes, and Michael Schur called it [...] "my favorite talking head that Amy has done". The cold open of the episode features Leslie wearing bunny ears and helping children on an <b>Easter</b> <b>egg</b> <b>hunt</b> at a park. Since Tom forgot to hide any eggs, Leslie and the children assume it is an extremely difficult egg hunt. The cold open was the last scene shot for [...] "Canvassing", and was conceived at the last moment because the production date was near Easter, and series co-creator Michael Schur said he [...] "thought it would be funny to put Amy (Poehler) in bunny ears". Since it was shot after the majority of the episode, Seth Gordon was not available to direct it.|$|E
