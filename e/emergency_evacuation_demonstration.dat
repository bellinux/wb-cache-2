50|$|In {{case of an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> situation, it is {{important}} to have an individual <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> kit prepared and on hand prior to the <b>emergency.</b> An <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> kit is a container of food, clothing, water, and other supplies that can be used to sustain an individual during lag time. Lag time is the period between the actual occurrence of an emergency and when organized help becomes available, generally 72 hours, though this can vary from a few hours to several days. It may take this long for authorities to get evacuation shelters fully up and functional. During this time, evacuees may suffer fairly primitive conditions; no clean water, heat, lights, toilet facilities, or shelter. An <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> kit, or 72-hour kit, can help evacuees to endure the evacuation experience with dignity and a degree of comfort.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{the number}} of {{disasters}} has been seriously increasing. The total damages by the natural or man-made disasters during the past years resulted in tremendous fatalities and recovery costs. It is necessary to have efficient <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> management which is concerned with identifying evacuation route, and the estimation of evacuation and clearance times. An <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> model is important in identifying critical locations, and developing various evacuation strategies. In that existing evacuation models have focused on route analysis for indoor evacuation, {{there are only a}} few models for areawide <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> analysis. Therefore, we developed a mesoscopic model by using Cube Avenue and performed evacuation simulation, targeting road network in City of Fargo, North Dakota. Consequently, a mesoscopic model developed in this study is used to carry out dynamic analysis using network and input variable of existing travel demand model. The results of this study show that the model is an appropriate tool for areawide <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> analysis to save time and cost. Henceforth, the results of this study can be applied to develop a disaster evacuation model which can be used for a variet...|$|R
