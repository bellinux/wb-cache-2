5|$|In an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iliad, Achilles drags {{the corpse}} behind his horse. Thus, the {{comparison}} with the Homeric Hector is heightened and, at the same time, aspects of the classical Troilus's fate are echoed.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first plate, {{there is}} but one person who shows concern {{for the welfare of}} the tormented horse. To the left of Nero, and almost unseen, a man notes down Nero's hackney coach number to report him.|$|E

5|$|The various {{historically}} driven {{changes have}} had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city. Most other Polish cities have suffered similarly, but the processes in Białystok, {{have had a}} particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist, while many others have been rebuilt to their original configuration. Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old historical shape of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|The band {{insisted on}} playing live, and brought their regular touring gear with them. Their roadie, Peter Watts, {{suggested}} that their 16-track recorder {{would produce a}} sound comparable to a studio recording. In addition, it transpired that the natural <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amphitheatre provided good acoustics for the recording.The equipment was carried by truck from London, and took three days to reach Pompeii. When it arrived, it was discovered there was insufficient power to drive the equipment correctly. This issue plagued filming for several days, and was finally resolved by running a lengthy cable from the local town hall.|$|E

25|$|The 1547 {{depiction}} of King Edward VI of England standing on an Oriental carpet, {{in front of}} a throne on the same carpet asserts the young Fidei defensor's strength and power, by a deliberate <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pose of his father's famous portrait by Holbein.|$|E
25|$|Lussinatta, the Lussi Night, {{was marked}} in Sweden 13 December. Then Lussi, a female being with evil traits, like a female demon or witch, {{was said to}} ride through the air with her followers, called Lussiferda.

25|$|Rutland {{shares a}} board with {{neighbouring}} Leicestershire, an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket Club.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement {{in this direction}} was the New Math of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic {{in the spirit of}} axiomatic development from set theory, an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing trend in higher mathematics.|$|E
25|$|J. R. R. Tolkien anglicized Álfheim as Elvenhome, or Eldamar in {{the speech}} of the Elves. In his stories, Eldamar lies in a coastal region of the Undying Lands in the Uttermost West.

25|$|During the Spanish colonial period, Spaniards {{developed}} a complex caste {{system based on}} race, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's importance in society. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually {{at the time of}} their independence, prejudice based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial caste system.|$|E

25|$|After a brief let-up, Sunline {{came back}} in {{distance}} and easily defeated other mares in the Auckland Breeders' Stakes (1,400 metres), in New Zealand, {{in preparation for the}} International Cup (2,000 metres) in Hong Kong. Sunline led, and her jockey, Greg Childs, explained that she travelled well to the home turn, but, in an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autumn's Queen Elizabeth Stakes, tired badly in the home straight and finished seventh. She then returned home to New Zealand for a spell.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the finest}} Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of Gelati, Kiev, Torcello, Venice, Monreale, Cefalù and Palermo. For instance, Venice's Basilica of St Mark, begun in 1063, {{was based on the}} great Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the {{basilica}} is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., Pala d'Oro).|$|E
25|$|In 1912, McCall {{refused to}} stand for reelection, and was instead {{considered}} by the state legislature for election to the United States Senate in early 1913, to succeed the outgoing Senator Winthrop Murray Crane. His opponent, John W. Weeks, was more conservative Republican who {{had the support of}} most of the Crane-dominated state party apparatus. The contest was bitterly divisive, an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Progressive Party split that damaged the party at the national level, and was narrowly won by Weeks, even though McCall led in the party caucus balloting for the first three ballots.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Bitar was pardoned by President Hafiz al-Assad, {{who came}} to power in 1970. Bitar {{returned}} briefly to Damascus; he was not reconciled with Assad and shortly, after a meeting with Assad ended without an agreement, Bitar launched a press campaign against the Syrian government from his exile in Paris, attacking it in a new magazine which he entitled al-Ihiyyaa al-Arabi, in an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name he and Aflaq had adopted almost forty years before. He was also rumored to be in contact with Syrian opposition figures in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Surely Bentley {{was right}} to be {{surprised}} at finding Faunus haunting the bower , a ghost crying in the cold of Paradise, and the lusts of Pan sacred even in comparison to Eden. There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the story. I suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> X11R6.4 {{licensing}} dispute, XFree86 released version 4.4 in February 2004 under a {{more restrictive}} license which many projects relying on X found unacceptable. The added clause to the license {{was based on}} the original BSD license's advertising clause, which was viewed by the Free Software Foundation and Debian as incompatible with the GNU General Public License. Other groups saw it as against the spirit of the original X. Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD, for instance, threatened to fork XFree86 citing license concerns. The license issue, combined with the difficulties in getting changes in, left many feeling the time was ripe for a fork.|$|E
