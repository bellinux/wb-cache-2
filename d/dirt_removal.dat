50|$|Temperature of the {{cleaning}} solution. Elevating {{the temperature of}} a cleaning solution increases its <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency. Molecules with high kinetic energy dislodge dirt faster than slow moving molecules of a cold solution.|$|E
50|$|Limitation {{to speed}} are: color correction, {{resizing}} aspect ratio, <b>dirt</b> <b>removal,</b> special effects, motion picture credits, and other restoration. Also bandwidth {{speed of the}} hardware limits real time playout: CPU, interface, SAN, memory, software and hardware.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{motion picture}} film {{scanners}} many have {{an option for}} an infrared CCD channel for dirt mapping, {{that can be used}} to automatically or in post manually remove dirt-dust spots on the film. The IR camera channel can be used with IR <b>dirt</b> and scratch <b>removal</b> system or made output on a four IR channel for downstream dirt and <b>dirt</b> and scratch <b>removal</b> systems. Popular downstream dirt and <b>dirt</b> and scratch <b>removal</b> systems are PF Clean and Digital ICE.|$|R
50|$|Soaps {{are formed}} from the {{reaction}} of glycerides with sodium hydroxide. The product of the reaction is glycerol and salts of fatty acids. Fatty acids in the soap emulsify the oils in <b>dirt,</b> enabling the <b>removal</b> of oily <b>dirt</b> with water.|$|R

50|$|Several support {{mechanisms}} can {{be found}} behind the shield, inside the finished part of the tunnel, which {{are part of the}} TBM: <b>dirt</b> <b>removal,</b> slurry pipelines if applicable, control rooms, rails for transport of the precast segments, etc.|$|E
50|$|Cationic head {{groups have}} a {{positive}} charge and cationic surfactants are used in several different applications. One common use for cationic surfactants is in fabric softeners. Cationic head groups are also added to laundry detergent in conjunction with anionic surfactants because they help to improve the <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> properties of the anionic surfactants. Cationic head groups also increase the disinfecting properties of household cleaners. Some common cationic surfactants head groups include amines and quaternary ammonium ions. Among the many types of surfactants, cationic surfactants are very useful corrosion inhibitors due of their protective effectiveness in neutral and acidic media.|$|E
5000|$|Basic {{preservation}} of lighthouse masonry usually includes gentle surface cleaning. Appropriate methods for cleaning {{are determined by}} the type of masonry that exists on the building. Some cleaning methods include water, chemical, and laser. [...] There are multiple water cleaning methods. Soaking is a process where the masonry undergoes a prolonged exposure to misting water to remove dirt. Water washing uses a light to medium pressurized stream of water. Some water washing may use the addition of detergents to increase <b>dirt</b> <b>removal.</b> Chemical cleaning is also an option, but may be too harsh depending on the makeup of the masonry. Chemical cleaners are either acidic or alkaline. Laser cleaning is effective, mostly on smaller areas of masonry, but can be costly. Occasionally, a lighthouse may be weatherproofed through covering the masonry with paint, stucco, or whitewash/lime mortar wash; but only if these are historically accurate for the structure. Due to the differences in materials and construction techniques, only an experienced architectural conservator should be contacted for conservation or restoration work.|$|E
50|$|DFT - Digital Film Technology {{revealed}} its newest {{film scanner}} at the 2009 NAB Show, Scanity.http://www.dft-film.com/scanners/scanity.php Scanity uses Time Delay Integration (TDI) line sensors and FPGA image processing. The TDI CCDs have over 4300 horizontal active pixels, and 96 TDI lines, with a 6μ pixel size. Scanity uses a continuous film transport servo system, using a capstan and a LED light source. Transfer speeds are up to: 15 frame/s @ 4K, 25 frame/s @ 2K, 44 frame/s @ 1K, 69 frame/s @ 0.5K, 96 frame/s @ 0.25K. Scanity LED light sources is variable and programmable. Like all the telecines above {{it uses a}} continuous motion capstan film transport. New for scanity {{is the use of}} an infrared CCD channel for dirt mapping. Also new is large drum gate that give better performance with older film and the use of CCD camera to take pictures of the pref hole. The pref hole camera image is used for real time picture stabilization, thus no pins are used in the pref sprocket holes. The Scanity can be set to use just on edge of the pref sprocket hole. Scanity has a new optical audio scanning option for 16mm and 35mm, also 16 mag strip audio. Dot Hill Systems as partnered with Digital Film Technology to capture 4k DPX files at 15 frames per second. Scanity has an optional Infrared-IR camera option.

Popular downstream dirt and <b>dirt</b> and scratch <b>removal</b> systems are PF Clean and Digital ICE.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD {{for the first time}} on November 17, 1998, which was reprinted numerous times in the ensuing years, both as a stand-alone release or bundled with other animated movies from MGM or 20th Century Fox. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman later oversaw a high-definition restoration of the film, which {{was released on}} June 19, 2007 in a 2-disc DVD set called the [...] "Family Fun Edition". Improvements in the transfer over the 1998 DVD include color correction and <b>dirt</b> and dust <b>removal,</b> and included special features such as audio commentary from both individuals, and an interview featurette. A Blu-ray version was released on March 29, 2011, which retained the special features of the Family Fun Edition.|$|R
40|$|Dirt {{and grit}} are common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste that resist removal by mechanical screening. The persistence {{of dirt and}} grit in wood-waste derived feedstocks tends to cause significant problems for the high value end use markets. For example, the presence of dirt and grit in composite panel board feedstocks causes excessive equipment wear in the manufacturing plant {{as well as for}} the end users of panel board products. For the manufacturing plant, dirt and grit causes refiner plates in the size reduction equipment to wear down at a faster rate than normal. For the end-user, dirt and grit embedded in the panel board causes saw blades to dull more rapidly. Dirt and grit can also reduce the brightness of a panel board which may be a problem for end users who overlay the board with thin melamines or other coatings. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the use of chip washing equipment to remove persistent dirt and grit contaminants from recovered wood waste feedstocks for users of exceptionally clean supplies of wood waste. Mechanical screening for <b>dirt</b> and grit <b>removal</b> is adequate. Chip Washer. A chip washer operates by mixing wood waste feedstocks with water. The mixing process needs to be fairly dynamic to remove dirt and grit. The energetic mixing can be accomplished through an enclosed ‘waterfall’, turbulent pumping, or other mechanisms. Once the dirt and grit is washed free fro...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} Brahmana, the seer asks about {{the method of}} Bhasma snana ("ash-bath"), {{smearing}} one with Bhasma. Kalagni Rudra tells about two types: Malasnana (bathing for <b>dirt</b> <b>removal)</b> and Vidhisnana (bathing by rituals). Malasnana is application of Bhasma on the entire body; mantras for application on the body are told. Vidhisnana is application of the Bhasma on specific {{parts of the body}} like head, face, chest, feet and [...] "secret parts" [...] (groin). The mantras for the same are listed. Further, times when the Bhasma snana should be done are told, e.g. twilight, after eating, after touching a woman, cat, eagle etc. While worshipping gods, the guru, sages or approaching the sacred fire or in places of impurity, the Tripundra, the Shaiva tilaka in form of three horizontal lines of ash, are recommended to be applied. Bhusunda probes about the rules of Tripundra further. The Tripundra is prescribed by Kalagni Rudra to be applied on 32, 16, 8 or 5 spots on the body, which are listed along with the presiding deities of those locations. Instead of the complete Bhasma snana, Tripundra {{can be applied to the}} elbows, forearms, back, head, and forehead; the mantras, presiding deities of application on each part as well as the sin which is destroyed by the application on the specific part, is told. For example, applying the mantra on the chest/heart is done by invoking the fire-god Agni and is said to destroy sins committed by the mind.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Fossil Fighters did {{a fairly}} well job of addicting players {{to the task}} of unearthing prehistoric creatures to do battle. It's obvious Fossil Fighters: Champions follows the first game very closely, adding a few small items but keeping the framework that proved effective. Those seeking deep combat or story mechanics will not find them here, but the addictive nature of trying to fill a complete library of prehistoric pugilists will win over quite a few. Some of them can be purchased in shops or obtained as rewards for quests, but most simply need the player to wonder around the many areas within the game where fossils are easily unearthed with a little digging in the right spot. A handy sonar is provided to showcase exactly where these spots are, and raking in the fossils is quick and easy. Once some fossils have been gathered, the job of cleaning them can begin. Using a hammer for pounding and a drill for more sensitive parts, scraping all the eons' worth of accumulated dirt off of the fossils must be done before they can be used. The twin catches of this process are a ninety-second time limit and the inherent fragility of an exposed fossil, which can make a rush job injurious to the specimen. The time limit can be irritating, {{but most of the time}} it is not usually a major issue. The use of the DS touch screen for the cleaning is quite enjoyable, and dusting a dozen or more fossils in one sustained session becomes commonplace due to the addictiveness of the procedure. The developers were thoughtful enough to make the accumulated dirt come in many shapes and densities, ensuring that every cleaning is not the same. Champions adds a few elements to the cleaning. Now gigantic fossils that take up more than the screen can display will be found, and the cleaning of these requires manually moving the viewpoint. Consumable items can now be purchased to aid <b>dirt</b> <b>removal,</b> one of which will add thirty seconds to the timer while the other will identify any break points to instantly smash open a large chunk of the fossil.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{restoration}} of old film archives has become of increasing {{interest in the}} last few years with the rise of consumer digital video applications and the need to supply more programming material of an acceptable quality in a multimedia context. A technique is described for the optimization of multidimensional grayscale soft morphological filters for applications in automatic film archive restoration, specific to the problem of film <b>dirt</b> <b>removal.</b> The optimization is undertaken with respect to a criterion based on mean absolute error and is performed using a genetic algorithm. Experiments have shown that the filter found using this technique has excellent performance in attenuating/removing film dirt from image sequences and has little, if any, effect on the image detail. The results of applying such a filter to a real image sequence were analyzed and compared to those obtained by restoring the same image sequence using a global filtering approach (LUM filter) and a spatio-temporal local filtering approach (ML 3 Dex filter with noise detection). From a film <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> point of view, the optimized soft morphological filter showed improved results compared to the LUM filter and comparable results with respect to the ML 3 Dex filter with noise detection. Also, the optimized filter accurately restored all fast-moving objects present in the sequence, without the need for motion compensation, whereas the other two methods failed to do this. The proposed method proved to be a simple, fast, and cheap approach for the automatic {{restoration of}} old film archives...|$|E

40|$|The {{main tasks}} of conservators of artworks and monuments are the {{estimation}} {{and analysis of}} damages (present condition), object conservation (cleaning process), {{and the protection of}} an object against further degradation. One of the physical methods that {{is becoming more and more}} popular for <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> is the laser cleaning method. This method is non-contact, selective, local, controlled, self-limiting, gives immediate feedback and preserves even the gentlest of relief - the trace of a paintbrush. Paper presents application of different, selected physical sensing methods to characterize condition of works of art as well as laser cleaning process itself. It includes, tested in our laboratories, optical surface measurements (e. g. colorimetry, scatterometry, interferometry), infrared thermography, optical coherent tomography and acoustic measurements for Ã¢Â€Âœon-lineÃ¢Â€Â evaluation of cleaning progress.

40|$|Self-cleaning and anti-fogging {{technology}} is already {{used in a}} variety of the products today, among which glazing products prevail. Their function is based on the two principles, either hydrophobic (Lotus effect) or photocatalytic hydrophilic principle. In the latter case, self-cleaning action is based on the combination of photocatalysis and photoinduced superhydrophilicity, where <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> by uniform spreading of water over the whole surface is improved with photocatalytic decomposition of organic contaminants. There is a big room to play and a huge potential to improve the properties of existing self-cleaning and anti-fogging surfaces by designing and tailoring new nanoarchitectures of the light-activated thin films. In this lecture we report about the latest achievements and relevance of nanostructured metal oxide surfaces for specific application in photocatalytic self cleaning. The emphasis is given to the preparation and structure-property relationship of nanocomposite materials based on TiO 2 (TiO 2 -SiO 2) and ZnO (ZnO/Co 3 O 4).

40|$|Purpose of review: More {{evidence}} is emerging {{on the role}} of cleaning and decontamination for reducing hospital-acquired infection. Timely and adequate removal of environmental pathogens leads to measurable clinical benefits for patients. This article considers studies published from 2013 examining hospital decontamination technologies and evidence for cost-effectiveness. Recent findings: Novel biocides and cleaning products, antimicrobial coatings, monitoring practices and automated equipment are widely accessible. They do not necessarily remove all environmental pathogens, however, and most have yet to be comprehensively assessed against patient outcome. Some studies are confounded by concurrent infection control and/or antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. Few contain data on costs. Summary: As automated <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> is assumed to be superior to human effort, there is a danger that traditional cleaning methods are devalued or ignored. Fear of infection encourages use of powerful disinfectants for eliminating real or imagined pathogens in hospitals without appreciating toxicity or cost benefit. Furthermore, efficacy of these agents is compromised without prior removal of organic soil. Microbiocidal activity should be compared and contrasted against physical removal of soil in standardized and controlled studies to understand how best to manage contaminated healthcare environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this diplomawork is a {{comparison}} between two different wet cleaning methods for tapestries. The first method investigated is traditional wet cleaning in a basin, where the tapestry, when treated with natural sponges, lies {{under the surface of}} a water solution. The second method is wet cleaning with aerosol suction, where the watersolution is appleid as an aerosol and the tapestry is treated with suction from a low pressure table. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish an appreciation of two modern wet cleaning methods for tapestries. How efficient in matter of <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> are the different methods? How does the dirt appear on the textile fibres before and after wet cleaning, if some dirt remains? Does the mechanical treatment of the two different methods lead to damage of the textile fibres? The two wet cleaning methods have been performed on naturally soiled and degraded pieces of tapestry weave. Methods for analysis have been transmission microscopy, stereo microscopy and ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy). Some images are presented in this report.

40|$|Abstract More {{evidence}} is emerging {{on the importance}} of the clinical environment in encouraging hospital infection. This review considers the role of cleaning as an effective means to control infection. It describes the location of pathogen reservoirs and methods for evaluating hospitals’ cleanliness. Novel biocides, antimicrobial coatings and equipment are available, many of which have not been assessed against patient outcome. Cleaning practices should be tailored to clinical risk, given the wide-ranging surfaces, equipment and building design. There is confusion between nursing and domestic personnel over the allocation of cleaning responsibilities and neither may receive sufficient training and/or time to complete their duties. Since less labourious practices for <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> are always attractive, there is a danger that traditional cleaning methods are forgotten or ignored. Few studies have examined detergent-based regimens or modelled these against infection risk for different patient categories. Fear of infection encourages the use of powerful disinfectants for the elimination of real or imagined pathogens in hospitals. Not only do these agents offer false assurance against contamination, their disinfection potential cannot be achieved without the prior removal of organic soil. Detergent-based cleaning is cheaper than using disinfectants and much less toxic. Hospital cleaning in the 21 st century deserves further investigation for routine and outbreak practices...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the belief}} of the {{researchers}} at the University of Nebraska Experiment Station that all vacuum cleaners should be compared on the same basis and by the same test procedure. Hence, after reviewing existing test procedures, {{it was concluded that}} the problem was to develop a test method for evaluating the <b>dirt</b> <b>removal</b> ability of vacuum cleaners where all cleaners would be compared on the same basis. Since this problem would include both on-the-floor and above-the-floor cleaning, and further, since the primary function of the vacuum cleaner as considered to be the cleaning of rugs and carpets, the investigation was soon restricted to the cleaning of rugs and carpets. The hypothesis on which this test procedure is based is: First, the use of artificially soiled rugs allows the amount of dirt in the rug to be measured. The use of naturally soiled rugs does not allow one to know how much dirt is in the rug; hence, this type of test is useful mainly for comparing one cleaner with another. Second, the synthetic dirt sample should contain organic matter because the analyses of 105 samples of vacuum cleaner sweepings from forty states showed that carpet sweepings contain almost 50 per cent organic matter, and, Third, reproducible results can be obtained by using synthetic dirt containing organic material, provided careful measurements are made and controlled techniques are used. Specifically, the problem is to devise a method of embedding a synthetic dirt in a rug with a minimum loss of dirt and then to find a method of removing the dirt from the rug such that reproducible results can be obtained. The data included in this report show that reproducible results were obtained by using the test procedure developed during this research. By following the suggested test procedure given in the summary, reproducible results can be obtained by others if careful measurements are made and the procedure is followed accurately.
