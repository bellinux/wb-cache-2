If e'er one vision touch thy infant thought, Of all the nurse {{and all the}} priest have taught; [...] 30 Of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen, The silver token, and the circled green, Or virgins visited by angel-powers, With golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers; Hear and believe! thy own importance know, Nor bound thy narrow views to things below. Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd, To maids alone and children are reveal'd: What though no credit doubting wits may give? The fair and innocent shall still believe. [...] 40 Know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, The light militia of the lower sky: These, though unseen, are ever on the wing, Hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring. Think what an equipage thou hast in air, And view with scorn two pages and a chair. As now your own, our beings were of old, And once enclosed in woman's beauteous mould; Thence, by a soft transition, we repair From earthly vehicles to these of air. [...] 50 Think not, when woman's transient breath is fled, That all her vanities at once are dead; Succeeding vanities she still regards, And though she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. Her joy in gilded chariots, when alive, And love of ombre, after death survive. For when the fair in all their pride <b>expire,</b> <b>To</b> their first elements their souls retire: The sprites of fiery termagants in flame Mount up, and take a Salamander's name. [...] 60 Soft yielding minds to water glide away, And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental tea. The graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome, In search of mischief still on earth to roam.

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to be able to say that you are my form--my envelope. But you are too {{beautiful}} for that!" [...] So Olive returned her friend's compliment; and later she said that, of course, it would be far easier to give up everything and draw the curtains to and pass one's life in an artificial atmosphere, with rose-coloured lamps. It would be far easier to abandon the struggle, to leave all the unhappy women of the world to their immemorial misery, to lay down one's burden, close one's eyes to the whole dark picture, and, in short, simply <b>expire.</b> <b>To</b> this Verena objected that it would not be easy for her to expire at all; that such an idea was darker than anything the world contained; that she had not done with life yet, and that she didn't mean to allow her responsibilities to crush her. And then the two young women concluded, as they had concluded before, by finding themselves completely, inspiringly in agreement, full of the purpose to live indeed, and with high success; to become great, in order not to be obscure, and powerful, in order not to be useless. Olive had often declared before that her conception of life was as something sublime or as nothing at all. The world was full of evil, but she was glad to have been born before it had been swept away, while it was still there to face, to give one a task and a reward. When the great reforms should be consummated, when the day of justice should have dawned, would not life perhaps be rather poor and pale? She had never pretended to deny that the hope of fame, of the very highest distinction, was one of her strongest incitements; and she held that the most effective way of protesting against the state of bondage of women was for an individual member of the sex to become illustrious. A person who might have overheard some of the talk of this possibly infatuated pair would have been touched by their extreme familiarity with the idea of earthly glory. Verena had not invented it, but she had taken it eagerly from her friend, and she returned it with interest. To Olive it appeared that just this partnership of their two minds--each of them, by itself, lacking an important group of facets--made an organic whole which, for the work in hand, could not fail to be brilliantly effective. Verena was often far more irresponsive than she liked to see her; but the happy thing in her composition was that, after a short contact with the divine idea--Olive was always trying to flash it at her, like a jewel in an uncovered case--she kindled, flamed up, took the words from her friend's less persuasive lips, resolved herself into a magical voice, became again the pure young sibyl. Then Olive perceived how fatally, without Verena's tender notes, her crusade would lack sweetness, what the Catholics call unction; and, on the other hand, how weak Verena would be on the statistical and logical side if she herself should not bring up the rear. Together, in short, they would be complete, they would have everything, and together they would triumph.|$|E

During the 1940s and 1950s, BMI was the primary licensing organization for Country artists and R&B artists, while ASCAP centered on more established Pop artists.

50|$|The {{resolution}} did {{include two}} unique provisions: First, it said {{up to four}} additional states could be created from Texas' territory {{with the consent of}} the State of Texas (and that new states north of the Missouri Compromise Line would be free states). Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution, the U.S. Constitution neither requires Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be ex post to applications nor to <b>expire.</b> <b>To</b> illustrate the strength of the latter caveat, the 27th Amendment was submitted to the states in 1789, yet was not ratified until 1992; thus, the expressed consent of Congress, via this resolution, to the creation of new states would not expire nor require renewal. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas owned by the federal government are those which were subsequently purchased by it. This also means the state government has control over oil reserves which were later used to fund the state's public university system through the Permanent University Fund. In addition, the state's control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 nautical leagues (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668 km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56 km) as with other states.|$|E

The computers residing in the classified environment are bound by security requirements of the Secure Classified Network (SCN) Security Plan. These security requirements delimited the scope of the project, specifically mandating validation of all user accounts on the central corporate computer systems. System administrators, in addition to their assigned responsibilities, were spending valuable hours performing the additional tacit responsibility of tracking user accountability for user-generated data. For example, in cases where the data originator was no longer an employee, the administrators were forced to spend considerable time and effort determining the appropriate management personnel to assume ownership or disposition of the former owner's data files. In order to prevent this sort of problem from occurring and to have a defined procedure {{in the event of an}} anomaly, the computer account management procedure was thoroughly reengineered, as detailed in this document.

This displays Dublin Core and other element metadata for the files that are attached to items. This can be accessed at the following relative URL in any Omeka installation: 'files/show/id', where ID is the unique numeric ID for the file (similar to items). See #Theme API improvements for more details. trac# 352, adds pagination capabilities to table classes and controllers. Omeka admin panel now shows pagination for lists of collections and users. Plugins can also use these improvements to implement pagination in a clean and simple fashion. trac# 65, implements autocomplete for adding tags via the admin interface. trac# 489, adds filtering/sorting criteria for users. Site administrators can now sort by username, first/last name, institution name, role, status (active/inactive). Can filter by role or status. trac# 459, adds an upgrade notification to the admin dashboard to tell users when {{a new version of}} Omeka is available (with a corresponding helper function, get_latest_omeka_version. trac# 158, enables JSONP for auto-serialized JSON requests. The javascript callback can be provided via the optional 'callback' parameter for any JSON request (output=json). JSONP responses are given the 'text/javascript' MIME type. This is different from the regular JSON MIME type ('application/json'). trac# 154, adds a 'Remember Me' option to the login form. This will maintain a user's session for 2 weeks from the moment of login. If 'Remember' is not checked, the session will expire when the browser session terminates. This also adds a 'session. name' field to the config. ini file and removes the pre-existing 'login. expire' setting. See Compatibility Issues for more details. If session name is not provided in the config file, the default session name will be automatically generated from the WEB_ROOT of the installation. A common use case for customizing the session name is so that session data could be shared across Omeka installations or with other applications running on the same server. Also added an 'initializeSession' phase to Omeka_Core, so that the session name could be properly configured prior to requests. Compatibility issues with 0. 10 'login. expire' setting was removed from the config. ini file. If you rely on this setting for determining the length of user sessions, tell your users instead to check 'Remember Me' when logging in through the admin. That is the same as setting login. <b>expire</b> <b>to</b> 2 weeks, and having the option of not extending the session is more secure on public computers. Many deprecated helper functions have been removed from the 1. 0 release of Omeka. Most of these were non-working as of 0. 10, but some {{may or may not have}} functioned correctly. In the interests of clarifying the API, these functions will not be available as of 1. 0. Using any of these functions within themes or plugins will now cause a fatal error: generate_url(options, name) dublin_core(type) metatext_form(item, input="textarea",metafields=null) items_rss_header() get_month(date) get_day(date) get_year(date) item_metadata(item, field, escape=true) type(id=null) types(array params = array()) tags(array params = array()) items(array params = array()) users(array params = array()) institutions(array params = array()) metafields(array params = array()) people(array params = array()) has_collection(item, name=null) has_files(item) item_types() collections(array params = array()) entities(array params = array()) has_collectors(collection) has_tags(item, array tags=array()) has_thumbnail(item) has_type(item, name=null) display_empty(val, alternative="[Empty]") get_base_url(use_relative_uri=false) is_current(link, req = null) link_to_thumbnail(item, props=array(), action='show', random=false) link_to_fullsize(item, props=array(), action='show', random=false) link_to_square_thumbnail(item, props=array(), action='show', random=false) _link_to_archive_image(item, props=array(), action='show', random=false, imageType = 'thumbnail') items_rss_uri(params=array()) item_permalink_url(item) define_metafield(name, description, type=null) add_theme_pages(dir, theme='both') add_controllers(dir='controllers') add_data_feed(format, options=array()) add_navigation(text, link, type='main', permissions=null) [3572] All Dublin Core elements on the items form are now plain text. The 'Language' and 'Date' elements are the ones affected by this change. The logic behind this change is that the previous form inputs (drop menu for language and YYYY/MM/DD date field) did not allow the full range of data entry that is implied by unqualified Dublin Core. In certain situations, data ingested from other systems may not have been possible to edit using Omeka. For example, if a date field containing 'May 10, 1932 ' was not converted to 1932 - 05 - 10 when ingested into the Omeka database, it would not be editable using the Omeka administrative interface. The value in 'path_to_convert' is changed from previous versions. This will not affect users with an up-to-date database. See Security Fixes for more details. API Improvements Plugin API Some helper functions have been added to simplify the task of ingesting data into Omeka from other systems. For more information about these helpers, see the codex or inline code documentation: insert_item(metadata = array(), elementTexts = array(), fileMetadata = array()) update_item(item, metadata = array(), elementTexts = array(), fileMetadata = array()) insert_collection(metadata = array()) trac# 488, insert_element_set(elementSet, array elements = array()) trac# 648, insert_files_for_item(item, transferStrategy, files, options = array()) [3710] release_object(var) : Can be used in plugins to avoid memory leaks. This encapsulates a workaround for PHP's built in garbage collection, which causes memory leaks when objects contain circular references. It does this by explicitly destroying an object instead of relying on PHP's garbage collection. Currently this only has a noticeable impact with record instances (classes extending Omeka_Record), though it may be extended to other classes in the future as needed. Caveats: This will destroy an object before automatic garbage collection would normally take over, so there may still be broken references to that object elsewhere in the application. This could cause problems when two plugins conflict with one another. For example, one plugin could store a reference to an Item record for future use, and a second plugin might release that record using release_object(). In this case, the first plugin would cease to work because of the second plugin's behavior. For this reason, release_object() should be avoided unless a memory leak crashes the plugin or otherwise interferes with its function. Example:item = insert_item(array('public'=>true), array()); release_object(item); Theme API trac# 479, a series of enhancements to display_files() : adds 'linkAttributes' and 'imgAttributes' options to display_files(). These are arrays that represent the XHTML attributes in the and tags, if applicable. adds support for displaying icons using display_files(). Users can now pass the 'icons' option as a keyed array of MIME types and paths to the respective icons. Here is a usage example from the code: changes the 3 rd argument of display files from a string (class attribute for the wrapping div) to an array (all attributes for the wrapping div). NOTE: This will break themes that relied on the previous behavior, but is easy to fix. the div that wraps each file now contains a class corresponding to the hyphenated MIME type of the file, i. e. learned 'linkToMetadata' option for the 'image', 'icon' and default callbacks. This is a boolean value that allows the theme writer to choose whether or not to link to the file's metadata page. This overrides the 'linkToFile' option and defaults to false. Here is an example of some of the new changes to display_files() : echo display_files_for_item(array('showFilename'=>false, 'linkToFile'=>false, 'linkAttributes'=>array('rel'=>'lightbox'), 'filenameAttributes'=>array('class'=>'random-class'), 'imgAttributes'=>array('class'=>'icon-image'), 'icons' => array('audio/mpeg'=>img('audio. gif')))); trac# 641, enhancements to show_item_metadata() : adds a 'show_element_sets' option. This allows a theme writer to choose to show specific element sets for an item. The theme writer can also choose to show all item type metadata for the item by putting 'Item Type Metadata' in the list (or the more specific name for certain item types, like 'Document Item Type Metadata'). adds a 'return_type' option. This option can be either 'array' or 'html' (default is 'html'). It allows a theme writer to retrieve the output from show_item_metadata() as an array to more easily enable custom markup. item() : Adds a fourth item argument to be able to display element metadata for an arbitrary Item record. Adds 'Permalink' metadata retrieval. Example: echo item('Permalink'); [...] > [URL] trac# 485, item_file(), show_file_metadata(), and the file metadata page: There is now a files/show page that can be displayed on every theme. By default, this page is located in the shared view scripts directory, application/views/scripts/files/show. php. If you would like to customize the markup for this file within your theme, copy this file from the shared directory to a files/ directory in your public theme and modify accordingly. item_file() helper has been added to facilitate display of metadata associated with files. It behaves similarly to item() when displaying Dublin Core or other element sets, though the arbitrary metadata associated with files is different than it is for files. The following metadata can be displayed for files: 'Id' 'Archive Filename' 'Original Filename' 'Size' 'Mime Type' 'Date Added' 'Date Modified' 'Authentication' 'Mime Type OS' 'File Type OS' 'Uri' 'Fullsize Uri' 'Thumbnail Uri' 'Square Thumbnail Uri' 'Permalink' show_file_metadata() helper has been added to facilitate listing file metadata in the same vein as show_item_metadata() for items. The main difference between this and show_item_metadata() is that it can display the 'MIME Type Metadata' element set, which displays all the metadata that was programmatically extracted from the file when it was first uploaded to Omeka. link_to_file_metadata() helper has been added to facilitate linking to the new file metadata page within themes. Security Fixes [3706] Fixed a security hole where the 'path_to_convert' admin setting could be replaced with an arbitrary command that would be executed when derivative images were created. The solution was to change the 'path_to_convert' setting so that it only represents the directory containing the ImageMagick binaries (not the binary itself). This should be fixed automatically when upgrading existing databases to 1. 0. [3587] Fixed a potential security hole involving JSON outputs. It was discovered that the default JSON output for users included the user's password hash. JSON outputs are protected by the ACL, so the password hash would only be available to super users, who can change passwords arbitrarily anyway. Still, this could have become a vulnerability in the future. The solution was to remove all default non-HTML outputs (including JSON) from controllers, thus forcing controller writers to enable alternative output formats explicitly using Zend Framework's ContextSwitch action helper. This reduces the chances of accidentally exposing sensitive data to the end user. The down side is that it may break plugins that rely on the existence of default 'JSON' outputs. Internal Changes Upgrades Zend Framework to 1. 7. 5. trac# 651, completely overhauled the File model. Prior to 1. 0, the File model handled everything to do with files, including uploading files, extracting metadata from the files, and creating derivative images. This splits those components into separate classes (Omeka_File_Ingest, Omeka_File_Info, and Omeka_File_Derivative_Image, respectively). The File model is now represented by the following 4 classes: Omeka_File_Ingest [...] In charge of ingesting files into Omeka, either through direct uploads (form POSTs), urls, or filesystem paths. This can also be extended to allow additional methods of file transfer by passing instances of classes that adhere to Omeka_File_Transfer_Adapter_Interface. Omeka_File_Info [...] Extracts additional metadata from files. This extracts the same metadata as in 0. 10. It has the most room for improvement of all the new file classes. Of particular interest in future development would be to revamp the algorithm that it uses to determine what metadata fields to populate. Omeka_File_Derivative_Image [...] Creates derivative images when given the path to the original file. Like Omeka_File_Info, this will run automatically when a file is inserted into the Omeka database. This is not meant to be invoked by plugin writers. List of Bugs Fixed in 1. 0 Fixes trac# 626 Images for items show have alt attribute for the display_files function. Fixes trac# 623 Make list tab on admin/items/browse appear selected when first going to the page. Fixes trac# 622 Alert on forgot password page breaks layout, adds images for submit-small and submit-extran small submit inputs. Fixes trac# 632, plugins should be able to add view scripts without adding controllers or a controllers directory. Fixes trac# 630, class autoloader needs to check entire include path. Fixes trac# 650, ElementSet::addElements() overwrites existing elements. Now, the order is relative to the other elements being added, which prevents overwriting. Fixes trac# 634, Dublin Core elements should be text areas, adds a migration. Fixes trac# 652, session namespace error using Zend Framework 1. 7. 4. Fixes a potential security issue where the database object was partially serialized into JSON for Omeka_Record objects. Fixes a potential security hole involving default JSON outputs for controllers. This removes the default action contexts from Omeka_Controller_Action and adds them to each relevant controller. The default action contexts were 'json', 'rss 2 ' and 'dc' for 'browse' actions, and 'json' and 'dc' for 'show' actions. This not make sense for most controllers, since RSS and Dublin Core are only for the ItemsController. It also opened up a security hole where sensitive data could have been passed to an attacker through the automatically serialized JSONP output. Note that this breaks backwards compatibility for any plugin controllers that extend off Omeka_Controller_Action, but only if those controllers rely on the default existence of the 'json' output for 'browse' and 'show' actions. Refs trac# 485, fixes a filter so that a plugin writer can do array('Display', 'File', [...] .) to filter element text displayed for files. Refs trac# 485, fixes a bug where filtering the element text so that it is blank should show the '[no text]' value for the RecordMetadataList helper. Refs trac# 485, fixes a bug in RecordMetadata helper where filters were not being properly invoked for arbitrary fields like 'Archive Filename' or 'Date Added'. Fixes styling on install form, adds closing tag to dashboard. Fixes trac# 613, query string vars not sent when redirecting users to the admin panel. Fixes trac# 647, Item view helper needs to be able to be called inside filters. Now item() can be called inside a filter that normally runs inside of another call to item(), so the API can be used to filter one element based on the value of another element. Fixes trac# 640 Themes admin panel layout busted with lots of themes in directory. Fixes trac# 657 Make uninstall button on plugins list red. Adds border above Save Item/Delete item on items/edit form, hides the Elements header on item-type/add if there are no element associated with an item-type. Fixes trac# 653 Hide the 'remove' link from single dublin core fields on item/add form. Fixes trac# 516 remove element button on item-types/edit doesn't prompt for confirm. Fixes trac# 665 'Use HTML' checkbox on items form was broken in IE 7. Fixes trac# 661 Link to Omeka archive in installer broken on subdomains.
