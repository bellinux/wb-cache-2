5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>dropping</b> the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange <b>for</b> <b>dropping</b> charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E

5|$|In August, the Japanese {{government}} refused surrender demands as specifically {{outlined in}} the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of mainland Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule <b>for</b> <b>dropping</b> the two available bombs. Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000 dead. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day.|$|E
5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return <b>for</b> <b>dropping</b> his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.|$|E

40|$|The Leidenfrost {{effect is}} studied <b>for</b> <b>drops</b> on a {{superheated}} yet non-volatile liquid pool, and {{contrasted with the}} more classical situation implying a solid substrate. Experiments reveal {{the absence of a}} critical superheat <b>for</b> <b>drops</b> to “levitate” over the roughness-free liquid surface, even when the latter is significantly deformed (i. e. <b>for</b> large <b>drops).</b> Inspired from a previous work, a theoretical model is presented which compares fairly well to experiments without any fitting parameter. Contrary to the case of a solid substrate, the vapor film here does not appear to form chimneys, even <b>for</b> large <b>drops.</b> The evaporation dynamics is also studied, and scaling laws are discussed versus classical ones. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return <b>for</b> <b>dropping</b> any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing <b>for</b> <b>dropping.</b> The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E
