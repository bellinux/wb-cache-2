40|$|Background & aim: Nowadays, Diabetes is {{prevalent}} in different societies, and hyperlipidemia {{is one of}} the important outcomes and effective in the development of complications from this disease. Therefore, finding a medication to reduce hyperlipidemia without an adverse effects on blood sugar levels has always been investigated. Some studies have been reported the beneficial effects of the aerial parts of Anethum graveolens on lipid levels in the clinical and animal models. As there is no study on the effect of <b>dill</b> <b>seed</b> extract on blood lipid levels in diabetic rats; the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the <b>dill</b> <b>seed</b> extract on lipid profile in diabetic rats. Methods: In this experimental study, 24 rats with a weight range of 200 to 250 g were randomly divided into three groups of eight, including normal group, diabetic group (received normal saline) and diabetic group (received seed extract to 100 mg /kg). To induce diabetes, the rats were received streptozocin (50 mg /kg,) intraperitoneally. The <b>dill</b> <b>seed</b> extract was given for four weeks and then the blood samples were collected to measure LDL, HDL and triglyceride. The differences between the control and treatment groups were tested by one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. Results: Induction of diabetes significantly increased the serum concentration of LDL and triglycerides compared with the control group (p= 0. 001), but no effect was seen on HDL levels. Dill Oral administration of seed extract-dose (100 mg/kg) animal serum concentration of LDL significantly reduced in comparison with diabetic group (p= 0. 001). The triglyceride serum levels was significantly reduced compared to diabetic group after 4 weeks administration of <b>dill</b> <b>seed</b> extract (p< 0. 001), but no effect was observed on HDL in comparison to diabetic group (p= 0. 54). Conclusion: The results showed that the <b>dill</b> <b>seed</b> extract was able to reduce the serum levels of LDL and triglyceride in the diabetic rats.

5000|$|In Sweden, dill is {{a common}} spice or herb. The top of fully grown dill is called {{krondill}} (English: Crown dill); this is used when cooking crayfish. The krondill is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is stored in refrigerator for at least 24 hours before eating (with toasted bread and butter). Krondill is also used for cucumber pickles. Small cucumbers, sliced or not, are put into a solution of hot water, mild acetic vinegar (not made from wine and without colour), sugar and krondill. After a month or two, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce and potatoes, as a [...] "sweetener". The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (as the first potatoes for the year, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). It is used together with, or instead of other green herbs, like parsley, chives and basil, in salads. It is also often paired up with chives when used in food. Dill {{is often used to}} flavour fish and seafood in Sweden, for example gravlax and various herring pickles, among them the traditional sill i dill (literally [...] "herring in dill"). In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called dillkött, which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains either pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. <b>Dill</b> <b>seeds</b> may be used in breads or akvavit.

The experimental group received 1 ml of mentioned dose and the control group received 1 ml distilled water daily for a period of 10 days. At the end of the experiment, the rats in the estrus phase were anesthetized and blood samples were taken from the dorsal aorta for more investigations. Ovaries and uterus tissue sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin - eosin and Masson tri-chrome for morphometry by light microscopy. Levels of progesterone and estradiol levels were measured by radioimmunoassay and ELISA. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results: Serum levels of progesterone and estradiol groups showed no significant difference between the experimental and the control group (P> 0. 05).

Carvone also contributed more than limonene in inhibiting the growth of S. sclerotiorum. Carvone and limonene synergistically inhibited {{the growth of the}} fungus. In vivo experiments, the essential oil remarkably suppressed S. sclerotiorum, and considerable morphological alterations were observed in the hyphae and sclerotia. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, malate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase activities, and external medium acidification were investigated to elucidate the antifungal mechanism of the essential oil. The seed essential oil of A. graveolens can be extensively used in agriculture for preventing the oilseed crops fungal disease...|$|R
