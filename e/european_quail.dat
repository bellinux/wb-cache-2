40|$|International audienceSince the 1970 s, {{the decline}} of the occidental populations of <b>European</b> <b>Quail</b> Coturnix c. coturnix, a partial migrant Galliform species, has driven the release of {{domestic}} Japanese Quail Coturnix c. japonica into the wild as game birds. Recent experiments suggest that reproductive isolating mechanisms have not developed to prevent hybridization between European and Japanese Quail. To assess the potential impact of hybridization between the subspecies in the wild, this study aims to compare the migratory characteristics of captive <b>European</b> <b>Quail,</b> domestic Japanese Quail, F 1 hybrids and a backcross. In a laboratory experiment, birds hatched in summer and reared under a natural photoperiod were transferred during winter to an artificial photoperiod (light–dark) of 14 : 10 h. Behavioural (migratory restlessness, crowing activity in males) and physiological (sexual development, fat accumulation, body mass) measures were recorded. Domestic Japanese Quail showed no migratory tendency in response to the increased day length. F 1 hybrids showed rapid sexual development and few of them exhibited the typical profile of a migrant bird. Backcrosses showed great variation in their response, comparable with those of the <b>European</b> <b>Quail.</b> Therefore, hybridization could lead to an increased proportion of quail showing sedentary rather than migratory behaviour.

In this context, the aim of this study was the development and validation of models using fuzzy logic for predicting climate indices and productive performance of <b>European</b> <b>quails</b> kept in a climatic chamber. The model developed was analyzed from two points of view; the first one took into account the prediction of climate indexes where the input variables were the temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) of the air. In the second, related to the prediction of productive performance, the input variables were air temperature (°C) and age of the birds (weeks) while the output variables were the food intake (FI, g), water consumption (WC, g), weight gain (WG, g) and food conversion (FC g g- 1) of the birds. The Mamdani method was used for the preparation of the rules, and in the defuzzification was applied the center of gravity method.

40|$|Restocking with {{non-native}} {{species for}} hunting purposes {{is a widespread}} practice in some Galliformes species that may result in the introgression of maladaptive alleles into native populations. Quails farmed for restocking are produced by interbreeding domestic Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) with European quails (Coturnix coturnix). Massive releases of these animals could represent a threat to native European quails. In this study we radio-track 16 female native European quails and 51 female farm-reared quails over four breeding seasons in a single locality. Our results show that farmed female quails attracted more wild common quail males than <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> females, probably because they produce more rally calls. Here {{for the first time}} we show empirical evidence that European quails and restocked farmed quails interbreed in the wild. Further, hybrid farmed females and European females had similar probabilities of mating, nesting success, clutch size, fertility, hatching probability and chicks’ survival probability. However, female farmed quail had higher mortality than <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> females, and their nests had a higher rate of predation. These last observations could explain why the two lineages do not appear completely admixed after more than 20 years of massive restocking practices. However, our results clearly show a lack of reproductive barriers in the wild and that introgression may not be completely prevented. An immediate ban of the release of non-native quails is necessary to preserve their genetic integrity. Thus, banning restocking with Japanese quail or hybrids is necessary to prevent the progressive introduction of maladaptive alleles into the <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> populations.

One {{study showed that}} this is a quite {{dangerous}} hunting style. More than 300 Cooper's hawk skeletons were investigated and 23% revealed healed fractures in the bones of the chest. Cooper's hawks prey almost exclusively on small to mid-sized birds. Typical prey species include American robins, other thrushes, jays, woodpeckers, <b>European</b> starlings, <b>quail,</b> icterids, cuckoos, pigeons and doves. Birds preyed on can range in size from wood-warblers to ring-necked pheasants.

They have been known to rob nests and may supplement their diet with small mammals such as chipmunks, hares, mice, squirrels, and bats. Even more rarely, they may prey on lizards, frogs, or snakes. It normally catches its prey with its feet and kills it by repeatedly squeezing it and holding it away from its body until it dies. They have also been seen drowning their prey, holding it underwater until it stops moving. The hawks often pluck the feathers off their prey on a post or other perch. They also hunt songbirds at backyard feeders, perching nearby then swooping down and scattering the birds to single one out in flight.

Comparison based on these three parameters for each form of vocalization showed that more than 80 % of individuals were correctly discriminated thus permitting fairly reliable counts of populations in the field. Intra-individual variations of parameters of male triplets linked with sexual development or age could permit sexual selection of singing males by females.

Research about the functional value of this temporal organization in the field thus seems justified. At an individual level, two distinct laying profiles were recorded, as in a previous experiment on an industrial Japanese quail strain selected for meat and egg production. However, different frequencies were noted.

Evolution of behaviour is difficult to investigate on a large timescale since it does not 'fossilize'.

I also observed vocal changes in hybrid crows during the breeding season and from one year to the other. This vocal variability resembles those observed during the ontogeny of the crow in quails.

Evolution of behaviour is difficult to investigate on a large timescale since it does not ‘fossilize’. Here I propose that calls of hybrid non-songbirds that develop without the influence of learning may help in understanding the gradual process that leads to vocal divergence during speciation. I recorded crows produced by the <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> (Coturnix c. coturnix), the domestic Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica) and their hybrids (F 1, F 2 and backcrosses). Most crowing patterns were intermediate to those of the parental species; some were similar to one or the other parental species, or not present in either parental species. I also observed vocal changes in hybrid crows during the breeding season and from one year to the other. This vocal variability resembles those observed during the ontogeny of the crow in quails. It is likely that similar mechanisms involved in vocal changes during ontogeny might have driven vocal divergence in the species of Palearctic quails. I suggest that hybrid crows might have resembled those produced b...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the requirements for maintenance and gain of crude protein in Japanese and European quails aged 16 - 36 days. To determine the maintenance requirements, one experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four decreasing feeding levels (100, 75, 50 and 25 %) and four replicates per treatment. The method of comparative slaughter was used, through a feeding assay. A total of 352 quails from each strain were housed by supply level in 16 pens measuring 1. 0 × 1. 5 m, totaling 22 birds per cage under ambient temperature conditions (26 ± 0. 5 ºC). To estimate the requirement gains, one experiment was conducted with five groups of quails fed ad libitum and housed under controlled temperature of 18 ºC. All poultry were slaughtered at 16, 21, 26, 31 and 36 days of testing for determination of body composition in protein throughout growth. The requirement for maintenance of the Japanese quail differs from that obtained with the <b>European</b> <b>quail.</b> The protein was retained at the proportion of 32 % for European quails and 25 % for the Japanese quails. This difference in retention promoted estimate of 0. 65 g/g gain in European quails and 0. 84 g/g gain in Japanese quails. Quails should be fed diets formulated considering the requirement for protein of each genotype...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000246297100004 International audienceTemporal {{characteristics}} ofmigratory {{behavior in}} birds are usually {{studied at the}} species and population levels, and rarely at the individual level. Variations among species and populations of the seasonal onset of migratory behavior have been widely investigated, but very {{little is known about}} its daily organization or whether birds are conservative in their behavior. The determination of intra- and inter-individual variability is important for the study of genetic variations and can reveal the existence of different adaptation capacities within populations. This laboratory study analyzed intra- nd inter-individual variability of daily initiation and time course of nocturnal restlessness in partial-migrant <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> (Coturnix coturnix coturnix). Thirty-five quail were selected randomly from a captive stock, and their spring activity was recorded under natural daylenghs. Eighteen of the thirty-five quail presented behavioral profiles of migrant birds. Migrantbirds initiated their nocturnal activity punctually, and the time courses of the nocturnal activity of 88 % of them revealed intra-individual stability over six consecutive nights. All birds initiated their nocturnal activity after sunset and civil twilight, and they were more active at the beginning than the middle or end of the night, suggesting that their drive to migrate could be synchronized with particular skylight conditions. For the first time, stable individual profiles in the daily time course of migratory restlessness are shown. These results support previous findings concerning biological rhythms of quail and raise questions concerning the timing of migratory behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of age (85, 140, and 270 days) of European quails breeders on the egg quality and hatching, fertility and progeny performance was evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement (females' age x males' age), with ten replicates and six birds per experimental unit (four females and two males). Egg production and quality were determined during 3 periods of 14 days and incubation parameters were evaluated in eggs obtained in five consecutive days. The live {{performance of the}} progenies was analyzed until 35 days. There was no effect of male age or any interaction between the age {{of males and females}} for the evaluated variable. The female's age influenced egg production, egg weight and chick weight, with better results obtained for 140 -d-old breeders. The age of females reduced the hatchability, increased the late mortality in incubated eggs, and had no effect on fertility, total embryo mortality or eggshell structure, when analyzed by electron microscopy. The number of sperm trapped in the outer perivitelline layer (sptz/mm&# 178;) was determined in 10 fertile eggs per experimental unit. Young females fertilized by young males (80 days) had reduced sptz/mm&# 178;. Progeny live performance was not affected by breeder's age. Breeders with 270 days retain fertility; however, their egg production, weight and hatchability of fertilized eggs is reduced. In conclusion, <b>European</b> <b>quail</b> breeders with 140 days of age have better egg quality, hatching and breeding results...|$|E
