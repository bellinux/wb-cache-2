5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing <b>dental</b> <b>x-ray</b> films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E

25|$|Dosage due to dental X-rays varies {{significantly}} {{depending on}} the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single <b>dental</b> <b>X-ray</b> of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A full mouth series of X-rays may result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{chest x-ray}} {{delivers}} 0.02mSv (2 mrem) of effective dose. A <b>dental</b> <b>x-ray</b> delivers {{a dose of}} 5 to 10 µSv. A CT scan delivers an effective dose to the whole body ranging from 1 to 20 mSv (100 to 2000 mrem). The average American receives about 3mSv of diagnostic medical dose per year; countries with the lowest levels of health care receive almost none. Radiation treatment for various diseases also accounts for some dose, both in individuals and in those around them.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} meningiomas {{are not well}} understood. Most cases are sporadic, {{appearing}} randomly, while some are familial. Persons who have undergone radiation, especially to the scalp, are more at risk for developing meningiomas, as {{are those who have}} had a brain injury. Atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer that they were {{to the site of the}} explosion. Dental x-rays are correlated with an increased risk of meningioma, in particular for people who had frequent dental x-rays in the past, when the x-ray dose of a <b>dental</b> <b>x-ray</b> was higher than in the present.|$|E

40|$|Many {{observational}} {{studies have}} found that exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>X-rays</b> is associated with the risk of development of meningioma. However, these findings are inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>X-rays</b> and the risk of development of meningioma. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Summary odds ratio (OR) estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to compute the risk of meningioma development according to heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to further explore the potential heterogeneity. Finally, publication bias was assessed. Seven case-control studies involving 6, 174 patients and 19, 459 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Neither exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>X-rays</b> nor performance of full-mouth panorex X-rays was associated with an increased risk of development of meningioma (overall: OR, 0. 97; 95 % CI, 0. 70 - 1. 32; dental X-rays: OR, 1. 05; 95 % CI, 0. 89 - 1. 25; panorex X-rays: OR, 1. 01; 95 % CI, 0. 76 - 1. 34).

25|$|To {{place the}} {{increased}} risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose {{a person to}} the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a <b>dental</b> <b>X-ray</b> is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation. Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4–5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000. This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime. For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the absorbed dose is about 14 mGy. A head CT scan (1.5mSv, 64mGy) that is performed once with and once without contrast agent, would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head. Accurate estimation of effective doses due to CT is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about ±19% to ±32% for adult head scans depending upon the method used.|$|E

40|$|Although {{diagnostic}} x-ray procedures {{provide important}} medical benefits, cancer {{risks associated with}} their exposure are also possible, but not well characterized. The US Radiologic Technologists Study (1983 – 2006) is a nationwide, prospective cohort study with extensive questionnaire data on history of personal diagnostic imaging procedures collected prior to cancer diagnosis. We used Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate thyroid cancer risks related to the number and type of selected procedures. We assessed potential modifying effects of age and calendar year of the first x-ray procedure in each category of procedures. Incident thyroid cancers (n = 251) were diagnosed among 75, 494 technologists (1. 3 million person-years; mean follow-up = 17 years). Overall, there was no clear evidence of thyroid cancer risk associated with diagnostic <b>x-rays</b> except for <b>dental</b> <b>x-rays.</b> We observed a 13 % increase in thyroid cancer risk for every 10 reported dental radiographs (hazard ratio = 1. 13, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01, 1. 26), which was driven by <b>dental</b> <b>x-rays</b> first received before 1970, but we {{found no evidence that}} the relationship between <b>dental</b> <b>x-rays</b> and thyroid cancer was associated with child-hood or adolescent exposures as would have been anticipated.
