40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} a {{reflection}} about {{the different types of}} models of urban growth in relation to the territorial natural context, it means an investigation about those relationships established between natural environment and human involvement which often, and especially in recent years, have generated not a few conflicts in the balance among urban / non-urban combination. Certainly, the urbanization process is affected by natural and administrative factors, {{but it is clear that}} there is a tendency to occupy the most productive and most profitable portions of landscape. If we look at how urbanization has spread over territory during the last twenty or thirty years, and we concentrate on its forms of occupying the soil, we have the clear <b>suspect</b> that urbanization, <b>above</b> <b>all</b> in the Mediterranean area, and even more toward the immediate coastal line, has underwent a process of uncontrolled, uncoordinated planning, almost without care for environmental problems. An important piece of evidence is that, in 2006, the first kilometre of coastal territory, along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, was 30 % urbanized; this percentage, which was as low as 22 % in 1990, goes down flatly already in the second kilometre (16 % in 2006) to reach very low values at a distance of 20 or 40 kilometres...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} reinvestigated the phosphohexose {{isomerase}} (PHI) serum activity in 60 patients with prostatic hypertrophy and cancer with the enzymatic procedure of Noltman, more accurate and sensitive than the colorimetric method used by Bodansky and other authors. The PHI activity varied from 20 mU to 30 mU in normal subjects, while {{in patients with}} prostatic hypertrophy it varied from 60 mU to 80 mU. In prostatic carcinoma it was constantly above 110 mU. In normal subjects and in prostatic cancer, the enzymatic assay values were lower than those reported by Bodansky. In all cases the diagnosis was confirmed by bioptic inspection. An important fact was that extremely high values (not included in the mean) {{have been found in}} some patients with widely diffused metastasis. Considering also the few intermediate values which cannot be easily included in the reported groups (between 30 and 50 mU in 1 normal subject, and 2 prostatic hypertrophies; between 70 and 90 mU in 2 prostatic hypertrophies and 3 cancers), the present investigation shows that the enzymatic assay of PHI may be clinically very interesting. It provides selective values for the diagnosis not only between prostatic hypertrophy and cancer but also in cases of hypertrophy with single <b>suspected</b> nests, and, <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> in cancer metastatized. The method is much more worthy, about 90 %, than those of serum phosphatases, which reach, by Cavazzana, 75 % at least...|$|R

60|$|Now Nada told Umslopogaas {{of those}} words which she had bandied with Zinita, and the Slaughterer was troubled. Yet, because of his foolishness and of the {{medicine}} of Nada's eyes, he would not turn from his way, and was ever at her side, thinking of little else except of her. Thus, when Zinita came to him, and asked leave to declare a feast of women that should be held far away, he consented, and gladly, for, <b>above</b> <b>all</b> things, he desired {{to be free from}} Zinita and her angry looks for awhile; nor did <b>he</b> <b>suspect</b> a plot. Only he told her that Nada should not go to the feast; and in a breath both Zinita and Nada answered that his word was their will, as indeed it was, in this matter.|$|R

60|$|Biddy {{added in}} reply to a further {{question}} that {{what her mother}} was disappointed about was--well, themselves, her children and all their affairs; and she explained that Lady Agnes wanted {{all kinds of things}} for them that didn't come, that they didn't get or seem likely to get, so that their life appeared altogether a failure. She wanted a great deal, Biddy admitted; she really wanted everything, for she had thought in her happier days that everything was to be hers. She loved them all so much and was so proud too: she couldn't get over the thought of their not being successful. Peter was unwilling to press at this point, for <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> one of the things Lady Agnes wanted; but Biddy relieved him a little by describing her as eager <b>above</b> <b>all</b> that Grace should get married.|$|R
