50|$|In 1974, Donald J. Atwood, Jr., was {{appointed}} General Manager. The division was transformed {{in the following}} years as it grew {{to meet the needs}} of General Motors for engine and powertrain control modules to meet the U.S. government's strict 1981 Clean Air Act and other improved vehicle safety items including anti-skid brake system controllers and <b>inflatable</b> <b>restraint</b> (airbag) systems.|$|E
50|$|AmSafe Inc. is a {{manufacturer}} of air safety and securement products to the aerospace, defense, and ground transportation industries and maker of aircraft seatbelts. AmSafe makes the Aviation <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Restraint</b> (AAIR), a seatbelt airbag approved by the FAA designed to improve occupant protection from serious head injury during an otherwise unsurvivable aircraft accident. The airbag allows manufacturers and airlines to meet the FAA 16g seat retrofit rule that mandates all aircraft comply by October 2009 (1).|$|E
40|$|Typical {{automotive}} airbag {{systems have}} a fixed area vent for exiting gasses. The US Army Cockpit Airbag System (CABS) is unvented {{to prolong the}} period during which the system can provide occupant protection during extended helicopter crash scenarios. In each application, system performance may be enhanced by providing a controlled vent area. This paper describes work conducted under a Phase I SBIR program sponsored by the NASA Langley Research Center. The work was focused on eventual <b>inflatable</b> <b>restraint</b> system applications in general aviation aircraft, and showed that appropriate vent control offers many enhancements. Two series of tests conducted during Phase I showed that <b>inflatable</b> <b>restraint</b> system size and weight can be reduced without degrading performance, injury potential in an out of position situation (OOPS) deployment can be reduced, and peak bag pressures can be reduced (at any temperature) during normal operation...|$|E
50|$|The auto {{industry}} {{and research and}} regulatory communities have moved away from their initial view of the airbag as a seat belt replacement, and the bags are now nominally designated as Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) or Supplemental <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Restraints.</b>|$|R
40|$|A computer-implemented {{method is}} {{provided}} for designing a restraint layer of an <b>inflatable</b> vessel. The <b>restraint</b> layer is <b>inflatable</b> from an initial uninflated configuration to an inflated configuration and is constructed from {{a plurality of}} interfacing longitudinal straps and hoop straps. The method involves providing computer processing means (e. g., to receive user inputs, perform calculations, and output results) and utilizing this computer processing means to implement a plurality of subsequent design steps. The computer processing means is utilized to input the load requirements of the inflated restraint layer and to specify an inflated configuration of the restraint layer. This includes specifying a desired design gap between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps, whereby the adjacent straps interface with a plurality of transversely extending hoop or longitudinal straps at a plurality of intersections. Furthermore, an initial uninflated configuration of the restraint layer that is inflatable to achieve the specified inflated configuration is determined. This includes calculating a manufacturing gap between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps that correspond to the specified desired gap in the inflated configuration of the restraint layer...|$|R

USE - For use as solid propellants for reaction propulsion {{devices such as}} rockets, strategic weapon systems or tubular weapons, as explosives or in gas-generators used in (i) <b>inflatable</b> <b>restraint</b> or rescue systems such as airbags, (ii) high-pressure (e. g metal sheet) molding or forming or (iii) release of active media (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The release of allergenic copper aerosols associated with the compositions of DE 4442037 is avoided, as is also {{the high cost of}} production of such copper salts...|$|E
40|$|Advanced crash {{impact and}} {{emergency}} egress concepts, equipment, and techniques which have application to crew and passenger life support and crash safety in Air Force high-wing and low-wing air transport aircraft have been evaluated. An analysis of Air Force C- 1 3 5 and C- 1 4 1 ircraft accidents was made. Seventy-four state-of-the-art concepts nd {{systems have been}} analyzed from a systems engineering viewpoint. comprehensive evaluation of the airbag <b>inflatable</b> <b>restraint</b> system nd smoke-hood concepts was conducted, with additional investigation f developments relating to aisle and evacuation path markers and illumination; passenger warning and public address systems; passive restraint systems; egress including slides, slide/rafts, and telescape ystems exit area ablative coatings; emergency inflight egress concepts, nd high-energy emergency egress systems. It was concluded that use of resent rear-facing seat systems in Air Force transport aircraft offers ore reliable impact protection than does {{the current state of}} the ar...|$|E
