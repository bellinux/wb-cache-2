5|$|The Guadeloupe amazon or Guadeloupe parrot (Amazona violacea) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of parrot that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean <b>island</b> <b>region</b> of Guadeloupe. Mentioned and described by 17th and 18th century writers, it received a scientific name in 1789. It was moved to the genus Amazona in 1905, and {{is thought to have}} been related to, or possibly the same as, the extant imperial amazon. A tibiotarsus and an ulna bone from the island of Marie-Galante may belong to the Guadeloupe amazon. In 1905, a species of extinct violet macaw was also claimed to have lived on Guadeloupe, but in 2015 it was suggested to have been based on a description of the Guadeloupe amazon.|$|E
5|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean <b>island</b> <b>region</b> of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{producers}} of sugar in the world. At least 17 provinces located in eight regions of the nation have grown sugarcane crops, of which the Negros <b>Island</b> <b>Region</b> accounts for half of the country’s total production. As of Crop Year 2012-2013, 29 mills are operational divided as follows: 13 mills in Negros, 6 mills in Luzon, 4 mills in Panay, 3 mills in Eastern Visayas and 3 mills in Mindanao. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros <b>Island</b> <b>Region,</b> which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07% and Eastern Visayas by 04%.|$|E

At least 20-24 people were {{believed to have been}} exposed to AZAs in this event, but only eight sought medical attention. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 2–5 days prior to full recovery. Analysis of the shellfish revealed five AZA analogues, AZA1-5, with most of the toxin concentrated in the digestive glands at levels exceeding 30 μg/g (estimated at 6 μg/g whole mussel meat). The AZAs persisted in the mussels at elevated levels for at least eight months.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the terrain}} differences, the climates of sub-regions differ. The border area of the Móng Cái District is colder and rainy, with an average {{temperature}} of around 22°C and rainfall reaching 2,751mm. In the Yên Hưng District, the most southern area, the average temperature is 24°C and gets an average rainfall of 1,700mm. The high mountainous region of Hoành Bồ, and Ba Chẽ districts, has 20 days of frost a year, and is subject to little rainfall. In the Bình Liêu District there is heavy rain (2,400mm) and winter lasts for six months. The offshore <b>island</b> <b>region</b> is not the wettest area, with only 1,700 to 1,800mm of rainfall per year, but winter is often accompanied by thick mists.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, the Iraqi Army {{launched}} an offensive on the Khalidiya Island area, {{which is the}} region located between the villages Albu Nasir and Albu Shajal, situated between Ramadi and Fallujah.

On February 2, the Iraqi Army fully severed the last supply lines between the Khalidiya <b>Island</b> <b>region</b> {{and the city of}} Fallujah, completely besieging the city.

Although beaver were trapped to {{extinction}} on the island, two pairs of beaver that were released in 1920 by George B. Dorr at the brook between Bubble Pond and Eagle Lake have repopulated it. A large fire in 1947 cleared {{the eastern half of}} the island of its coniferous trees and permitted the growth of aspen, birch, alder, maple and other deciduous trees which enabled the beaver to thrive.|$|E
