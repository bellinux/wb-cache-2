Reduction of abundant ROS in the cigarette mainstream smoke (MSS) is of importance for human health. In this work, a simple, rapid, and reliable fluorescence evaluation of scavenging efficiency of antioxidants as potential filter additives against ROS in cigarette smoke is reported.

The antioxidant was added into a <b>glass</b> <b>reactor</b> attached to cigarette filter, which simplified the preparation of combined filter containing additives.

An ideal microfluidic device should combine easy immobilization and retention of a minimal amount of biocatalyst with a well-mixed reaction volume.

40|$|In this research, {{the high}} carbon-containing (coke,> 20 wt%) Pt {{catalyst}} wasted from a full-scale petrochemical plant are regenerated in quartz and borax glass reactors by applying 250 W microwave irradiation for 18 hours. When irradiated with microwave substances of various dielectric characteristics will consume the microwave energy; {{the quantity of}} energy consumed is proportional to dielectric constant. Because borax glass has higher dielectric constant than quartz glass (e. g. 4. 6 vs. 3. 6 F/M), it causes higher energy loss than quartz glass. Laboratory results reveal that the removal of coke is smaller for the sample placed in the borax <b>glass</b> <b>reactor</b> than in the quartz glass container (17. 7 vs. 25. 9 %). On the other hand, higher MW output power leads to stronger electrical field to influence the mutual reactions between microwave and dielectric materials (e. g. the absorption of microwave energy), and the overall energy efficiency.
