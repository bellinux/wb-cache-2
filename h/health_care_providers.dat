40|$|Background: The main aim of China’s <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> System Reform was to {{help the}} {{decision}} maker find the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection. A pilot <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> research system was recently organized in China’s <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, and it could efficiently collect the data for determining the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection from various experts, then {{the purpose of this}} study was to apply the optimal implementation methodology to help the decision maker effectively promote various experts’ views into various optimal solutions to this problem under the support of this pilot system. Methods: After the general framework of China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection was established, this study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics of China to commission a large-scale 2009 to 2010 national expert survey (n = 3, 914) through the organization of a pilot <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> research system for the first time in China, and the analytic network process (ANP) implementation methodology was adopted to analyze the dataset from this survey. Results: The market-oriented <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection from the doctors’ point of view; the traditional government’s regulation-oriented <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection from the pharmacists’ point of view, the hospital administrators’ point of view, and the point of view of health officials in health administration departments; the public private partnership (PPP) approach was the optimal solution to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection from the nurses’ point of view, the point of view of officials in medical insurance agencies, and the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> researchers’ point of view. Conclusions: The data collected through a pilot <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> research system in the 2009 to 2010 national expert survey could help the decision maker effectively promote various experts’ views into various optimal solutions to China’s institutional problem of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> selection...|$|R

5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

In 2008, she became {{chairwoman}} of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders and enact term limits for various boards and commissions. She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.|$|E

25|$|Expanded newborn {{screening}} is also opposed by among some <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers,</b> {{who are concerned}} that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, that false positive screening tests may cause harm, and issues of informed consent.
