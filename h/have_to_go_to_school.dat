The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E
500|$|Rick Rubin had {{produced}} their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers {{decided to look}} for other producers for Californication. David Bowie had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for Californication. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Recording took place at Cello Studios in Los Angeles. In early 1999, following the recording process, the band played [...] "Scar Tissue", [...] "Otherside", and [...] "Californication" [...] to their managers, and {{it was decided that}} [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] would be the lead single for the album. To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country to promote Californication. It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on [...] "how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show." ...|$|E

Ala Khatib, a co-principal, said that [...] "Never mind {{what is going}} on outside, whether it's bombing in Gaza or if it's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, you can't stop school. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> you have to face the other side, you have to say good morning, and you have to talk." ...|$|E

'Perhaps twice the money.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Maren {{said that}} due to {{previous}} engagements, the {{three members of the}} Lollipop guild did not stay in contact after Oz. In 2013 he stated [...] "We pretty much separated because they all had previous engagements.

2500|$|Beaver and Wally both attend {{public schools}} and are {{encouraged}} to pursue college educations {{as a means to}} prepare for their futures. Ward and June attended prep school and boarding school, respectively, and both attended college; their sons are expected to do the same. While both boys consider prep-school educations – Wally at the Bellport Military Academy and Beaver at an eastern school called Fallbrook – both remain at home and attend Mayfield High with their friends. School and homework are the bane of Beaver's existence. In [...] "Beaver's Secret Life", the boy decides to become a writer in adulthood because [...] "you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> or know nothing ... You only have to make up adventures and get paid for it." [...] Beaver's attitude toward education provides comic counterpoint to the backgrounds, values and ambitions of his parents.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, {{shortly before}} the end of his first year at the [...] in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he {{momentarily}} lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly.) A thought then came to him—"now you won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> anymore." [...] From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home {{for the next six months}} until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, [...] "was when I learned what a neurosis is." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Spotty Powder" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} as a short story in 1973. In 2005, The Times reprinted [...] "Spotty Powder" [...] as a [...] "lost" [...] chapter, saying it {{had been found in}} Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the way Leonardo da Vinci wrote his journal). This chapter describes Spotty Powder, which looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs Piker interpreted as screams. Mr Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) it was only laughter. Exactly what happened to them is not revealed in the extract.|$|E

60|$|I {{have known}} boys {{who thought that}} it would be {{perfectly}} delightful to be shipwrecked. They felt certain that they would be cast (very gently, no doubt) upon a desert island, and there they would find everything that they needed to support life and make them comfortable; and what they did not get there they would obtain from the wreck of the ship, which would be lying on the rocks, at a convenient distance from the shore. And once on that island, they would be their own masters, and would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> or do anything which did not please them.|$|E
