But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E

Unsatisfied with his physical conditioning, he began attending a gym as an 11-year-old. Despite this, Colón has stated {{that he did not}} intend to become a wrestler at first and only did so for exercise. It was not until completing his college education that he decided to train, after noticing that his condition was on par with the wrestlers despite his age. However, despite this Colón initially expected to retire within ten years and run a private business. He admits that during this initial stage, he received peer pressure to match the accomplishments of his father. Colón's decision to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment was a controversial one among the Puerto Rican wrestling community. He was criticized by the locals, labeled as someone who had [...] "sold out" [...] his Puerto Rican wrestling traditions over for the [...] "flash and flair" [...] of the American company.

After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised that if I did not escape while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E

In 1991, Marquez published Changing the History of Africa an admiring study of Cuban {{activities in the}} Angolan Civil War and the larger South African Border War. Marquez maintained a close but [...] "nuanced" [...] friendship with Fidel Castro, praising {{the achievements of the}} Cuban Revolution, but criticizing aspects of governance and working to [...] "soften (the) roughest edges" [...] of the country. García Márquez's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather's stories. In an interview, García Márquez told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, [...] "my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal. My political ideas probably came from him to begin with because, instead of telling me fairy tales when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war that free-thinkers and anti-clerics waged against the Conservative government." [...] This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that [...] "in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo, García Márquez's socialist and anti-imperialist views are in principled opposition to the global status quo dominated by the United States." ...|$|E

To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its [...] "spirit of intolerant prejudice", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to Haiti, by that time free black republic. [...] His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the slaves to his plantation in San Jose, now a neighborhood in Jacksonville. Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants; slavery was not allowed in Haiti. [...] They were to earn their freedom in nine years. In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to the abolitionist Lydia Child. When she asked him if he was aware that his occupation as a slave trader might be perceived as being akin to piracy, he responded [...] "Yes; and I am glad of it. They will look upon a slaveholder just so, by and by. Slave trading was a very respectable business when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young.</b> The first merchants in England and America were engaged in it.

500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying {{to find out}} if there is something common between two people" [...] and as a [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of the}} law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Smith, Sartorias-deles most resembles New Zealand. Smith's stories set in {{the world}} of Sartorias-deles have [...] "focuse a {{generation}} of kids with remarkable abilities who are born into extraordinary times." [...] Meliara ("Mel") is the protagonist of Crown Duel, which is {{set in the}} fictional country of Remalna. Remalna's human population lives alongside the mysterious Hill Folk, sentient beings that reside in the land's forests and with whom Mel has a special affinity. [...] Smith wrote the first part as a twenty-year-old, and sought to keep it set in Mel's teenage point of view when typing it out as someone older than forty. Smith describes the stories' primary audience as [...] "middle grade or YA, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> and writing from the kid's eye view." [...] At the same time, she made some changes to the original story based on her experience, such as providing motivations for the adult characters and [...] "nail down place and time more thoroughly than I did." [...] When Smith learned as a teenager that [...] "anyone could write a book," [...] she tried to write stories that would please potential publishers, as she assumed that they would never approve of [...] "real stuff" [...] like Crown Duel. Several decades before Crown Duels release, Smith [...] "began the laborious process of consolidating" [...] her notes on Sartorias-deles. As part of her development of the novel, she drew inspiration from European history; for example, details like the novel's fan language and changing fashions were inspired by the fashions at the Palace of Versailles court of Louis XIV of France.|$|E
