25|$|BBSes were {{generally}} text-based, rather than GUI-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> However, some home computer manufacturers <b>extended</b> the ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set</b> {{to take advantage}} of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native <b>character</b> <b>set</b> was known as ATASCII, while most Commodore BBSes supported PETSCII. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service Quantum Link.|$|R

50|$|APLX is a {{cross-platform}} dialect of the APL programming language. APLX {{is targeted}} at {{applications such as}} financial planning, market research, statistics, management information, and various kinds of scientific and engineering work. APLX is based on IBM's APL2, but includes a number of extensions. APLX is created by MicroAPL. Version 3 of APLX was released in April and May 2005. It is available on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. Though APLX keeps APL's <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> APLX {{is a bit more}} verbose, due to the prevalence of system functions with long names and the use of structured-control keywords. The use of explicit loops is a major deviation from earlier versions of APL, as well as other APL derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|The Sorcerer was a {{combination}} of parts from a standard S-100 bus machine and its custom display circuitry. The machine included the Zilog Z80 and various bus features needed to run the CP/M operating system, but placed them inside a [...] "closed" [...] box with a built-in keyboard similar to machines like the Commodore PET, the Commodore 64, and the Atari 8-bit family. Unlike those machines, the Sorcerer's keyboard was a high quality unit with full [...] "throw". The keyboard included a custom [...] "Graphics" [...] key, which allowed easy entry of the <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> without having to overwork the Control key, the more common solution on other machines. Leading its peers, the Sorcerer included lower-case characters as a standard feature.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} of its decommissioning, the {{computer}} was all solid-state, using a combination ofRTL, DTL and TTL. It had an array multiplier, 15 index registers, 16K of 6 microsecond cycle time core memory, and 64K of 2 microsecond cycle time core memory. A NOP instruction took about 2.5 microseconds. A Multiply took 8 microseconds, and a divide 25 microseconds. It had a paging unit using 1K word pages with an associative 16-deep lookup memory. A 1 Megaword CDC drum was hooked up as a paging device. It also had several ADDS Special-Order Direct-View Storage-Tube terminals. These terminals used an <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> which covered about all the mathematical symbols, and allowed for 1/2 line spacing for math formulas. For I/O, it had two IBM 360 series nine-track and two seven-track 1/2" [...] tape drives. It had an eight-bit paper-tape reader and punch, and a 500 line-per-minute printer (1500 line-per-minute using the hexadecimal character set). Storage was three IBM 7000 series 1301 disk drives, each having two modules of 21.6 million characters apiece.|$|E
