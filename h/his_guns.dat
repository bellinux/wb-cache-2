5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his command bunker, so {{even though he was}} able to get two of <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> until that position was neutralised.|$|E

5|$|Voss scored rapidly during February and March 1917; of the 15 {{victories}} {{credited to}} his jasta (squadron) during March, 11 fell under <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> For his feats, {{he was awarded}} the Knight's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern on 17 March. The following day, Voss downed two British aircraft in ten minutes. The first one burned; the second aircrew downed protested they had been strafed by Voss after crashlanding within German lines.|$|E
5000|$|One morning, {{outside the}} fort's stockade, William Hardin test fired <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> {{preparing}} {{to go out}} for a hunt. While Hardin was wiping <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> out, a Kentucky aborigine came out from his hiding spot, with <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> aiming at William Hardin. The Aborigine tauntingly exclaimed: [...] "Ugh! Big Bill." [...] The pause was fatal to the Native American for William Hardin immediately knocked <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> aside, and with <b>his</b> own <b>gun,</b> clubbed out the Indian's brains.|$|R

5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored {{his first}} victory as an {{official}} member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.|$|E

Victor and Beatrice travel home on a subway and share a kiss.|$|R
60|$|Then as Coffee furiously jammed {{his hand}} back for <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> Neale struck him. Coffee fell with the {{overturned}} table out in the sand. <b>His</b> <b>gun</b> dropped as he dropped. Neale was there light and quick. He snatched up the gun.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, John Considine drew <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> on Meredith, who {{was clearly}} wounded, but still moving and {{possibly}} reaching for another weapon. Considine shot Meredith {{three times in}} the chest and neck, killing him, then handed <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> to Sheriff Cudihee and surrendered himself.|$|R
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|Xigbar's {{telescopic}} sight was {{changed from a}} crosshair and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine <b>his</b> <b>guns,</b> but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{accompanied}} the First Corps to northern Georgia {{in the fall}} of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle, but served as Longstreet's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He returned with the corps to Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able to move <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> quickly through the lines, emplacing them to repel the main attack.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{according}} to the accounts of Ms. Luling Casimiro, one of the seamstresses of the image, a Japanese soldier arrogantly aimed <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> at the statue, but scampered away in fright after the magazine of <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> melted and bent right before his very eyes.|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit and Sammy Jay stopped quarreling to look. Sure enough, {{there was}} Farmer Brown's boy with <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b> He had heard Blacky the Crow and his aunts and his uncles and his cousins {{and he had}} hurried to get <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> hoping to take them by surprise.|$|R
50|$|The short {{features}} Krazy Kat {{hunting for}} turkey. He shoots with <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> {{what he thinks}} is turkey, but turns out to be an Indian instead. The Indian chases Krazy Kat and gets caught. An anamorphic pole ties Krazy up, and the Indians light a fire below him. Krazy manages to escape from the Indians, but then the Indians start shooting arrows at him. Krazy finds <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> and uses it as a record player, and the Indians start dancing. A female Indian wants to kiss Krazy, but he hits her with <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> instead. All of the Indians get angry and try to get Krazy, but Krazy escapes from the crowd, dismantles <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> and uses the Indians (now huddled in a circle, not realizing Krazy had escaped) as a record player.|$|R
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E
5|$|In the RAF, Marcinkus {{carried out}} {{multiple}} tasks, including various training missions, night combat and bomber escort. In June, Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged in prolonged air combat with the Luftwaffe. As later reports confirm, the Germans lost four Me 109 fighter aircraft, {{one of which}} was shot down by Marcinkus. The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in The National Archives; he states that he fired two short bursts from <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> from 100 yards behind the German. Sergeant Blasil, also of 1 Squadron, witnessed the plane break up in the air. On the allied side, one American pilot was missing. The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF pilot was on 12 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him from the opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E

5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before carrying it out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried a hidden Cylon program would activate and make him turn against the fleet. <b>His</b> <b>guns</b> are unresponsive while targeting a Raider. As Anders and the Raider come face-to-face, the Raider scans Anders, and in doing so, Anders' iris momentarily glows red. In response to this, the Raider flips direction and it, {{along with all the}} other Raiders, immediately stop the attack and retreat to their basestar and jump away, much to the surprise of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> in the 150-minute chase.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E

5|$|By mid-June, III./JG52 {{was back}} {{together}} in Bucharest and re-equipped with the new, more powerful Bf109F-4 model. The Gruppe {{was not involved}} in most of the fighting in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa as it was once again kept back to defend Ploiești and the Romanian ports from Soviet bombers. The pilots’ mood was not helped when Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, criticised the unit on 4 July for its lack of success compared to virtually all the other Jagdgruppen. On 1 August, after German advances had removed the threat of Soviet air attacks on Romania, the unit was transferred to the front line and the major Luftwaffe airbase at Belaya Zerkov in the Ukraine south of Kiev. Graf achieved his first victory {{in the early hours of}} 4 August when his squadron was escorting a Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombing strike, shooting down one of a pair of attacking Polikarpov I-16 fighters. Despite his success, he was reprimanded by his squadron leader, because he had broken formation and forgotten to arm <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> before firing. His second victory was achieved the next day, although Graf was lucky to get away unscathed – landing his aircraft riddled with bullet holes.|$|E
5|$|Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had {{acquired}} {{some of the}} first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and saw first-hand their effective use as his 15-man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanche in Texas. Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican-American War, and traveled to New York City in search of Colt. He met Colt in a gunsmith's shop on January 4, 1847, and placed an order for 1,000 revolvers. Walker asked for a few changes; the new revolvers would have to hold 6 shots instead of 5, have enough power to kill either a man or a horse with a single shot and be quicker to reload. The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business. Colt hired Eli Whitney Blake, who was established in the arms business, to make <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> Colt used his prototype and Walker's improvements as the basis for a new design. From this new design, Blake produced the first thousand-piece order known as the Colt Walker. The company then received an order for a thousand more; Colt took a share of the profits at $10 per pistol for both orders.|$|E
5|$|He {{estimated}} the various Maratha powers totals to 81,000 infantry, 106,000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns. Of these the Peshwa {{had the highest}} number of cavalry at 28,000, along with 14,000 infantry and 37 guns. The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune, which was the southernmost location amongst the other Maratha powers. Holkar had the second largest cavalry, amounting to 20,000, and an infantry force of 8,000. <b>His</b> <b>guns</b> totaled to 107 guns. Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry, with each having 15,000 and 16,000 cavalry, respectively. Shinde had 16,000 infantry and Bhonsle, 18,000. Shinde had the larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas Bhonsle had 85. Holkar, Shinde and Bhonsle were headquartered in Indore, Gwalior and Nagpur respectively. The Afghan leader Amir Khan was located in Tonk in Rajputana and his strength was 12,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and 200 guns. The Pindaris were located north of the Narmada valley in Chambal and Malwa region of central India. Three Pindari leaders sided with Shinde, these were Setu, Karim Khan and Dost Mohammad. They were mostly horsemen with strengths of 10,000, 6,000 and 4,000. The rest of the Pindari chiefs, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu and Bapu were allied with Holkar. Tulsi and Imam Baksh each had 2,000 horsemen, Kadir Baksh, 21,500. Sahib Khan, Nathu and Bapu had 1,000, 750 and 150 horsemen.|$|E
