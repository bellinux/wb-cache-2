5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L.

He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E

These authors examined 36 taxa of the 65 listed then, and a later extended analysis by Rønsted et al. (2008) with five additional taxa confirmed this pattern.|$|E

USB <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|E
