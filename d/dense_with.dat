Starting with Kunimitsu, the kissaki becomes larger. The jihada is small-grain mokume-hada, <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei.

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, <b>dense,</b> <b>with</b> long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E

5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Alberta in 1902, {{but it did}} not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when reserves of it were discovered near Leduc. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing oil boom. The city's economy grew when oil prices increased with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973. The population increased by 272,000 in the eighteen years between 1971 (403,000) and 1989 (675,000) and another 345,000 in the next eighteen years (to 1,020,000 in 2007). During these boom years, skyscrapers were constructed and the relatively low-rise downtown quickly became <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> tall buildings.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{in terms}} of {{population}} clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas.

There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The coat is {{very thick}} and <b>dense,</b> <b>with</b> a soft {{undercoat}} and stiff, coarse guard hairs. The Eskimo Dog has a mane of thick fur around its neck, {{which is quite}} impressive in the males and adds an illusion of additional size. This mane is smaller in females. Eskimo Dogs can be almost any colour, and no one colour or colour pattern should dominate. Solid white dogs are often seen, as well as white dogs with patches of another colour on the head or both body and head. Solid silver or black coloured dogs are common as well. Many of the solid coloured dogs have white mask-like markings on the face, sometimes with spots over the eyes. Others might have white socks and nose stripes with no eye spots or mask.|$|E

25|$|On {{hearing of}} the Paris results, neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge were {{convinced}} by the gamma ray hypothesis. Assisted by Norman Feather, Chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis was untenable. He repeated {{the creation of the}} radiation using beryllium, used better approaches to detection, and aimed the radiation at paraffin following the Paris experiment. Paraffin is high in hydrogen content, hence offers a target <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> protons; since neutrons and protons have almost equal mass, protons scatter energetically from neutrons. Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton; these particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the unusual}} street grid that already existed {{in much of}} Greenwich Village, the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 would not quite fit into the {{pre-existing}} street grid. This resulted in several blocks with oblique angles, {{as well as many}} triangular street blocks. The former farms of Christopher Street were split into small lots from 1789 to 1829. After a subsequent large population increase in the early 19th century, the buildings on Christopher Street were <b>dense</b> <b>with</b> people. In 1835, the Great Fire of New York spread through the area and destroyed many city blocks. The little triangle of land bounded by Christopher, Grove, and 4th Streets, which was burned down, was condemned and turned into a park. The new Christopher Street Park, designed by architects Calvert Vaux and Samuel Parsons, Jr., was opened in 1837. The Stonewall Inn, which then consisted simply of two adjacent stables, opened across Christopher Street in 1843.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} more single-planet systems in Aquarius. HD 210277, a {{magnitude}} 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: HD 210277 b. The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at {{nearly the same}} distance as Earth orbits the Sun1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days. HD 210277 b was discovered earlier {{than most of the}} other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998. The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar spectral class; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses. HD 212771 b, a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star HD 212771 at a distance of 1.22 AU. The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth.

40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} of a <b>dense</b> plasma <b>with</b> short laser pulses (ns) is investigated. The dense plasma is created using a low-current hollow-cathode-triggered discharge. This configuration generates a <b>dense</b> plasma <b>with</b> an electron density of ne 1017 cm 3. Spectra are {{taken in the}} extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral range from 11 - 18 nm to estimate the temperature. The interaction between plasma and laser beam as a longitudinally pumped light source is discussed. The required properties of the plasma, according to the radial profiles of the temperature and the density, are exemplified. It is shown, that the generation of double pulses in the extrem ultraviolet spectral range is possible by reheating the residuals of an expanding <b>dense</b> plasma <b>with</b> a short laser pulse...|$|R
