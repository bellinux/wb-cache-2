500|$|Despite its {{relative}} antiquity by 1970, the song's lyrics lent themselves {{well to the}} themes of spiritual salvation and friendship that define All Things Must Pass, being consistent with the karmic subject matter {{of much of the}} album. In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison explains: [...] "'Isn't It a Pity' is about whenever a relationship hits a down point... It was a chance to realise that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> somebody had let me down, then there's a good chance I was letting someone else down." [...] His lyrics adopt a nonjudgmental tone throughout: ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{behind the}} camera, a {{prisoner}} asked Speck {{if he had}} killed the nurses. [...] Speck responded, [...] "Sure I did." [...] When asked why, Speck shrugged and jokingly said, [...] "It just wasn't their night." [...] Asked {{how he felt about}} himself in the years since, he said, [...] "Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you're asking me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry, no." [...] He also described in detail the experience of strangling someone: [...] "It's not like TV ... it takes over three minutes {{and you have to have}} a lot of strength." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{struggled}} to my knees, and <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> terrified {{in my life}} it was then, and I am not ashamed to say that I hesitated and hung back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{have put}} up a more {{vigorous}} protest against troubling Mrs. Acton than <b>I</b> did, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{it would have been}} of any use," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{less like}} a walking brandy-bottle I shouldn't be quite so staggery this mornin',' replied Sam. 'Are you stoppin' in this house, old 'un?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt {{strongly}} on the subject, I {{tried to look}} as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> strongly too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! that's the question. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I {{was talking}} to a real Christian that had a care for the poor girl's soul, I would tell you in a moment." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{twisted his}} chair around toward the stove. It was useless to dispute the {{question}} with him, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> inclined to do so. He absorbed {{himself in his}} stew-pan.|$|R
6000|$|Jos. [...] I know it, [...] But cannot {{think of}} sorrow now, and doubt [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> e'er <b>felt</b> it, 'tis so dazzled from [...] My memory by this {{oblivious}} transport!-- [...] My son! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mary, dear, don't let Mite come in. I {{am afraid}} {{it is too}} late to keep you away, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> like this yesterday, I would have gone {{straight}} to the fever hospital.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what you}} say is as natural to me as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it," [...] said Dale. [...] "I wondered. You're {{certainly}} full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So much I learnt {{concerning}} old Isaac. And when in {{the afternoon}} he toddled away, {{and back into the}} forest, what wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like Wordsworth after his talk with the old leech-gatherer?-- ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. Morning! [In {{answer to}} an {{appealing}} gesture from COKESON] I'm sorry; I'd stop short of this <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I could. Open that door. [SWEEDLE, wondering and scared, opens it] Come here, Mr. Falder.|$|E
60|$|I FIND it {{impossible}} to describe my sensations while the carriage was taking me to Major Fitz-David's house. <b>I</b> doubt, indeed, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> or thought at all, in the true sense of those words.|$|R
60|$|I {{was very}} much frightened, and said, <b>I</b> hoped so, <b>if</b> he pleased. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> all this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Lucille," [...] he murmured, [...] "how {{could you}} ever doubt it? There was a day, I admit, {{when the sun}} stood still, when, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{inclined}} to turn to light literature, I should have read aloud the Book of Job. But afterwards--well, you see that I am here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} if I told you the {{circumstances}} you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that {{you were at the}} back of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Sahib, {{it is not}} that; I would go, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure I {{should be}} found out and cut to pieces. Anything {{would be better than}} this. I am not afraid at all.|$|E
6000|$|At night, when I {{had gone}} to bed, Joe came into my room, {{as he had done}} all through my recovery. He asked me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure that I was {{as well as in the}} morning? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not; and I {{would not}} have {{accepted}} him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not <b>felt</b> sure of you, Giles, my boy; so come along and let's have something to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ingleby. [...] "That is it exactly. Of course, I know I'm {{taking an}} unwarranted liberty, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> that Hetty {{could have had}} any liking for him I should not have {{mentioned}} it to you. Still, don't you {{think it might be}} better if she didn't see so much of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{could have}} been drowned," [...] said I, [...] "for I should have dropped the old thing, and floated, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> myself giving out. But the good of it was this: It showed me what a disagreeable sort of place a sea-garden is, when you go down into it to pick things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} undeserving of the {{confidence}} you have honoured me with, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long as {{you will}} come," [...] he replied, confidently, [...] "we will see about the rest. Do you know, Sara, it would almost spoil {{everything}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that this change in my life were to disturb--our friendship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I rather {{thought of}} tottering {{out for a}} bite of lunch later on, and then {{possibly}} staggering round to the club, and after that, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> strong enough, I might trickle off to Walton Heath for a round of golf.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{answer is}} in mine own heart," [...] {{answered}} Ebbo. [...] "Since our stay at Ulm, <b>I</b> have ever <b>felt</b> {{as though the}} sweet motherling were less my own! And the same with my house and lands. Rule as I will, a mocking laugh comes back to me, saying: 'Thou art but a boy, Sir Baron, thou dost but play at lords and knights.' <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had hung yon rogue of a reiter, <b>I</b> wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> my grasp more real?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Adam {{shook his}} head. [...] "No troops," [...] he sighed. [...] "I told my Chief about it, {{and he said}} we must wait till they chopped a white man. He advised me <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like it not to commit a--a barren felo de se, but to let the Sheshaheli do it. Then he could report, and then we could mop 'em up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{she wrote}} to {{me to say that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>felt</b> myself hurt,' {{she looked down at her}} young mistress, 'or found myself worried,' she looked down at her again, 'I might go to her, and be considerately treated. I was to think of it, and could speak to her by the church. So I went there to thank her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd never hold my head {{up again}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I {{had been driven}} out. Besides, {{what is there to}} be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free country? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Maud with a smile, [...] "I wouldn't {{think of}} retreating <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that our services were really needed, {{but there are}} so many women coming here for Red Cross work--English, French, Swiss, Dutch and Italian--that they seem able to cover the field thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a sweet one, too," [...] said Dora, [...] "with {{a perfect}} {{right to go}} to sleep if she chooses. I should be ashamed of myself <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in the least degree offended. Do not let us disturb her until the doctor comes; the nap will do her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had you {{any idea}} of his coming so soon?" [...] said Mrs. Dashwood. [...] "I had none. On the contrary, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> any anxiety {{at all on the}} subject, it has been in recollecting that he {{sometimes}} showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know I was a fool, Stephen! I had {{my chance}} {{that day on}} the hilltop; and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> then as <b>I</b> feel now, as <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> every moment since, I {{would not have been}} so cold. I would have taken you in my arms and held you close and kissed you, again, and again, and again. Oh, darling! I love you! I love you! I love you!' He held out his arms imploringly. 'Won't you love me? Won't--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} told him so in an instant, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had made up my mind. Do you think I would wish {{to keep him in}} {{suspense}} on such a matter? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could have <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> could love him as his wife, I {{would have told}} him so instantly,--instantly." ...|$|R
