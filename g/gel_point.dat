Significant disparity is found between the prediction of the gelation theory {{and that of the}} percolation theory.

40|$|Gluing of {{wood with}} great {{moisture}} content has challenge of water interaction with glue to give unwanted changes in glue properties and formed bond-line. Rheological measurements of polyurethane glues are sufficiently effective method {{to understand the}} polymer curing process and viscoelastic properties. <b>Gel</b> formation <b>point</b> is important parameter for a glue {{from the point of}} its application. When glue reaches the <b>gel</b> formation <b>point,</b> its viscosity drastically increases so that it could not properly wet the wood and it can result in poor bonds. One-component moisture curing polyurethane glues require water molecules for the polyadditional reaction. When water is involved in the curing reaction, it reacts with the isocyanate groups of glue and can lead to the formation of excessive carbon dioxide and thus can lead to glue penetration out of bond-line, additional backpressure. The dynamic viscoelastic parameters such as complex dynamic viscosity (ή), phase angle (δ), elastic storage modulus (G”), the viscous loss modulus (G”) of two kinds of polyurethane glues depending on added water amount (from 0. 9 % to 10. 0 %) at a constant frequency and deformation (oscillation mode) were determined using rheometer.

50|$|An organogel is a {{class of}} gel {{composed}} of a liquid organic phase within a three-dimensional, cross-linked network. Organogel networks can form in two ways. The first is classic gel network formation via polymerization. This mechanism converts a precursor solution of monomers with various reactive sites into polymeric chains that grow into a single covalently-linked network. At a critical concentration (the <b>gel</b> <b>point),</b> the polymeric network becomes large enough so that on the macroscopic scale, the solution starts to exhibit gel-like physical properties: an extensive continuous solid network, no steady-state flow, and solid-like rheological properties. However, organogels that are “low molecular weight gelators” can also be designed to form gels via self-assembly. Secondary forces, such as van der Waals or hydrogen bonding, cause monomers to cluster into a non-covalently bonded network that retains organic solvent, and as the network grows, it exhibits gel-like physical properties. Both gelation mechanisms lead to gels characterized as organogels.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} {{thermosets}} (crosslinked polymers) {{is determined by}} a numerous {{factors such as the}} purity of the used monomer, polymerization time and temperature, stoichiometry of comonomers (when used) or type and quantity of catalyst or initiator. Another rarely minded factor is the volume shrinking (and density increase) during polymerization; actually all polymers are shrinking during polymerization to some degree. This volume shrinkage can lead (after the <b>gel</b> <b>point)</b> to mechanical stress within the polymer (internal stress), which may cause microfractures, worse mechanical properties or detaching form the substrate. Expandable monomers occupy after polymerization a greater volume than before and were designed to counteract the volumetric shrinkage upon addition. For other applications, like precision castings or dental fillings, a slight expansion during polymerization would be desirable for complete filling of a given mold. Nonetheless, for some applications even a small shrinkage can be desirable as for one-piece molds, to accomplish an easy removal. Expanding monomers are used to influence respectively control the volume change during the polymerization.|$|E

Hirst et al. showed that the solubility of the gelators in media can be modified by tuning the peripheral protecting groups of the gelators, which in turn controls the <b>gel</b> <b>point</b> and the concentrations at which crosslinking takes place (See Table 2 for data). Gelators that have higher solubility in medium show less preference for crosslinking. These gelators (Figure 1) are less effective and require higher total concentrations to initiate the process. In addition, solvent-molecule interactions also modulate the level of self-assembly. This was shown by Hirst et al. in the NMR binding model as well as in SAXS/SANS results.Garner et al. explored the importance of organogelator structures using 4-tertbutyl-1-aryl cy-clohexanol derivatives showing that a phenyl group in an axial configuration induces gelation, unlike derivatives with the phenyl group in equatorial configuration. Polymeric organogelators can induce gelation even at very low concentrations (less than 20 g/L) and the self-assembly capability could be customized by modifying the chemical structure of the polymer backbone.|$|E
