40|$|Plastics {{processes}} play {{an important}} and irreplaceable role in manufacturing industry {{as well as our}} daily lives. This paper focuses on the plastics forming processes with a focus on <b>moulding</b> processes. An overview of some basic plastics forming processes, their products and production capacities, is presented. These processes include extrusion, blow <b>moulding,</b> rotational <b>moulding,</b> compression <b>moulding,</b> transfer <b>moulding,</b> thermoforming and injection <b>moulding.</b> The future trend is envisaged with respect to the forming processes, machinery, <b>moulds</b> and materials. Also highlighted is the computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology being used by the industry. Some leading CAD/CAM packages are reviewed in light of their capabilities and applicability. The paper also lays an emphasis on the status of the New Zealand situation in the plastics forming industry. A survey showed that the New Zealand plastics industry involves over 400 enterprises, mostly small. The majority of them only operate a single <b>moulding</b> process, with injection <b>moulding</b> being the principal process.

40|$|Purpose: The casting-mould {{system is}} considered. Additionally, {{it is assumed}} that part of {{internal}} parameters determining the course of thermal processes, e. g. volumetric specific heat of <b>mould,</b> <b>mould</b> thermal conductivity, casting thermal conductivity and the like is unknown. Formulated in this way an inverse problem can be solved using different methods and in this paper the possibility of evolutionary algorithms application is presented. To solve the problem knowledge of cooling/heating curves at selected set of points from casting/mould domain is necessary. The evolutionary algorithm allows to minimize the fitness function containing the differences between the ‘measured’ cooling curves and the same curves found on the basis of boundary initial problem numerical solution for the assumed set of parameters. The calculated cooling/heating curves have been found using explicit scheme of finite difference method. It turned out that the algorithm proposed gives sufficiently exact results of identification and it can be successfully applied in the scope of thermal theory of foundry process. Design/methodology/approach: In this work numerical modelling of solidification process is applied. A cast iron solidifying in a sand <b>mould</b> is analyzed. The information concerning the courses of cooling/heating curves at the selected set of points from the domain considered is used in order to identify the unknown parameters of the process analyzed. Findings: Application of evolutionary algorithms gives sufficiently exact results of identification of solidification parameters. Research limitations/implications: Further work requires an introducing of real temperature measurements to the model presented. Practical implications: The paper shows the possibilities of solidification parameters identification on the basis of temperature measurements. Originality/value: The evolutionary algorithms presented allow to identify the parameters of solidification process e. g. volumetric specific heat of <b>mould,</b> <b>mould</b> thermal conductivity, casting thermal conductivity and the like...|$|R
