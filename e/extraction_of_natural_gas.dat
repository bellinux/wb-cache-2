50|$|Due to {{urbanization}} {{and modernization}} in Niigata City {{and the surrounding}} area, in order to extract water-soluble <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the ground water, water pumping quickly increased in 1950. As a result, land subsidence became a serious problem. Since 1959, thanks to restrictions on the <b>extractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and ground water in the Niigata city area, large scale land subsidence has lessened. However, in that period the ground was observed to settle an average of 20 cm a year. This land subsidence, the liquefaction in the inner city, and the tsunami all contributed to the massive inundation damage during the earthquake.|$|R

25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo {{to where it was}} used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2–3% could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|E

50|$|The Bolivian {{economy has}} had a {{historic}} pattern of a single-commodity focus. From silver to tin to coca, Bolivia has enjoyed only occasional periods of economic diversification. Political instability and difficult topography have constrained efforts to modernize the agricultural sector. Similarly, relatively low population growth coupled with low life expectancy and high incidence of disease has kept the labor supply in flux and prevented industries from flourishing. Rampant inflation and corruption also have thwarted development, {{but in recent years}} the fundamentals of its economy have showed unexpected improvement, leading major credit rating agencies to upgrade Bolivia's economic rating in 2010.

5000|$|Shale gas {{is present}} in the {{siliceous}} shales of all three members of the Horn River Formation in northeastern British Columbia, and it is produced in the Greater Sierra oil field north of Fort Nelson. Horizontal drilling and fracturing techniques are used to extract the gas from the low permeability shales.

[...] Companies involved in the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> from the Horn River Shale include EnCana, Apache, EOG, Stone Mountain Resources, Exxon, Quicksilver Resources, Nexen and Devon Energy. Horn River gas contains 10-12% CO2, much higher than the 2-4.5% of conventional natural gas.
