The life history features of these deep-water resources {{make them more}} vulnerable to exploitation than most shallow-water resources. Moreover, the apparent lack of solid information about the ecology of most deep-water species represents a major limitation for {{the development and implementation}} of management strategies. This scenario has caused great concern regarding the sustainability of these resources and the possible environmental impacts on the deep-sea ecosystem. In Latin America, commercial fisheries are going deep as well, and considering the above-mentioned concerns, we felt the need to compile the available information about the deep-water shrimp resources and the current status of their fisheries in Latin America. Focusing on Mexico, Central America, Peru, Chile and Brazil, this review describes the exploited species, and, whenever available, the fishing fleet, fishery statistics, and management strategies. A total of 17 species (10 spp. of Penaeoidea; 7 spp. of Caridea) are of commercial interest in Latin America, but <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimps</b> are currently fished only in Costa Rica, Colombia and Chile. An implemented management plan exists in Chile and Colombia, while Brazil approved fishery regulations for the aristeid fishery, which were never implemented. Considering the lack of information about the biology of the <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimps,</b> which hinders the development of adequate management strategies, we see the urgent need to improve the communication and collaboration between the different stakeholders in Latin American. We suggest the establishment of a searchable and constantly updated database, which may serve as a valuable source of information for researcher and decision makers.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The recent {{development}} of deep-water fisheries off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastern and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a gov-ernment-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnet-ters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), the Bra-zilian codling (Urophycis mystacea), the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), the Argentine short-fin squid (Illex argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimps</b> (family Aristeidae), heavily ex-ploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006.

40|$|Data on {{the size}} {{distribution}} and population biology of the deep-water shrimp Aristeus antennatus were collected during four trawl surveys carried out along the Italian coasts (exploited area) and off north-western Greece (unexploited area). Comparison between the sampled populationswas {{carried out in the}} 500 – 800 mdepth range where trawl fishing, targeting <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimps</b> (A. antennatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea), occurs only along the Italian coasts. Some explorative hauls were also made as deep as about 1200 m. A. antennatus was collected down to 1122 m in the Italian area and 1174 m in Greek waters. It was found to be more abundant in the former area than in the latter. In both areas, the sex ratio was largely in favour of females and changed with depth. Maturity process by size was found to be similar in the two areas. Even though the median carapace lengths computed for the Greek samples were significantly greater than those for the Italian ones, a wide size range with superimposed modal components was found {{on both sides of the}} Ionian Sea. The estimated growth performance was the same in the two areas. In the Greek sampled population, the total mortality rates generally coincided with the natural mortality rates. No significant differences in the total mortality rates were detected between the Italian and Greek stock. The application of the yield per recruit model to the exploited stock, according to different scenarios, indicated conditions close to optimal harvesting. These results are discussed considering all the features which reduce vulnerability to fishing and favour recovery of the A. antennatus stock, thus blunting the differences in the population structure between the exploited and unexploited areas. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Modeling the zero and nonzero values by two joint processes, as we propose in this work, allows to obtain great flexibility and easily handling of complex likelihood functions, avoiding inaccurate statistical inferences due to misclassification of the high proportion of exact zeros in the model. Bayesian model estimation is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, suitably specifying the complex likelihood function of the zero-inflated density data.

40|$|Marine {{invertebrates}} inhabiting {{the high}} Antarctic continental shelves are challenged by disturbance of the seafloor by grounded ice, low but stable water temperatures and variable food availability {{in response to}} seasonal sea-ice cover. Though a high diversity of life has successfully adapted to such conditions, it is generally agreed that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the large-scale cover of the Southern Ocean by multi-annual sea ice and the advance of the continental ice sheets across the shelf faced life with conditions, exceeding those seen today by an order of magnitude.

Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked.

Carapace length (CL) of the female and male <b>deep-water</b> rose <b>shrimp</b> in Terrasini ranged from 9 to 32 mm and 13 to 26 mm, respectively, whereas in Porticello the length ranged from 8 to 31 mm and 13 to 26 mm, respectively.

The shrimp was mainly found in the shallower zone (< 1000 m) of the eastern Ionian Sea. Few specimens {{were caught in the}} deeper waters of this region, with 1100 m being the lower limit of its distribution. This is the maximum depth reported for the species in the Mediterranean.

The recruitment seems to take place at the shallowest stations (600 m). More than 50 % of adult females were in advanced maturity stages. The striking abundance differences of the species between the western and eastern locations may be explained by the different exploitation level of the deep waters (almost null in the eastern Ionian Sea and extensive more westwards).

The shrimp, in particular the <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimp</b> Pandalus borealis, were known species, but were considered rare and not worth looking for. Around 1898, Hjort adapted earlier designs of deep-sea trawls on the soft bottoms of the deep Norwegian fjords and soon discovered enormous stocks of Pandalus borealis. This at first did not impress the fishermen. As H. G. Maurice, the 1920-1938 President of ICES, recalls, [...] "Hjort wasted no time in argument. He went prawn fishing, returned to harbour with a spectacular catch and dumped it on the quay. That was enough. With that practical demonstration he laid the foundation of an exceedingly profitable fishery and a flourishing export trade". Many years later, when travelling to Harvard in 1936 to collect an honorary degree, he predicted that the deep-sea shrimp would be found off the New England coast, since the ecological conditions were similar to those of the soft-bottomed Norwegian fjords. Taking time off to pursue his hypotheses, he was given command of the research ship Atlantis, and found vast amounts of shrimp exactly where he predicted they would be; this led to the formation of a shrimp fishery industry on the US side.|$|R

However, {{the current}} fisheries management system {{is incapable of}} achieving this objective. The most valuable fish stocks are over-exploited with excessive fishing effort and capacity and no sustainable resource rents are being produced. Policy reform has started with the design and implementation of a fishery management plan for the <b>deep-water</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. A participative process has proposed a new strategy and a revised institutional framework {{for the management of}} the fishery with a focus on the resource wealth (resource rents). A preliminary stage was to estimate rents using bioeconomic modelling so as to clarify the stakes and the need for reform and generate understanding and support amongst stakeholders. A central feature of the plan is the creation of a private Fishery Management Organisation (FMO) involving all the companies operating in the fishery. The allocation of collective exclusive fishing rights to this organisation is based on the historical catch performance of the fishing companies. A Public-Private Partnership is being established (as a concession) between the Government and the FMO. The concession establishes the rights and responsibilities of each party. The FMO is responsible for the operating cost of the future management system.

40|$|SUMMARY: With {{the aim of}} {{analyzing}} the trophic dynamics of deep-sea shrimp over the central Algerian slope, stomach contents of 219 individuals of Parapenaeus longirostris and 263 Aristeus antennatus were collected at night at depths between 200 and 400 m on a seasonal scale in 2007. Fullness (f), which {{is a measure of}} feeding intensity, showed significant seasonal changes in Aristeus antennatus, and the highest f was found in pre-reproductive periods (3. 3 % in January; 3. 0 % in April) before the beginning of gonad maturation (April-September in the area). This trend was coupled with the period of high surface productivity off the central Algerian coast (November-April). In that pre-reproductive period A. antennatus consumed more crustaceans (e. g. large decapods such as Processa sp.) with a high energetic value. These kinds of seasonal oscillations in f were not found in P. longirostris, probably because it was distributed shallower than A. antennatus and does not have a single marked peak in its reproductive cycle. The dietary composition of P. longirostris and A. antennatus was clearly segregated in the MDS analysis, which suggests there is good resource partitioning between the two species. Foraminiferans, bivalves and polychaetes were the most frequent prey in the diet of both P. longirostris and A. antennatus. Small micro and mesoplankton prey (radiolarians, tintinnids, copepods and pteropods) were more important in the diet of P. longirostris, while A. antennatus fed more on benthos. Planktonic prey found in the diet of the two shrimp were more frequent in January-February and April-May, e. g. in periods of higher water homogeneity coupled with periods of higher surface production.

Negative allometries were apparent in the carapace length-weight relationships in males of all species. Isometric relationships were found in females apart from in P. heterocarpus. The population patterns conform to relevant Mediterranean reports. However, some population differences exist that may reflect the distinct environmental conditions prevailing in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The <b>deep-water</b> rose <b>shrimp,</b> Parapenaeus longirostris, is a {{demersal}} species {{found in the}} Mediterranean and Atlantic Seas. The study area comprises three Spanish CGPM-FAO Geographic Sub-Areas (GSA’s) : Alboran Sea (GSA 1), the Balearic Islands (GSA 5) and Northern Spain (GSA 6). Data from annual commercial landings and MEDITS_ES surveys biomass index per haul (kg/km 2) were analyzed for the 1994 – 2016 period. Mapping the spatial distribution of biomass makes evident its occurrence in all the areas, particularly in GSA 1 {{and also in the}} South of GSA 6. Depth distribution shows that presence ranged from 55 to 741 m, being mainly located between 200 to 300 m depth. Biomass index average shows large yearly oscillations, particularly in GSA 1 decreasing beyond 2009. In contrast biomass indices in GSA 6 (South and North) and in GSA 5 increased steeply and synchronously from 2006 onwards, rebuilding the populations to similar levels of a previously observed maximum...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} <b>deep-water</b> ghost <b>shrimp</b> assemblages {{from the}} otherwise well known Oligocene Kiscell Clay in Hungary. The described fossorial shrimps (Decapoda: Callianassidae and Ctenochelidae) include: Ctenocheles rupeliensis (young-er synonym Callianassa nuda) and Lepidophthalmus crateriferus (younger synonym Callianassa brevimanus). The fos-sil material {{of the former}} species is assigned to Ctenocheles based on the morphology of the major cheliped, particularly the pectinate fingers, bulbous propodus, cup-shaped carpus and elongated merus. Lepidophthalmus crateriferus from the Oligocene of Hungary is the first unequivocal fossil record of the genus, which is distinguished in the fossil record {{on the basis of}} the presence of a meral blade and meral hook on the major cheliped. Lepidophthalmus is today known exclusively from shallow-water environments. The finding of a deep-water fossil representative of Lepidophthalmus therefore appears to be a reverse of the common pattern of groups shifting environments from onshore to offshore over geological time, as seen in many taxa. The presence of Lepidophthalmus crateriferus comb. nov. in the Kiscell Cla...|$|R
