Automated <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> usually incorporate a paint-saving system which recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear <b>spray</b> <b>system,</b> where automated <b>spray</b> guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than 12 in wide, such as window frames, wood moulding, baseboard, casing, trim stock and any other material that is simple in design. These machines are commonly used to apply stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a Bureau of Mines laboratory investigation of the effect of water sprays in reducing respirable dust that escaped the face area of a full-scale wooden model of a mine en-try containing a wooden model of a ripper-type continuous mining machine and exhaust brattice. Areas examined were (a) the general effectiveness of a low-pressure water <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> mounted on top of the mining machine boom, a high-pressure <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> mounted under the boom, and the combined top-and bottom-spray systems, and (b) the effect of these three <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> on the capture of coal dust particles of different sizes. Dust was injected into a sump cavity at the face. Airborne respirable dust concentration was mea-sured behind the brattice with a personal sampler and cyclone, and particle size distribution was mea-sured with a cascade impactor. When used alone, the top-spray system captured about 55 pct of the respirable dust in the face area and the bottom-spray system captured 60 pct; the capture efficiency of each system is decreased when they are used simultaneously. From a mass-concentration viewpoint, each <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> preferentially captures larger dust particles...|$|R

50|$|A {{graphene}} {{spray gun}} is a kinetic <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> that deposits, through supersonic acceleration, a one atom thick sheet of pure carbon named graphene {{by means of}} a de Laval nozzle, a pinched tube with an hourglass type shape. The system deposits graphene flakes and a hexagonal graphene lattice is created upon impact of the desired surface. The graphene spray gun would be utilized onto large-scale applications such as circuits, radio transmitters, and optical electronics due to the grapehene’s transparency and its remarkable conductivity of electricity. The supersonic <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> was first developed in May 2014 by University of Illinois professor Alexander Yarin, and Korea University professor Sam Yoon. Yarin went to Yoon when he learned about his work regarding kinetic <b>spray</b> deposition <b>systems.</b> Yarin believed that graphene could be applied to the system {{in order to create a}} layer of the material. After conducting experiments with the newly created system, they concluded that the graphene <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> was a success. The spray gun is still in its early stages of development, but is considered by many scientists and researchers to be the solution of various predicaments that occur when applying graphene onto large-scale products. The most common problem that would transpire within the other methods is that the layer would be uneven and coated by aggregations. The energy delivered by the supersonic spraying stretches the graphene evenly upon impact, and is the main reason for the <b>spray</b> <b>system’s</b> lack of defects that are common within other graphene deposition methods.|$|R
