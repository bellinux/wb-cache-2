5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and <b>fused</b> <b>elements</b> in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of pre-arcing time {{in the case of}} High Breaking Capacity fuses submitted to high fault currents. The <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> studied consist of silver fuse strips with reduced sections in their centre. During the fuse working the <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> is <b>fused</b> partly and hence vaporized. The time necessary to obtain an electric arc is called the pre-arcing time. This latter is defined by the duration from the appearance of the fault current to the splitting of the <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> due to the vaporization of the reduced sections. The mathematic model is based on the solution of the heat transfer equation, using an enthalpy formulation {{to take into account the}} phase transitions, supplemented by an energy source due to the heat produced by ohmic losses. In order to determine the current density evolution in the <b>fuse</b> <b>element,</b> the Laplace equation governing the electric potential and the Ohm's law are used.

25|$|The general {{structure}} of vertebrae in other animals is largely {{the same as}} in humans. Individual vertebrae are composed of a centrum (body), arches protruding from {{the top and bottom of}} the centrum, and various processes projecting from the centrum and/or arches. An arch extending from the top of the centrum is called a neural arch, while the haemal arch or chevron is found underneath the centrum in the caudal (tail) vertebrae of fish, most reptiles, some birds, some dinosaurs and some mammals with long tails. The vertebral processes can either give the structure rigidity, help them articulate with ribs, or serve as muscle attachment points. Common types are transverse process, diapophyses, parapophyses, and zygapophyses (both the cranial zygapophyses and the caudal zygapophyses). The centrum of the vertebra can be classified based on the fusion of its elements. In temnospondyls, bones such as the spinous process, the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum are separate ossifications. <b>Fused</b> <b>elements,</b> however, classify a vertebra as having holospondyly.|$|E
500|$|Stars with initial masses {{less than}} about eight times the sun never develop a core {{large enough to}} {{collapse}} and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs. [...] Stars with at least [...] (possibly as much as [...] ) evolve in a complex fashion, progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores.

Although popularly described as an onion with an iron core, the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen-neon(-magnesium) cores. These super AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae, although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors.|$|E
40|$|This work models the {{function}} of medium and low voltage fuses so as to estimate the increase in temperature across the <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> during nominal current operation for different types, diameters, element lengths and currents. The power balance in a thin metallic conductor, which simulates the <b>fuse</b> <b>element,</b> was derived and the resulting differential equation solved analytically. The theoretical results were close to the experimental measurements that we made, and the experimental work of other authors. The mathematical model that was developed will be useful {{in the design of}} fuses, as the computation of the axial temperature distribution across the <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> for the different parameters mentioned above is relatively simple.

40|$|This thesis {{essentially}} {{presents the}} experimental {{investigation of the}} fundamental phenomena of electric <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> disintegration and its causation and influence on the subsequent fragmentation of the <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> when subjected to excessive fault currents. The basis of the study involved experimental observation of disintegration of <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> and {{the analysis of the}} dynamic responses of current-carrying conductors, which precipitate disintegration. The experimental techniques employed utilised commercially available video cameras to capture images of element disruptions during disintegration of <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> subjected to low short-circuit and high overload currents. Specialist experimental image capturing techniques and hardware implementations were developed to enable investigation of element disintegration caused by high short-circuit fault currents. Disintegration phenomena of <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> for all fault cases were compared within different time domains, which included specialist techniques to investigate disintegration of elements in sand and against glass substrates. Disintegration phenomena of elements in unconfined media such as air and water also constituted the studies. The studies diverged, finally, into experimental observations of the temporal development of arc initiation and extinction phenomena of fault current limiting of HBC fuses using spectroscopic analysis of the arc light radiation. The range of studies covered have led to new understandings of fundamental current limiting behaviour of HBC and open type fuses which contribute, in a small way, to the knowledge base of the subject and hopefully will be an aid to improved designs and development of new types of electric fuse...|$|R

[...] These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead [...] "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world". The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012.

2500|$|Bernstein was {{an eclectic}} {{composer}} whose music <b>fused</b> <b>elements</b> of jazz, Jewish music, theatre {{music and the}} work of earlier composers like Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, George Gershwin, and Marc Blitzstein. Some of his works, especially his score for West Side Story, helped bridge the gap between classical and popular music. His music was rooted in tonality but in some works like his Kaddish Symphony and the opera A Quiet Place he mixed in 12-tone elements. Bernstein himself said his main motivation for composing was [...] "to communicate" [...] and that all his pieces, including his symphonies and concert works, [...] "could in some sense be thought of as 'theatre' pieces." [...] According to the League of American orchestras, he was the second most frequently performed American composer by U.S. orchestras in 2008–09 behind Copland, and he was the 16th most frequently performed composer overall by U.S. orchestras. (Some performances were probably due to the 2008 90th anniversary of his birth.) His most popular pieces were the Overture to Candide, the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, the Serenade for Violin, Strings, Harp and Percussion and the Three Dance Episodes from On the Town. His shows West Side Story, On the Town, Wonderful Town and Candide are regularly performed, and his symphonies and concert works are programmed from time to time by orchestras around the world. Since his death many of his works have been commercially recorded by artists other than himself. The Serenade, which has been recorded more than 10 times, is probably his most recorded work not taken from an actual theatre piece.|$|E
