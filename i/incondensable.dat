Les expériences furent réalisées en {{condition}} de gravité terrestre, en vol parabolique et en fusée-sonde. Les expériences en vol parabolique ont montré l'influence de divers paramètres sur le transfert thermique et ont mis en évidence les mécanismes contro lant le transfert thermique. De l'écriture des équations gouvernant ces mécanismes et de l'identification des échelles caractéristiques, une corrélation permettant d'estimer le transfert de chaleur lors de l'ébullition en microgravité pour une large gamme de fluide est bâtie. L'expérience en fusée-sonde a permis d'étudier l'influence des gaz <b>incondensables</b> et notamment de la convection Marangoni sur le comportement de l'ébullition et sur le transfert thermique. Between {{the different}} propulsion phases, the Ariane V rocket passes through microgravity periods and solar radiation can induce boiling in its cryogenics tanks. Experiments were performed during 6 parabolic flights {{and in a}} sounding rocket to study pool boiling in microgravity. In the parabolic flight experiments, the influence of pressure, subcooling and surface roughness was studied. It is showed that subcooling has a weak effect on microgravity boiling heat transfer, and that roughness {{is an important factor}} also in microgravity. Detailed results on the behavior of bubbles and on the superheated liquid layer show that the heat transfer mechanisms can be divided in two groups : the primary mechanisms which directly take energy from the wall and the secondary mechanisms which transport the energy stored in the fluid by the primary mechanisms, from the vicinity of the wall to the bulk liquid. The secondary mechanisms appear not to limit primary mechanism heat transfer which explains the weak influence of gravity on heat transfer. From the study of equations governing primary mechanisms and the definition of new scales, a correlation is built to predict heat transfer in microgravity {{for a wide variety of}} fluids. In the sounding rocket experiment, the influence of non-condensable gases was studied. The existence of two regimes of boiling heat transfer with non-condensable gas is established. The temperature in the primary bubble is directly measured and the influences of both Marangoni convection and non-condensable gas on both heat transfer and bubble growth are also considered.

They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing <b>incondensable</b> gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30-50 mbar.

40|$|Vessels {{operating}} under vacuum, such as vacuum pans and final effect evaporators, require a vacuum pump to remove <b>incondensable</b> gasses that accumulate within the vessel. The vacuum pumps {{need to be}} sized to remove <b>incondensable</b> gasses from four possible sources: those that enter with the feed into the vessel, direct leaks from the atmosphere into the vessel, dissolved and entrained gas that is released from injection water used in direct contact condensers, and gas that is contained in steam vented into the vessel body. It is often necessary to discover why a process vessel is unable to maintain the design vacuum. If the condenser is capable of adequately cooling the gas stream entering the vacuum pump, an inability to maintain the design vacuum within the vessel is an indicator of either insufficient pump capacity or excessive quantity of <b>incondensable</b> gas. To diagnose {{the cause of the}} problem, pump performance can be checked by measuring the performance of the vacuum pump, off-line, using a simple test rig, whilst the possibility of excessive quantities of gas are normally investigated only by using a standard vacuum test on an empty vessel to estimate the quantity of the air leakage into the vessel. As an alternative to off-line pump testing and the conventional vacuum test for leaks, a measurement of the quantity of <b>incondensable</b> gas being discharged from the vacuum pump during normal operation provides a very useful diagnostic test. The test provides a direct measure of the load (of <b>incondensable</b> gas) on the pump whilst also providing a single point on the pump curve and thus can give an instantaneous indication of the reason for the inability to maintain the design vacuum.

The expansion of such a mixture involves thermodynamic processes very different from those related {{to the expansion of}} pure steam (as it happens in conventional steam power plants) or to the expansion of a gaseous mixture without steam condensation (as it happens in gas turbine power plants, combined and mixed cycles). In this paper these thermodynamic processes are investigated and an evaluating method is developed. In particular using this method it is possible to evaluate the excess turbine back pressure, that is the pressure increase with respect to the steam saturation pressure, and the specific expansion work of the mixture. The proposed method is then applied in order to evaluate the performance of an hydrogen/oxygen (fuel/oxidiser) cycle, where the presence of <b>incondensable</b> gases into condensing steam is unavoidable owing to the processes that give H 2 from fossil fuels and O 2 from air.

40|$|First of all, the {{objective}} of the thesis is to improve the comprehension of <b>incondensable</b> compressible flows in ejectors for all states of flow susceptible to appear. For that reason, {{in the first part of}} the thesis, the physics of compressible flows was studied with emphasis on implementation of numerical methods, more specifically on turbulence models used. Standard k -[varepsilon] turbulence model was selected because it simulates adequately flow phenomena present in dry air powered ejectors. This is a sine qua non condition for the application of a model on to more complex flows such as flow with condensation. A thorough parametric study of ejectors operation gave prominence to particular operation regimes. This is one of this work's originalities since only little of those phenomena have been studied to this day. Furthermore, this first part allows a better anticipation of ejectors regimes and, therefore, facilitates their design. The second part of this thesis takes into account phenomenology of condensation/evaporation by adding it to the <b>incondensable</b> flow models while using the results of the parametric study. An experimental study based on visualisations of an ejector condensation zone is used for comparison. The complete study was realized with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT in which a 2 D axisymetric model of condensation in high speed flow was implemented. Mass condensation fields in ejectors obtained by simulation are compared to experimental laser tomography measurements. It was emphasized that these measurements were in agreement with the numerical results.

Then, a comparison between air-steam-hydrogen and air-steam-helium mixtures has been performed. Good agreement between the two mixtures properties was found in relation to the total heat flux and the condensing mass flux, showing that the substitution of hydrogen with helium (which is usually made in experimental facilities) grants a really good approximation.

Impurities and/or other constituents selected for co-sequestration can affect both the chemical and physical (e. g. density, viscosity, interfacial tension) behavior of CO 2 in the deep subsurface. These impurities and concentrations are a function of both the industrial source(s) of the CO 2, as well as the carbon capture technology used to extract the CO 2 and produce a concentrated stream for geologic sequestration. This report summarizes the relative concentrations of CO 2 and other constituents in exhaust gases from major non-energy related industrial sources of CO 2.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} {{the process of}} growth, collapse and rebound of a cavitation bubble travelling along the flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle producing a cavitating water jet is established. The model {{is based on the}} Rayleigh-Plesset bubble dynamics equation using as inputs ambient pressure and velocity profiles calculated with the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow modelling. A variable time-step technique is applied to solve the highly nonlinear second-order differential equation. This technique successfully solves the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for wide ranges of pressure variation and bubble original size and saves considerable computing time. Inputs for this model are the pressure and velocity data from CFD calculation. To simulate accurately the process of bubble growth, collapse and rebound, a heat transfer model, which includes the effects of conduction plus radiation, is developed to describe the thermodynamics of the <b>incondensable</b> gas inside the bubble.

In March 2014, measurements of soil CO 2 fluxes in 5 of these sites (namely, Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I, Las Maquinitas II, Anfiteatro, and Termas de Copahue) allowed an estimation that ~ 165 t of deeply derived CO 2 is daily released. The gas source is likely related to a relatively shallow geothermal reservoir containing a single vapor phase as also suggested by both the geochemical data from the 3 deep wells drilled in the 1980 s and gas geoindicators applied to the fumarolic discharges. Gas equilibria within the H-C-O gas system indicate the presence of a large, probably unique, single phase vapor zone at 200 - 210 °C feeding the hydrothermal manifestations of Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I and II and Termas de Copahue.

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} investigation on {{the feasibility of}} propagating a smoldering front in reaction-trailing mode throughout an oil shale semicoke porous medium are reported. For oil recovery applications, this mode is particularly interesting to avoid low-temperature oxidation reactions, which appear simultaneously with organic matter devolatilization in the reaction-leading mode and are responsible for oxidation of part of the heavy oil. The particularity of this mode is that, contrary to the reaction-leading mode largely studied in the literature, the heat-transfer layer precedes the combustion layer. This leads to two separated high-temperature zones: (i) a devolatilization zone (free of oxygen), where the organic matter is thermally decomposed to <b>incondensable</b> gases, heavy oil, andfixed carbon, also called coke in the literature, without any oxidation, followed by (ii) an oxidation zone, where thefixed carbon left by devolatilization is oxidized. The transition from reaction-leading to reaction-trailing mode was obtained using low oxygen contents in the fed air. It is shown that two distinct layers, the heat-transfer layer and the combustion layer, propagate in a stable and repeatable way. The decrease of the oxygen fraction leads to a decrease of the smoldering temperature and to strongly limit the decarbonation of the mineral matrix. The CO 2 emissions are limited. Regardless of the front temperature, all of the fed oxygen is consumed and all of thefixed carbon is oxidized at {{the passage of the}} smoldering front...|$|E

This water suppression tank (VVPSS) is so aiming at limiting the maximum pressure in the VV to 0. 2. MPa during in-vessel coolant leak events and at maintaining the VV long-term pressure below atmospheric pressure during air or <b>incondensable</b> gases ingress, through the Direct Contact Condensation (DCC). The novelty of this study resides especially in the working condition of VVPSS, which operates precisely to sub-atmospheric pressure: up to date no explicit experimental data or investigation of DCC are in fact available in literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} {{experimental studies of}} low energy microplasma discharges in liquid and the model studies of microdischarge-generated microbubbles in liquid. The main focus {{is to determine the}} properties of the microbubble and relate them to the initiation and dynamics of the observed microplasma. Microplasma in liquid began to draw researchers? attention in recent decades because of its low energy input, micron scale size and nanosecond scale duration. The understanding of plasma discharges in gases has been well established; however, the mechanism of plasma initiation in liquid is still unclear. Several theories were proposed to provide different explanations of this mechanism, but none of them have been proven exclusively correct. Results here show that the generation of a microplasma needs higher energy than the generation of a microbubble from the same discharges. This supports the theory that during the microplasma initiation a lower density gaseous site is generated before the microplasma and the microplasma exists inside a microbubble. The typical form of a plasma and bubbles in liquid reported in literature are branch-like structures. Here we report spherical microplasma and microbubble afforded by relatively lower energy input, and it was found that for branched bubbles increasing the ambient pressure was able to reduce the microbubble size and eliminate its branches. The dynamics of the spherical bubbles could be modeled with a customized Rayleigh-Plesset model considering both condensable and <b>incondensable</b> gases in the bubble, the initial neutral temperature and neutral pressure were estimated to be as high as 550 K and 1. 2 GPa...|$|E

This pilot unit consisted of six vertical fixed bed reactors in parallel, {{each with a}} capacity of 12 kg GST. Thermolysis proceeded in a normal air atmosphere. The solid (char), liquid (tyre-derived oil [TDO]) and gaseous products generated at each temperature were characterised.

The yields of the gas, TDO and char fractions were 15 – 22 wt. %, 34 – 46 wt. % and 39 – 44 wt. % respectively, values that represent major recoveries from the GST feedstock. The TDOs were mainly a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and had very high GCVs (41 – 43 MJ/kg), {{higher than those of}} conventional liquid fuels. A large increase was seen in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content above 550 °C.

Permeability measurements showed that thermal history affects relevantly the diffusion of gas molecules across the membrane, influencing also the stability of the separation performances. Subsequently, the effect of water on Matrimid transport properties has been characterized for a wide set of <b>incondensable</b> penetrants. A monotonous reduction of permeability took place at increasing the water concentration within the polymer matrix, affecting the investigated gaseous species to the same extent, despite the different thermodynamic and kinetic features. In this view, a novel empirical model, based on the Free Volume Theory, has been proposed to qualitatively describe the phenomenon. Moreover, according to the accurate representation of the experimental data, the suggested approach has been combined with a more rigorous thermodynamic tool (NELF Model), allowing an exhaustive description of water influence on the single parameters contributing to the gas permeation across the membrane. In the second part, the study has focused on the synthesis and characterization of facilitated transport membranes, able to achieving outstanding separation performances thanks to the chemical enhancement of CO 2 permeability. In particular, the transport properties have been investigated for high pressure CO 2 separation applications and specific solutions have been proposed to solve stability issues, frequently arising under such severe conditions. Finally, the effect of different process parameters have been investigated, aiming at the identification of the optimal conditions capable to maximize the separation performance...|$|E

In the study of growth/evaporation of particles due to (water) vapour in the atmosphere, it is usual {{to assume that the}} vapour is diluted and the temperature is uniform enough in the environment. These assumptions cannot be applied to heat exchanger condensers, where the gas mixture is enriched in water vapour (vs. the concentration of an <b>incondensable).</b> An added difficulty is the large value of water latent heat. Therefore, the equations that describe the phenomenon in the atmosphere should be corrected We present a model for vapour condensation in a double pipe best exchanger. The main physical processes in the gas/aerosol atmosphere flowing between coaxial cylinders, being the internal one cooled by a refrigerant, are modellized. The model takes into account: conduction and convection; film vapour condensation; the aerosol particle size distribution (PSD); heterogeneous nucleation in non-diluted conditions; some particle phenomena: gravitational and turbulent deposition, thermophoresis and difussiophoresis; and mass, momentum and energy balances in the heat exchanger. ln the model, the particles (liquid water coming from condensed vapour with a log-normal PSD) are injected in the system at the heat exchanger inlet. Future model improvements will include particles formation by homogeneous nucleation. Results of the model application are truly plausible. For example, the mean size of the particles grows as the flow runs {{towards the end of the}} exchanger, but some of them disappesr eventually. AB it could be expected, the main condensation occurs at the liquid film interface of the interior due to the greater temperature difference at these points. The presence of particles leads to a diminishing of the condensed vapour as compared with the case without particles (only vapour in gas phase). ej 201...|$|E
40|$|The sizing of {{emergency}} relief vents to mitigate runaway chemical reactions in batch or semi-batch reactors {{is important for}} the protection of the workers and the process unit. This has been a preoccupation in industry for many years and different design methods have been proposed depending on the type of system (gassy, vapor, or hybrid) and the flow characteristics of the reacting fluid. Industry needs simple, reliable and accurate sizing methods so as not to undersize nor oversize the vent area. In the present work, runaway reactions in two chemical systems were studied experimentally with various apparatuses in volumes from 30 µl up to 10 liters (DSC, PHI-TEC I, ARSST, VSP 2, Vent Sizing Simulator, 800 ml reactor, and the standard 10 liter vessel used for the United Nations test for sizing rupture disks for vessels containing self-reactive materials). The two systems were the decomposition of a solution of DiButylPeroxide in butyrate and the esterification of acetic anhydride by methanol. The first system is virtually purely gassy, meaning that the overpressure in the vessel during runaway is produced by <b>incondensable</b> gas while the second is purely vapor, meaning that the overpressure is due to the vapor pressure of the reaction mass as the temperature rises. The data recorded were used to determine the A/V ratio for the emergency relief vent or rupture disk for a 1 m 3 vessel. Two categories of sizing methods were used. The similarity method was employed, whereby the A/V ratio is directly determined experimentally for a given set of conditions, with three reactors : 0. 11, 0, 8 and 10 liters. The calculation method was based on the DIERS approach and was employed using the data from bench-scale pseudo-adiabatic calorimeters. The results show that the similarity method predicts vent sizes which are much smaller than those predicted by the DIERS approach...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) from biomass {{gasification}} {{is viewed}} as a promising option for production of transport fuels. A major problem associated is the removal of contaminants derived from the gasification step, such as tars. Tars are aromatic compounds, usually between 1 and 5 rings, which at 350 ˚C already start to condensate, causing clogging and blockage of components. Catalytic tar conversion presents advantages compared to other technologies and in particular it allows thermal integration with the gasification step, lowering the thermodynamic losses, and enables the use of the energy contained in the tars by converting them into usable gases, such as H 2 and CO. Catalyst deactivation can be caused by coke deposits. A novel technique named Chemical-looping reforming (CLR), based on Chemical-looping combustion concept (CLC), is being developed in Chalmers University of Technology to tackle this problem. It is based in a two reactor system, one Fuel reactor (FR) and an Air reactor (AR). In the FR the tars are oxidized due to the reduction of the catalyst. In the AR the catalyst is newly oxidized and the coke deposits are combusted. The present work intends to analyze raw data, measured from a bench-size CLR facility using different catalysts and O 2 concentrations in the AR, in order to elaborate a descriptive model of the system in order to assess how the reforming step influences the fate of the <b>incondensable</b> gases (H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8, and N 2) This is achieved by firstly elaborating a molar balance to both reactors taking into account the system main constitutes (Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen and Nitrogen) and afterwards implementing it in Matlab, in order to solve the balance. The model was elaborated using commercial flow-sheet software called Aspen Plus...|$|E
40|$|The need of {{producing}} energy from renewable resources {{has brought in}} the course of time to the development of several “clean” technologies. Pyrolysis-based energy densification processes of biomass residues are more and more becoming an interesting route for bio-oil production. Pyrolysis is the chemical decomposition of organic materials, i. e. biomass, by application of heat in the absence of oxygen. During pyrolysis processes, biomass is converted into a solid fraction (char), a liquid phase (tar) and <b>incondensable</b> gases (e. g. hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide). The high heating values of these fractions are usually exploited to produce energy. The chemical characterization of the pyrolysis products, and in particular of tar components, is usually a list of very different substances, that usually are more harmful than the biomass feed. Thus, the safety of pyrolysis prcesses may be affected by the possible harm of the products formed. As a matter of facts, accidental conditions occurring in a pyrolysis process may lead to the undesired dispersion of these products, whose effects on humans and environment have to be quantified. Moreover, the actual understanding of the inherent hazards of bio-fuels with respect to conventional fuels should be a core issue for the sustainability assessment of bio-energy processes. The aim of the present study is the development of a specific approach to characterize the hazard of the products formed during pyrolysis processes. Conventional experimental protocols were applied to screen the possible pyrolysis products. A specific methodology based on toxicological, physical and chemical parameters was then applied for the assessment of the hazard due to these products. The methodology was applied to understand the potential harm of bio-oil formed in the pyrolysis of some biomass samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{next step}} for many CO 2 capture {{technologies}} {{is to move}} to commercial scale [1]. Without the experience {{that can only be}} gained through pilot plants, CCS will not become a commercially viable proposition due to unresolved technical challenges and uncertain cost estimations. Individual demonstration projects need to be at a scale that is sufficiently large to be representative of commercial operation. One of these individual projects was carried out by Fundación Ciudad de la Energía (CIUDEN), who successfully completed the full CO 2 capture process in its Technology Development Centre for CO 2 Capture and Transport using oxycombustion in Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boiler and a cryogenic CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). Focused on the CIUDEŃs CPU, this paper describes the unit designed by Air Liquide, their sub-units in which the CO 2 composition is increased to achieve the design value of > 99. 0 % v in the liquefied product stream and a final case study based on an empirical mass balance; considering this data, in addition to the CO 2 purity, a mass balance provides the recovery rate value; this last parameter was lower than the expected value. Studying the specific behaviour of each subunit, it is concluded that the warm-part of the CPU presents a recovery rate higher than 99 % whereas the cold part of the unit (expansion and distillation columns to remove NOx and <b>incondensable</b> gases) obtained an average value of 60 %, generated mainly because the CO 2 composition in the inlet of the CPU was lower than 70 % v w/b (design value). This was due to higher N 2 content in the flue gas. Considering these results, the conclusions are very clear that air infiltration must be minimised. It also demonstrates the necessity of increasing the quantity of operating hours on demonstration plants such as CIUDEN in order to further optimise the technology with the end goal of improving the business case for CCS...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{pyrolysis}} of pine wood sawdust {{was carried}} out by microwave heating at ca. 470 degrees C under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. Eight inorganic additives (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3, Na 2 SiO 3, NaCl, TiO 2, HZSM- 5, H 3 PO 4, Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3)) were investigated in terms of their catalytic effects on the pyrolysis. All of the eight additives have increased yields of solid products greatly and decreased yields of gaseous products more or less. Yields of liquid products have not subjected to dramatic change. The <b>incondensable</b> gases produced from pyrolysis consist mainly of H- 2, CH 4, CO and CO 2. All of the eight additives have made these gases evolve earlier, among which the four sodium additives have the most marked effect. All the additives have made the amount of CH 4 and CO 2 decrease, while all of them except NaCl, TiO 2 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) have made that of H- 2 increase and all of them except Na 2 SiO 3 and HZSM- 5 have made that of CO decrease. Alkaline sodium compounds NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 and Na 2 SiO 3 favor H- 2 formation most. The most abundant organic component in the liquid products from pyrolysis of untreated sample and samples treated by all the additives except H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) is acetol. All the four sodium compounds favor acetol formation reaction and the selection increasing effect follows the order of NaOH > Na 2 CO 3 approximate to Na 2 SiO 3 > NaCl. TiO 2 goes against the formation of acetol, HZSM- 5 has no marked effect on acetol formation. The two dominant organic components identified in the liquid products from pyrolysis of H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) treated samples are both fufural and 4 -methyl- 2 -methoxy-phenol. A possible pathway for acetol formation is tentatively proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
