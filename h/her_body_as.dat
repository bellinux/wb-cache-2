Using <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>as</b> a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr.

25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} {{bonds between}} parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring.

The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>as</b> a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E
25|$|Her 2004 {{season was}} pivotal for her career: she reduced her 5000m best {{significantly}} to 14:35.18 minutes and gained {{a spot on}} the Ethiopian Olympic team.

Despite her athletic breakthrough, that year also took its toll on <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>as</b> she acquired a long-term problem in her heel and calf which affected her running. She ran an indoor 3000m personal best of 8:46.67 minutes at the 2005 Boston Indoor Games, but her outdoor season fizzled out as she did not qualify for the 2005 World Championships in Athletics.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Khalifa said the controversial scene was satirical and should be taken as such, claiming that Hollywood films depicted Muslims in a far more negative light than any pornographer could.
