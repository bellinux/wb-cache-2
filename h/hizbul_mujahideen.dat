5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Ijaz was {{involved}} in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Kashmir, the cause of multiple wars between India and Pakistan since independence. He {{held a series of}} meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas. Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of India's intelligence directorate, Dar declared a unilateral ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen,</b> widely believed to have been supported by Pakistani intelligence. In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in Kashmir, Ijaz met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 (8 July 2016 – present) unrest erupted after {{killing of}} a <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> militant Burhan Wani by Indian {{security}} forces.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July 2012, Al-Badar Mujahideen, a {{breakaway}} {{faction of}} Kashmir centric terror group <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen,</b> on {{the conclusion of}} their two-day Shuhada Conference called for a mobilization of resources for continuation of jihad in Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{militant groups}} have since taken root in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Most noticeable {{of these groups}} are Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM). A 1996 report by Human Rights Watch estimated the number of active mujahideen at 3,200.|$|E
25|$|The {{displaced}} Pandits, many of {{who continue}} to live in temporary refugee camps in Jammu and Delhi, are still unable to safely return to their homeland. The lead in this act of ethnic cleansing was initially taken by the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front and the <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen.</b> According to Indian media, all this happened at the instigation of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) by a group of Kashmiri terrorist elements who were trained, armed and motivated by the ISI. Reportedly, organisations trained and armed by the ISI continued this ethnic cleansing until practically all the Kashmiri Pandits were driven out after having been subjected to numerous indignities and brutalities such as rape of their women, torture, forcible seizure of property etc.|$|E
500|$|Ijaz carried Musharraf's {{message to}} senior Indian officials, {{including}} India's then-deputy intelligence chief, C. D. Sahay. Sahay and Ijaz {{worked together to}} develop a comprehensive blueprint for participation of a wider cross-section of Kashmiri resistance groups, particularly militant groups operating from Pakistan-held Kashmir. In late summer 2000, Ijaz traveled to Muzaffarabad to negotiate with <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> commander Syed Salahuddin. That meeting resulted in Salahuddin [...] to President Clinton, hand-carried to the White House by Ijaz, in which the Kashmiri leader requested Clinton's support for Salahuddin's further steps in Kashmiri ceasefire negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Pakistani and {{hospital}} sources gave a death toll of eleven dead and fifty-three wounded. Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid writes that 20 Afghans, seven Pakistanis, three Yemenis, two Egyptians, one Saudi and one Turk were killed. Initial reports by Pakistani intelligence chief Chaudhry Manzoor and a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that a missile had landed in Pakistan and killed six Pakistanis; the government later retracted the statement and fired Manzoor for the incorrect report. However, the 9/11 Commission Report states that Clinton later called Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif [...] "to apologize for a wayward missile that had killed several {{people in a}} Pakistani village." [...] One 1998 U.S. News & World Report article suggested {{that most of the}} strike's victims were Pakistani militants bound for the Kashmiri insurgency, rather than al-Qaeda members; the operation killed a number of ISI officers present in the camps. A 1999 press report stated that seven Harkat Ansar militants were killed and 24 were wounded, while eight Lashkar-e-Taiba and <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> members were killed. In a May 1999 meeting with American diplomats, Haqqani said his facilities had been destroyed and 25 of his men killed in the operation.|$|E
500|$|Four U.S. Navy {{ships and}} the {{submarine}} USS Columbia, {{stationed in the}} Arabian Sea, fired between 60 and 75 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Afghanistan at the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr camp complex in the Khost region, which included a base camp, a support camp, and four training camps. Peter Bergen identifies the targeted camps, located in Afghanistan's [...] "Pashtun belt," [...] as al-Badr 1 and 2, al-Farooq, Khalid bin Walid, Abu Jindal, and Salman Farsi; other sources identify the Muawia, Jihad Wahl, and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami camps as targets. According to Shelton, the base camp housed [...] "storage, housing, training and administration facilities for the complex," [...] while the support camp included weapons-storage facilities and managed the site's logistics. Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group also used the Khost camps, as well as Pakistani militant groups fighting an insurgency in Kashmir, such as Harkat Ansar, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen.</b> The rudimentary camps, reputedly run by Taliban official Jalaluddin Haqqani, were frequented by Arab, Chechen, and Central Asian militants, {{as well as the}} ISI. The missiles hit at roughly 10:00 PM Khost time (17:30 GMT); as in Sudan, the strikes were launched at night to avoid collateral damage. In contrast to the attack on Al-Shifa, the strike on the Afghan camps was uncontroversial.|$|E
2500|$|One {{ideology}} that {{plays a role}} in terrorism by using the name of Islam, is Wahabism. Wahabism and its allies including Salafism (Salafi jihadism) supports war against any one and every one who is not like them. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab (militant group), Boko Haram, Indonesian Mujahedeen Council, Taliban, Sipah Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> follow intolerant Wahabi or Salafi ideology which is opposed by other Muslims. Non-Muslims, Sufis, and Shias are attacked by hard-core Wahhabis, Deobandis, and jamaatis {{in the same way that}} socialists and other leftist proletarians were assaulted by Mussolini's bandits, Jews and others by the Nazis, and [...] "bourgeois", [...] "kulak", intellectual, Jewish, [...] "Menshevik", and [...] "Trotskyist" [...] dissenters were assaulted by Stalinists. In India, Wahabism was spread in the name of Deobandi movement, which was opposed by more tolerant Sufi oriented Indian Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Badr & <b>Hizbul</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> are {{militant groups}} seeking {{accession}} of Kashmir to Pakistan from India. The Lashkar leadership describes Indian and Israel regimes {{as the main}} enemies of Islam and Pakistan that is an extremist thought but is not real. Lashkar-e-Toiba, along with Jaish-e-Mohammed, another militant group active in Kashmir are on the United States’ foreign terrorist organizations list, and are also designated as terrorist groups by the United Kingdom, India, Australia and Pakistan. Jaish-e-Mohammed was formed in 1994 and has carried {{out a series of}} attacks all over India. The group was formed after the supporters of Maulana Masood Azhar split from another Islamic militant organization, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Jaish-e-Mohammed is viewed by some as the [...] "deadliest" [...] and [...] "the principal terrorist organization in Jammu and Kashmir". The group was also implicated in the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl. All these groups coordinate under leadership of Syed Salahuddin's United Jihad Council.|$|E
