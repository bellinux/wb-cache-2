50|$|<b>Shutoff</b> <b>Valves</b> - After {{a lesson}} by Geoff on {{compression}} fittings, the contestants must install <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> on the plumbing fixtures of their bathroom sinks. Eric does so with no difficulty, while Angie and Brian fail to tighten their valves. Johnnie {{has a much}} more complicated challenge than everyone else, as he inadvertently fractured the water pipes during Episode 2, forcing him to remove the old pipes and solder in new ones. He actually manages this successfully, but fails to attach the <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves,</b> first attaching them too loosely, and then accidentally disassembling them altogether.|$|R

50|$|The mask has {{an inner}} orinasal mask {{to cut down}} on dead-space. It does not have a <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve.</b> It has a wooden plug {{fastened}} to it by a light chain; that plug fits into the breathing tube entry inside the mask to stop debris from entering, but is not a watertight seal. The mask and its tube unscrews from the canister and can be replaced by a tube ending in a mouthpiece. The mouthpiece tube has a <b>shutoff</b> <b>valve</b> at the mouthpiece. The Salvus mouthpiece also has an attached noseclip. A pair of industrial-type eyes-only goggles was included with the set when it came. That mouthpiece has an outer flap that goes outside the lips and is extended into straps fastened behind the neck.|$|R

5000|$|The {{investigators}} {{also noted}} that the steel clamp used to lock the hose connected to the gas range’s nozzle was found far from where it should be, which meant that the workers did not properly refit the hose,“This is the proximate cause of the gas leak.

50|$|A plant {{operator}} heard the escaping propylene and the expanding vapor cloud. He notified the plant's control {{room of the}} problem.

40|$|WSSPC {{recommends}} that each state, province or territory which is considering implementing requirements for installing automatic gas shutoff devices in industrial, commercial and/or residential applications assure that <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> meet {{the provisions of}} the most currently available revision of ANSI/ASCE/SEI Standard 25 (Earthquake-Actuated Automatic Gas Shutoff Devices) and be installed in conformance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. The cost versus benefit of turning gas on after an event or the analysis of false activation is left to the jurisdiction. The policy only advocates that if a decision is made to proceed with earthquake actuated automatic gas shutoff devices that the current state-of-the-art provisions be utilized. Executive Summary Natural gas piping and appliances may be damaged during earthquakes, causing gas leaks. These leaks, if ignited, can result in fires and explosions which may jeopardize personal safety as well as resulting in significant damage to structures. Fires and explosions may be more destructive to buildings than the earthquake itself. The ability to manually shut off a gas valve after an earthquake may be difficult or impossible due to debris or ground movement. Risk of gas related damage is further exacerbated if structures are unoccupied, thus placing the burden of shutting off gas service upon utilities or government agencies. The reliability of automatic gas <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> has been greatly improved with the adoption o...|$|R
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and <b>shutoff</b> <b>valves</b> on both inlet and outlet.
