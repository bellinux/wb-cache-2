5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters and asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> attack {{in an effort to}} relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted {{her husband to}} decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E

60|$|Thirdly, That {{he could}} have stood it out longer, but that <b>he</b> was {{sensible}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> but diminish the stock, which, considering his debts, was properly not his own; {{and that he was}} resolved not to spend one part of their debts, as he had lost the other.|$|R
50|$|News travels fast, and by {{the time}} he gets there the {{bartender}} asks him <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> having trouble. <b>If</b> so <b>he</b> <b>should</b> talk to Arthur and Wendy-the-Rat for advice on what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do about it. He approaches them at their table, and after some strategic conversation, they step outside to talk in private.|$|R
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{saw that}} the Umayyads' left wing was holding steady, Ibn al-Ashtar changed tack and ordered his troops to attack the Umayyads' center, believing if he could {{disperse}} the core of the Umayyad army, the latter's right and left wings would likewise disperse. Ibn al-Ashtar himself took part in this assault and is said to have slew several Umayyad soldiers with his coterie of close companions. Amid the heavy clashes, numerous men on both sides were killed and the Umayyads were routed, Upon witnessing this, Umayr ibn al-Hubab communicated to Ibn al-Ashtar <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> defect to his camp; Ibn al-Ashtar told him to hold off because he feared his men would harm Umayr amid their anger.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minutes after}} initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other, {{at about the}} same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated {{ordering}} their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks stacked with high explosive (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, was momentarily uncertain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and delayed too long in acting.|$|E
60|$|Toby {{had always}} had a {{wholesome}} dread of a gun; but his fear became greater than ever when he saw how much mischief could be done with one as near a total wreck as that was, for Uncle Daniel had seated himself on the grass, regardless of the dew, and was hugging his foot as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared <b>he</b> <b>should</b> lose it.|$|R
60|$|But Henry {{said he did}} {{not think}} of {{catching}} a little fish in his dipper, when he lent it to Rollo. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have lent it to him. He only lent it to him to get raspberries in. But Rollo insisted that he had lent it to him for the whole expedition, and to put any thing in it he pleased.|$|R
6000|$|Brangwen {{was staring}} {{away at the}} burning blue window {{at the back of}} the altar, and {{wondering}} vaguely, with pain, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>should</b> get old, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>should</b> feel arrived and established. He was here at Anna's wedding. Well, what right had he to feel responsible, like a father? He was still as unsure and unfixed as when he had married himself. His wife and he! With a pang of anguish he realized what uncertainties they both were. He was a man of forty-five. Forty-five! In five more years fifty. Then sixty--then seventy--then it was finished. My God--and one still was so unestablished! ...|$|R
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Alan Eagleson, a {{longtime}} {{executive director of}} the National Hockey League Players Association, was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} from the National Hockey League Players' Association pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be expelled from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay and Brad Park, campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.|$|E

5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto and asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa {{on behalf of his}} elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up homesickness in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to the annoyance of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E
5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building {{has never had}} a second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some time ago and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode, leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E

5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E

25|$|The main {{favourite}} was (then) six-time winner Armstrong (now {{stripped of}} all his victories). Armstrong had had doubts <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> start the 2005 Tour, but decided in February 2005 that he would race. His main rival Ullrich was happy with this decision, as {{he thought it would}} be a better race with Armstrong present.|$|E
60|$|He {{said all}} this with so much feeling that Mrs Peter began to cry, and, with her apron up to her eyes, said that she didn't {{want him to go}} blind; but even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> never want, for she would work herself to the bone to keep him. Peter waved his hand in tragic deprecation. No, he would beg his bread from door to door; he would sleep by the {{roadside}} in the bitter winter night.|$|R
60|$|Next day, at {{the prayer}} of Miriam, Gallus also wrote a letter, {{which gave him}} much trouble, {{to a friend of}} his, who was a brother officer with the army at Jerusalem, {{enclosing}} one to be handed to Marcus <b>if,</b> perchance, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have rejoined the Standards.|$|R
