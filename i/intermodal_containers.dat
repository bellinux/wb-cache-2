25|$|<b>Intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> {{which contain}} {{valuables}} {{can be the}} target of break-ins and burglary when left unattended. In these cases, the container may be fitted with a security system consisting of a motion detector and panel inside the container. The panel can trigger a siren, strobe, or light to deter intruders, or use a radio signal to alert security guards.|$|E

25|$|Swap body units {{usually have}} the same bottom corner {{fixtures}} as <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers,</b> and often have folding legs under their frame {{so that they can}} be moved between trucks without using a crane. However they frequently don't have the upper corner fittings of ISO containers, and are not stackable, nor can they be lifted and handled by the usual equipment like reach-stackers or straddle-carriers. They are generally more expensive to procure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> are {{not strong}} enough for {{conversion}} to underground bunkers without additional bracing, as the walls cannot sustain much lateral pressure and will collapse. Also, the wooden floor of many used containers could contain some fumigation residues, rendering them unsuitable as confined spaces, such as for prison cells or bunkers. Cleaning or replacing the wood floor can make these used containers habitable, with proper attention to such essential issues as ventilation and insulation.|$|E

25|$|Just like {{cardboard}} boxes and pallets, these containers are {{a means to}} bundle cargo and goods into larger, unitized loads, {{that can be easily}} handled, moved, and stacked, and that will pack tightly in a ship or yard. <b>Intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> share a number of key construction features to withstand the stresses of intermodal shipping, to facilitate their handling and to allow stacking, as well as being identifiable through their individual, unique ISO 6346 reporting mark.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> {{in the world of}} varying types to suit {{different}} cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined unit load device is used.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} where the railway loading gauge is sufficient, truck trailers are often carried by rail. Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads. A container called a tanktainer, with a tank inside a standard container frame, carries liquids. Refrigerated containers (reefer) are used for perishables. Swap body units have the same bottom corners as <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> but are {{not strong enough to}} be stacked. They have folding legs under their frame and can be moved between trucks without using a crane.|$|E
25|$|An {{intermodal}} container {{is a large}} standardized shipping container, designed and built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading their cargo. <b>Intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> are primarily used to store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global containerized intermodal freight transport system, but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight container, ISO container, shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex) box, sea or c can.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{shipment}} of CONEXes, containing engineering supplies and spare parts, {{was made by}} rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the Port of San Francisco, then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea, in late 1952; shipment times were almost halved. By {{the time of the}} Vietnam War the majority of supplies and materials were shipped by CONEX. By 1965 the US military used some 100,000 Conex boxes, and more than 200,000 in 1967. making this the first worldwide application of <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers.</b> After the US Department of Defense standardized an 8-foot by 8-foot cross section container in multiples of 10-foot lengths for military use, it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.|$|E

25|$|North American railroads {{operated}} 1,471,736 {{freight cars}} and 31,875 locomotives, with 215,985 employees. They originated 39.53 million carloads (averaging 63 tons each) and generated $81.7 billion in freight revenue of present 2014. The average haul was 917 miles. The largest (Class 1) U.S. railroads carried 10.17 million <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> and 1.72 million piggyback trailers. Intermodal traffic was 6.2% of tonnage originated and 12.6% of revenue. The largest commodities were coal, chemicals, farm products, nonmetallic minerals and intermodal. Other major commodities carried include lumber, automobiles, and waste materials. Coal alone was 43.3% of tonnage and 24.7% of revenue. Coal accounted for {{roughly half of}} U.S. electricity generation and was a major export. As natural gas became cheaper than coal, coal supplies dropped 11% in 2015 but coal rail freight dropped by up to 40%, allowing an increase in car transport by rail, some in tri-level railcars.|$|E
25|$|ExpressRail is {{rail network}} {{supporting}} intermodal freight transport {{at the major}} container terminals of the port. The development of dockside trackage and railyards for transloading has been overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which works in partnership other public and private stakeholders. Various switching and terminal railroads, including the Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) on the Chemical Coast Secondary connect to the East Coast rail freight network carriers Norfolk Southern (NS), CSX Transportation (CSX), and Canadian Pacific (CP). In the year period ending October 2014 {{the total amount of}} TEUs of <b>Intermodal</b> <b>containers</b> handled at the port included 391,596 rail lifts. As of 2014, three ExpressRail systems (Newark, Elizabeth, and Staten Island) were in operation. Construction of a fourth, with connection to the National Docks Secondary, is underway at Port Jersey. Financed by a surcharge on all containers passing through the port by train or truck and the system in 2014 handled just over 14% of total container volume.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the port}} {{facilities}} {{needed to support}} containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports {{and the rise of}} others. At the Port of San Francisco, the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring port of Oakland emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the ports of Manhattan and New Jersey. In the United Kingdom, the Port of London and Port of Liverpool declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's Port of Felixstowe and Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, inland ports on waterways incapable of deep-draft ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of seaports. With <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers,</b> the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Substation Curaçao {{purchased}} Chapman {{to refurbish}} her and modify her {{for use as}} a seagoing mothership for the deep-diving scientific and tourist submarine Curasub. Modifications involved the installation of amenities for embarked scientists and tourists and of a 110-ton knuckle boom crane on Chapmans after deck to launch and retrieve both the submarine and its floating dock, both of which can be carried on Chapmans after deck. During submarine operations, the floating dock is lowered over the side and secured to Chapman so that Curasubs passengers have an easy and convenient way to embark on and disembark from the submarine without the danger of launching Curasub into the water with them already aboard; Curasub also is lowered over the side and operates from the floating dock, which includes a docking cradle for the submarine. Chapmans redesign also made provision for the temporary installation of two 20-foot (6.1-meter) <b>intermodal</b> <b>containers,</b> one configured {{for use as a}} wet laboratory and the other for use as a dry laboratiory, which can be carried on her deck when needed for the support of embarked scientists and stored ashore during tourist use of Curasub.|$|E
