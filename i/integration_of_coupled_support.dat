40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a two-paper {{investigation of}} observed naturalistic marital support {{behavior in a}} sample of 30 dual-earner middle-class couples with school-aged children who were videotaped in their homes over 4 days (two weekdays, two weekend days). Couples also self-reported on marital satisfaction, job stress, and emotional distress, as well as provided salivary cortisol samples that permitted analysis of diurnal cortisol slopes. Study 1 entails the conceptualization, development, and implementation of a novel observational coding system for naturalistic marital support behavior that provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis <b>of</b> <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> interactions as they unfold in everyday contexts. Analyses indicate that support interactions were relatively rare, predominantly brief (< 30 seconds long), more often solicited than offered, mostly instrumental compared to emotional in content, and overwhelmingly positive versus negative in emotional quality. In addition, patterns were examined among the different support variables; in particular, findings counter the Support Gap Hypothesis and suggest that wives receive more support than husbands, due specifically to wives soliciting more support. Study 2 examines the predictors and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior using the self-reported individual variables and diurnal cortisol slopes. Findings support the notion that emotional distress and job stress predict the support behavior of both spouses. Interesting sex differences emerged, whereby wives' depressive symptoms, wives' job stress, and husbands' neuroticism appeared to have the strongest influence on supportive behavior. However, analyses indicate little evidence for <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior as a predictor of marital satisfaction and diurnal cortisol slopes.

25|$|Spontaneous {{fluctuations}} in global climate might explain past variability. It {{is very difficult}} to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be since other forcings, as noted above, exist whose magnitude may not be known either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long <b>integrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupled</b> ocean-atmosphere global climate models. They have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. The variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two. Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.|$|R

Without such information it is impossible to say that current climate change is different or unique from changes that have happened in the past and, therefore, potentially due to man-induced causes. We have estimated {{the spectrum}} of natural variability from a globally distributed set of palaeo-temperature proxies and compared it with comparable estimates from two long control <b>integrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupled</b> general circulation models- the type used to predict anthropogenic change due to greenhouse gases. None of the three estimates of the natural variability spectrum agree with each other on the low-frequency, near-global time/space scales.

40|$|Realistic {{representation}} of sea ice in ocean models {{involves the use}} of a non-linear free-surface, a real freshwater flux and observance of requisite conservation laws. We show here that these properties can be achieved in practice through use of a rescaled vertical coordinate ‘‘z*” in z-coordinate models that allows one to follow undulations in the free-surface under sea ice loading. In particular, the adoption of "z*" avoids the difficult issue of vanishing levels under thick ice. Details of the implementation within MITgcm are provided. A high resolution global ocean sea ice simulation illustrates the robustness of the z* formulation and reveals a source of oceanic variability associated with sea ice dynamics and ice-loading effects.
