He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools to triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E

50|$|The third {{volume in}} Wilson’s Cosmic Trigger series {{begins with an}} {{analysis}} of a <b>faked</b> internet <b>news</b> story announcing the author’s death, in February 1994. Wilson discusses this with his usual humor, and then uses it as a springboard into philosophical meditation on broader issues relating {{to the nature of}} ‘truth’ and existential questions about death and reality. Indeed, much of the book is concerned with the mutability of reality; the different layers or ‘masks’ of experience, in a Nietzschean sense. Wilson uses the example of Elmyr, the art forger, to explore issues such as authenticity and consensus reality. Another key figure throughout is Orson Welles. Wilson comments on the techniques Welles used in his films, relating their effects to the relativistic conceptualization of reality that Wilson associates with the use of marijuana.|$|R
25|$|In the Harry Potter books, the Ministry's {{employees}} {{appear to}} be a largely unelected body. The post of Minister itself, however, is stated to be an elected position. Who has the power to elect or dismiss ministers is never explained. Nevertheless, both the Minister and the Ministry as a whole are seen throughout the Harry Potter series to be highly sensitive to (and reliant on) wizard public opinion, which they attempt to influence via wizarding newspapers. The most functional newspaper is the Daily Prophet, which gives reliable information about politItaly knowledge, and advertisements. Another reliable news source is Witch Weekly, although it focuses less on politics and prison trials than celebrities and advertisements and Quidditch Season. A less than reliable source is the Quibbler, which gives no advertisements, and focuses on <b>fake</b> <b>news,</b> for instance, saying that a star Quid ditch player didn't break his leg, but was bitten by a creature most people have never heard of. In the books, employment with the Ministry can be obtained right after completion of a wizarding education, though different offices require different levels of education and sometimes specific exam results.|$|E

5000|$|A British South Africa Company {{policeman}} called Mhasvi, of the Nyandoro clan of Harava, deserted the British to {{join the}} rebellion at Mazoe. He was made commander {{of the army and}} trained the Hwata men on how to shoot with guns. Mambo Hwata gave orders to cut telephone lines and gave his men letters to take to all British families in the area, with the instruction that the men should attack and kill all British men who came out to receive the <b>fake</b> letters. This <b>news</b> reached the British families in the area and they sought refuge at Mazoe Mine. An initial army of 20 villagers attacked a British convoy of 6 British men (Faull, Cass, Dickensen, Pascoe, Fairbairn and Stoddart) who had left Mazoe mine driving a donkey cart towards Salisbury. They had left their wives at Mazoe Mine. The villagers shot and killed Cass, followed by one Dickenson. Shortly after, the Hwata soldiers attempted to ambush the remaining four British men by pretending to be friendly Mashona. The four became suspicious of their knobkerries, and started to open fire. The donkey kart was hastily turned around, with one Pascoe and Faull scrambled in front, and a Fairbairn and Stobbart following behind. After travelling a hundred yards, the Hwata shot at Faull, and his body slumped to the ground. Fairbairn returned fire and killed a Hwata youth. There was exchange of fire between the Hwata villagers and the remaining two British men, who fled to the mine after Fairbairn's gun jammed. Meanwhile, Blakiston, Darling, Spreckley and Hendrik who had remained at the mine decided to accompany the three women on a wagonnette to Salisbury. They were attacked by fifty armed villagers, and they immediately returned unharmed to the mine. Later, Blakiston persuaded Routledge to accompany him to the grass thatched hut to send a rescue telegraph to Salisbury. They managed to send a message that read: [...] "We are surrounded. Dickensen, Cass, Faull killed ... for God's sake ..." [...] and [...] "We are surrounded, send us help, this is our only chance. Goodbye". Blakiston, standing {{in the doorway of the}} pole and dagga hut scanning the grass and bush, shouted as he saw the villagers swarming their line of retreat. Off they set, with Routledge on the saddle and Blakiston running at his side. Bullets whistled round their heads as the natives swarmed towards their line of retreat, but they managed to cover half the journey in safety until they were in full view of their colleagues at the mine. Suddenly the horse was seen to fall and Routledge was thrown to the ground; he rose and made for cover, but was shot. Blakiston gained cover of the bush hotly pursued by the villagers; shots were heard, and Blakiston was never seen again. Six British men had been killed at Mazoe in a day.|$|R

40|$|Search the web for today’s {{business}} news or read the business {{section of the}} newspaper and you will likely come across a headline about a company facing a public relations (i. e., PR) crisis. Take the recent headline “Edelman Eats Humble Pie, Unmasked as Force behind Wal-Mart Blog; PR Giant Does Damage Control” in Advertising Age (2006). The accompanying article and photo of Richard Edelman contains an apology by him for a fake blog that his firm created on behalf of Wal-Mart. The question we address is how consumers will respond to Edelman’s public apology for the “error in failing to be transparent about {{the identity of the}} two bloggers from the outset. ” How will Edelman’s apology impact consumer liking for the Edelman and Wal-Mart brands? We believe that Edelman’s photo in the news article, specifically whether he is perceived to have a “babyface” (large eyes, small nose, high forehead, and small chin) or a mature face {{will be one of the}} determinants of their response. Appearances bias impressions. Is the person attractive? Are they tall? Do they have a babyface? Babyfaced people are perceived as kinder, warmer, and physically weaker than mature-faced people (Berry and McArthur 1985). They are also perceived as more honest and more naïve (Berry and Brownlow 1989). The focus of most of the babyface research has been on trait inferences and not on the downstream consequences of these inferences, such as evaluations and judgments (Zebrowitz 1997). Also prior research has not systematically investigated the boundary conditions for this effect and it is not clear whether these inferences are spontaneous and correctible in the face of competing contextual cues. Our research contributes to the literature by addressing these gaps. We examine a situation where a company has a product-related PR crisis- their cough remedy that turns out to have side effects. The crisis results in adverse publicity-a news report of the crisis containing a photograph of the CEO. A question that is likely to be raised in the reader’s mind when reading the report is whether the company knew about the problem beforehand but did not acknowledge it publicly. One cue that might be used to answer this question is the face of the CEO and how honest it looks. Based on the literature, we expect that a babyfaced (vs. maturefaced) CEO will be seen as more honest, with attitudes towards their company more favorable as a result. If consumers are however alerted to other cues in the situation that are more diagnostic regarding intentionality, appearance-based inferences should be corrected. One situational cue is the severity of the crisis. If the crisis is severe, the inference that the babyfaced CEO did not intentionally mislead consumers is likely to be “corrected,” if they have the cognitive resources to make the correction. Attitudes towards the company should be negative regardless of the shape of the CEO’s face. Another gap in the literature concerns the previously mentioned lack of examination of the effect of face-trait associations on downstream judgments. We address this gap experimentally through the prior priming of either associations consistent with the babyface stereotype or counter to it. We also address it by creating situations in which innocence has negative versus positive implications. We take the same construct of innocence and the associations related to it to show how in a public relations crisis, perceptions of innocence arising from babyfaceness can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. In our first experiment, we manipulated the face shape of CEO, cognitive capacity and crisis severity. Participants were asked to read a <b>fake</b> Yahoo <b>news</b> article about the pharmaceutical company whose new product has been found to have side effects. The article featured a photo of the CEO morphed into either a babyfaced or maturefaced photo. As expected, babyfaceness influenced perceived honesty of the CEO, which in turn influenced company attitudes, except when many users suffered the side effect (extreme crisis). However, if cognitive capacity was limited, babyfaceness had a significant effect even in a high crisis situation. Hence babyface-honesty inferences appear to be spontaneous, which are corrected when sufficient cognitive resources are available. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that the natural association between babyfaceness and honesty/unintentional wrongdoing underlies inferences about perceived honesty and persuasion. The natural association between babyfaceness and unintentional wrongdoing was reversed by creating associations between babyfaceness and intentional harm through a priming task prior to exposure to the Yahoo article. As a result, the mature-faced CEO was perceived as more honest with company attitudes more favorable. Experiment 3 showed that the association of babyfaceness and innocence has negative consequences if innocence implies naiveté. We constructed a situation in which a company recovering from a PR crisis is searching for a new CEO. The PR crisis was either due to a former CEO’s dishonesty or his lack of vigilance. A mature-faced CEO was viewed as a better choice to lead the company than a babyfaced CEO in the vigilance-in-doubt situation whereas a babyfaced CEO was viewed as a better choice than the mature-faced CEO in the honesty-in-doubt scenario. These results provided further evidence that the traits associated with babyfaceness are used in downstream judgments. In sum, our research suggests that in PR crises, the face of the company definitely matters in most cases. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
