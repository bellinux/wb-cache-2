40|$|The deceased-donor kidney {{allocation}} system {{suffers from}} a severe shortage of available organs. At the same time, there is significant variation in {{the threshold of the}} lowest quality organs procured across different geographies in the United States. A deceased-donor organ is procured if there is the “intent ” of transplanting it. An empirical analysis of the donor and recipient data at the <b>Donor</b> <b>Service</b> Area level reveals that the intent increases significantly with organ quality and the median waiting time for a transplant. In particular, it shows that lower quality organs are likely to be procured at a higher rate in DSAs with longer waiting times. A counterfactual study, motivated by a proposed policy change to the kidney allocation system, shows that broader sharing of the bottom 15 % quality kidneys leads to stronger intent for the organ and an increase in the procurement rates of those organs, thus increasing the supply of procured organs available for transplantation. In particular, the regional sharing of those organs leads to an expected 58 additional procured kidneys per year whereas the national sharing results in an expected 129 additional deceased-donor kidneys per year...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dengue is {{an urban}} {{arbovirus}} whose etiologic agent is a virus {{of the genus}} Flavorius with four distinct antigen serotypes (DENV- 1, DENV- 2, DENV- 3 and DENV- 4) that is transmitted to humans through the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The Campo Mourão region in Brazil is endemic for dengue fever. OBTECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies specific to the four serotypes of dengue in donors of the blood <b>donor</b> <b>service</b> in the city of Campo Mourão. METHODS: Epidemiological records were evaluated and 4 mL of peripheral blood from 213 blood donors were collected in tubes without anticoagulant. Serum was then obtained and immunochromatographic tests were undertaken (Imuno-Rápido Dengue IgM/IgG TM). Individuals involved in the study answered a social and epidemiological questionnaire on data which included age, gender and diagnosis of dengue. RESULTS: Only three (1. 4 %) of the 213 blood tests were positive for IgG anti-dengue antibodies. No donors with IgM antibody, which identifies acute infection, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current analysis show that the introduction of quantitative or molecular serological methods to determine the presence of anti-dengue antibodies or the detection of the dengue virus in blood donors in endemic regions should be established so that the quality of blood transfusions is guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|The {{models of}} {{community}} foundations today vary almost as widely as the {{communities in which}} they're based. While many organizations remain focused on traditional activities like endowment management, <b>donor</b> <b>service,</b> and grantmaking, other community foundations have begun to experiment with new opportunities for serving their communities, from financing social impact bonds to facilitating community dialogue. Yet despite a growing record of innovation, the prevailing narrative of the community foundation field has remained largely unchanged as the model hits its centennial anniversary. Instead of a story of adaptation and diversity, the field is still viewed {{as if it had}} a single, uniform model [...] acting as a charitable bank for their communities [...] that no longer really represents the heart of what many community foundations do. This dated narrative is beginning to hold community foundations back. It prevents outsiders from seeing the vibrancy and innovation going on in the field, and it pushes many community philanthropy organizations to retrench defensively in the face of new competitive challenges {{at a time when they}} would be better off opening themselves up to new ideas and new ways of serving their communities. The Monitor Institute's What's Next for Community Philanthropy initiative aims to shift this narrative, and to help the community foundation field enter its second century on its front foot.

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} assess the impact of wait times on patient {{survival}} following liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a single <b>donor</b> <b>service</b> area. Patients and methods. Patients listed in the New England Organ Bank (NEOB) from 1996 to 2005 for liver transplantation with a diagnosis of HCC were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. The following data were extracted: date of listing, date removed from the wait list, indication for wait list removal, patient death and date of last known follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated from the time of listing for transplant (intention to treat liver transplant survival, ITT OLT) and compared to those calculated from the date of transplant (liver transplant, OLT). Results. There were 63 new registrations to the transplant list during the study period. Sixty-one patients were removed from the waiting list: transplanted 41 (65 %), death seven (11 %), candidate condition deteriorated/too sick to transplant eight (13 %), medically unsuitable one (2 %), other one (2 %), transferred to another center two (3 %), and transplanted at another center one (2 %). Three-year survival following liver transplantation for primary liver cancer was 85 %. When the results were analyzed using an intention to treat analysis there was a 10 – 20 % decrease in survival rate at every time point due to wait list drop-out. Conclusion. Wait list drop-out adversely affects liver transplant survival in transplant centers served by the NEOB. These data should be considered when recommending transplant versus resection as first line therapy for stage I or II HCC in our region...|$|E
40|$|Infl uenza viruses, {{including}} highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1), {{could threaten}} blood safety. We analyzed 10, 272 blood donor samples with a minipool nucleic acid amplication technique. Analytical {{sensitivity of the}} method was 804 geq/mL and 444 geq/mL for generic infl uenza primers and infl uenza (H 5 N 1) subtype–specifi c primers. This study demonstrates that such screening for infl uenza viruses is feasible. In the 20 th century, 3 influenza-related pandemics occurred (1918 Spanish influenza, 1957 Asian influenza, and 1968 Hong Kong influenza) (1), which are now known to represent 3 different antigenic subtypes of the influenza A virus: H 1 N 1, H 2 N 2, and H 3 N 2. Major influenza epidemics show neither periodicity nor a predictable pattern, and all differ from one another. Evidence suggests that true pandemics involving changes in hemagglutinin subtypes are caused by genetic reassortment in animal influenza A viruses. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has reported the infection of ≈ 218 persons and 124 deaths (56. 9 %; as of May 23, 2006) caused by the (H 5 N 1) subtype in 10 different countries; a probable person-to-person transmission of the avian influenza virus was suggested (2). Most countries predicted death rates of 14 – 1, 685 persons per 100, 000 population {{in the event of}} a pandemic and estimated that up to 2, 707 persons per 100, 000 population would become infected (3). Our study demonstrates that screening donor blood for influenza A (H 5 N 1) subtype or for influenza viruses in general by minipool nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT) is feasible. To ensure the safety of blood products, this screening technique could be introduced into the blood-screening procedure without delay in the case of a pandemic. The Study To increase blood safety, we introduced minipool NAT screening in our blood <b>donor</b> <b>service</b> in 1997 for hepatiti...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we wonder}} whether the {{implementation}} of agricultural advisory services (AAS) at grassroots level {{was influenced by the}} state, <b>donors,</b> <b>service</b> providers or rather by farmers. We selected three non government organizations, one farmer organisation and one public organisation providing services under different financing arrangements. We found that donors highly influenced the implementation of services. Operational providers had some degree of freedom for adapting services. Consequently, different providers under the same contractual arrangements could use different strategies to meet farmers' needs. Farmers had less influence on the implementation of AAS. Much is still to be done for a real farmer-led AAS. (Résumé d’auteur...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{work environments}} are {{characterized}} by growing demands for accountability and complex performance expectations from stakeholders. It is particularly true for fast developing nonprofit sectors of which civil society organizations (CSOs) are not only accountable to the public sector but also <b>donors,</b> <b>service</b> users and members. While CSOs often have strong leaders who are passionate, entrepreneurial and charismatic, {{they also tend to}} be undermanaged and understaffed. Roles and performance expectations are not clearly specified due to the competing values and priorities of multiple stakeholders. As a result, CSOs‘ workers often find themselves exhausted by repeated reinvention of work processes and confused by competing values in the work. They are susceptible to job burnout characterized by exhaustion and cynicism. Is leadership ready to meet the challenge of accountability explosion and help workers chart a course through complex and contradictory institutional environments?
