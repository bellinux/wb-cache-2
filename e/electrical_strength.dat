40|$|Pulsed {{electrical}} field (PEF) {{technology offers}} {{an alternative to}} thermal pasteurisation of high-acid fruit juices, by extending the shelf life of food products, while retaining its fresh taste and nutritional value. Substantial research has been performed {{on the effect of}} <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> on the inactivation kinetics of spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms and on the outgrowth of spoilage micro-organisms during shelf life. However, studies on the effect of <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> on the inactivation and outgrowth of surviving populations during shelf life are missing. In this study, we assessed the influence of <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> applied by PEF processing and storage temperature on the outgrowth of surviving yeast and mould populations naturally present in fresh fruit smoothie in time. Therefore, an apple-strawberry-banana smoothie was treated in a continuous-flow PEF system (130 L/h), using similar inlet and outlet conditions (preheating temperature 41 °C, maximum temperature 58 °C) to assure that the amount of energy across the different conditions was kept constant. Smoothies treated with variable <b>electrical</b> field <b>strengths</b> (13. 5, 17. 0, 20. 0 and 24. 0 kV/cm) were compared to smoothies without treatment for outgrowth of yeasts and moulds. Outgrowth of yeasts and moulds stored at 4 °C and 7 °C was analysed by plating and visual observation and yeast growth was modelled using the modified logistic growth model (Zwietering model). Results showed that the intensity of the <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> had an influence on the degree of inactivation of yeast cells, resulting in a faster outgrowth over time at lower <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength.</b> Outgrowth of moulds over time was not affected by the intensity of the <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> used. Application of PEF introduces a trade-off between type of spoilage: in untreated smoothie yeasts lead to spoilage after 8 days when stored at 4 or 7 °C, whereas in PEF treated smoothie yeasts were (partly) inactivated and provided outgrowth opportunities for moulds, which led to spoilage by moulds after 14 days (7 °C) or 18 days (4 °C). </p...|$|R

For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet. The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested.

This study was planned {{to evaluate the}} effects of different <b>electrical</b> field <b>strengths</b> with 950 MHz waves of the GSM mobile phone system on the excitatory postsynaptic potentiation (EPSP) slope of the dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP). Material and Methods: Twenty four naive male Wistar rats (3 months old, weighing 220 + 15 g) were randomly divided into three groups (sham–exposed, GSM with 50. 4 V/m and GSM with 60 V/m <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength).</b> The exposure program was carried out for 10 sessions during 3 days.

40|$|Living {{organisms are}} known to be {{affected}} by “electrosmogs” which refers to the electrical and magnetic fields in the earth. These fields are said to have a bad impact on the human health yet their effect on the other living organisms like plants is not taken into account. Even if the presence of the studies on the magnetic fields' effect to the plants cannot be denied, there is no systematic study on the electrical field effect to the plants' photosynthesis rate. Seeing this absence, this essay is centered on the effect of varying <b>electrical</b> field’s <b>strength</b> on Elodea canadensis. E. canadensis is chosen because it is a common plant that can be found in many aquatic ecosystems, an important source of O 2 for the water ecosystem and an indispensable part of the primary production of the ecosystem. In order to answer the research question, a fixed number of elodea was subjected to the different <b>electrical</b> field <b>strengths,</b> and the dissolved O 2 concentration in the water was measured with data loggers {{in order to determine the}} photosynthesis rate. At the end of the experiment, when the results were analyzed by using ANOVA, it is found that as the <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength</b> increased, the dissolved O 2 concentration didn't change significantly indicating the rate of photosynthesis is not affected by the increase in the <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength.</b> Thus, the analysis of the data does not support the hypothesis. However when the means of the experimental groups photosynthesis rates are compared to the control group' s, it can be said that if Elodea Canadensis was exposed to higher <b>electrical</b> field <b>strength,</b> then a obvious change would be observed. The hypothesis might not supported due to some systematic and random errors or simply because of inadequacy of the <b>strength</b> of the <b>electrical</b> field that could not interfere with the photosynthesis procedure...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of electron capture of traps in solid dielectrics under high <b>electrical</b> <b>strength</b> were studied with the surface potential measurement by the authors. A first-order dynamic equation of trapping was derived {{by considering the}} detrapping of electrons caused by collision ionization. The theory can qualitatively explain the time characteristic of trapped electrons and the reduction of steady-state values of trapped electrons with <b>electrical</b> <b>strength</b> increasing. The test results confirmed the theoretical analysis. It was shown that the decreasing of the steady-state value was caused by detrapping due to electron collision ionization between the free electrons and the trapped ones rather than by tunnel effect or Poole-Frenkel effect of trapped electrons as usually thought.

40|$|Structure-property {{relationships}} in binary polyethylene blends, {{and how they}} relate to <b>electrical</b> <b>strength,</b> have been investigated by various analytical steps. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy {{have been used to}} characterise in detail the microstructure of blends composed of linear (LPE) and branched (BPE) polyethylene, these have shown a general increase in the size of isothermally crystallised spherulites with increasing LPE content. On increasing the crystallisation temperature, spherulites became more compact and better separated, whereas on quenching, a morphology essentially independent of LPE content was obtained. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a two phase system whose composition did not depend on LPE content. Electrical testing using an AC ramped voltage, between parallel ball bearing electrodes, was employed to characterise the electrical insulation strength of the materials. Morphological, rather than molecular factors, were found to be key at influencing the <b>electrical</b> <b>strength.</b> <b>Electrical</b> <b>strength</b> was also found to be highly sensitive to the testing procedure and sample geometry employed. From computer simulations {{it was found that the}} general patterns of tree growth depended on sample geometry, test conditions, and morphology, in a similar way to that found by experiment. The idea of dielectric failure due to a propagating damage structure is not inconsistent with the simulated or experimental data. A variety of blend systems were also subjected to mechanical tensile deformation and it was found that the morphology was affected significantly, even for small deformations within the elastic limit. Consequently, the <b>electrical</b> <b>strength</b> was reduced by mechanical tensile strain.
