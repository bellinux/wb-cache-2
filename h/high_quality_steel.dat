5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. <b>High</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 500 BC, {{although}} certainly by 200 AD, <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> was produced in southern India by the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. Iron chain was used in Indian suspension bridges {{as early as}} the 4th century.|$|E
25|$|Khanda is a double-edge {{straight}} sword. It {{is often}} featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. Some communities venerate the weapon {{as a symbol}} of Shiva. It is a common weapon in the martial arts in the Indian subcontinent. Khanda often appears in Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b> This gave the blade a very hard cutting edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} issued public tenders {{for construction}} of the ships in June 1883, and on 3 July {{it was announced that}} John Roach & Sons had won all four contracts. Roach immediately went to work on construction of the ships, but continual design changes submitted by the Navy, in addition to shortages of the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> demanded by Navy inspectors, soon had construction falling well behind schedule. Roach found himself faced with mounting financial losses. A fire in the shipyard and the loss of two steamers in which Roach had part ownership depleted cash reserves still further.|$|E
25|$|The Arthashastra and the Edicts of Ashoka are {{the primary}} written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The Mauryan Empire {{was based on a}} modern and {{efficient}} economy and society. However, the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government. Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof. During this period, a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
5000|$|The bars {{were then}} shortened, bound, heated and forge welded {{together}} to become shear steel.It {{would be cut}} and re welded multiple times, with each new weld producing a more homogeneous, <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b> This would be done at most 3-4 times, as more is unnecessary and could potentially cause carbon loss from the steel.|$|R

50|$|Crankshafts {{can also}} be {{machined}} out of a billet, often a bar of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> vacuum remelted <b>steel.</b> Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn’t follow {{the shape of the}} crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steels,</b> which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.|$|R

50|$|In 1862 Swedish Göran Fredrik Göransson founded Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB, {{producing}} <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> {{using the}} Bessemer process. In 1866 company went into bankruptcy and was refunded as Sandviken Jernverks AB in 1868. With {{the new technology}} {{a number of new}} applications for steel wires were discovered, for instance it was perfect for producing fishing hooks. A fishing hook must be hard and strong but absolutely not brittle. In 1879 The Swedish national board of trade approved the use of the Fish and Hook trademark. Starting in 1886, Göran began the production of saw blades that were of that same <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b> The little fish surrounded by a hook that was registered as the official emblem of rolled steel for fishhooks was also used for the handsaws, to communicate these special properties and quality of the blades.

50|$|During the 20th Century, shells became {{increasingly}} streamlined. In World War I, ogives were typically two circular radius head (crh) - the curve was {{a segment of}} a circle having a radius of twice the shell calibre. After that war, ogive shapes became more complex and elongated. From the 1960s, <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> were introduced by some countries for their HE shells, this enabled thinner shell walls with less weight of metal and hence a greater weight of explosive. Ogives were further elongated to improve their ballistic performance.|$|R
40|$|Obtaining <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> mainly {{depends on}} the {{quantity}} of non-metallic inclusions contained into it and this, in turn, {{to a large extent}} on the structure of the flow in the tundish. Optimization of the flow of liquid steel through the tundish makes it possible to control the trajectory of inclusions and thereby to improve the conditions of their outflow into the slag layer. The following article presents an analysis of research opportunities of the inclusions distribution and removing process from the steel flowing through the tundish, resulting in reconstruction of the own research facility...|$|R
40|$|Due to an ever {{increasing}} demand for cleaner, <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steels,</b> {{there is an}} increasing push for steelmakers to lower the non-metallic inclusion contents of the steel they produce. Understanding inclusion reactivity in steel is key in producing <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> at <b>high</b> production rates. Our current knowledge in controlling and predicting inclusion development during liquid steel processing is limited. In this study, spinel (MgAI 204) inclusions of close to stoichiometric MgO. AI 2 O 3 and known size distribution where added to the liquid steel bath prior to assessing their reactivity. The pO 2 of the gas phase was controlled to 10 - 13 atm throughout the experiemnt. The inclusions were then tracked for changes in size morphology and composition with time in an aluminium killed steel at 1600 degrees celcius. It {{was found that the}} inclusions were evenly distributed through the melt. There was little change in the average size of the spinel inclusioins during the reaction. However, the composition of the inclusions did change. It was found that the Mg: AI mass percentage ratio of the inclusions changed immediately from ~ 0. 5 to 0. 08. Other inclusions found in the melt were alumina and complex sulphide inclusions. Of these {{it was found that the}} proportion of the alumina inclusioin increased with time...|$|R

5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the first ocean-going battleships built for the German navy, and marked the {{beginning}} of German naval expansion. Previous classes included several types of ironclad ships, including coastal defense ships and armored frigates. The ships were unique for the time in that they were armed with six large-caliber guns instead of four, as was standard on contemporary ships in other navies. The class comprised four ships: Brandenburg, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, Weissenburg, and Wörth. Of the four ships, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg were more advanced, in that their armor was composed of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pattern welding {{fell out}} of use in the 9th century, as <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> became available.
