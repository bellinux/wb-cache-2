50|$|A sabiki or flasher rig is {{typically}} fished off boats, piers, jetties, or any structure over the water. Sabikis consist of any number (usually between 6 and 10) of small hooks, each one on individual dropper lines {{which are a}} few inches long. The individual dropper lines are then tied to a longer leader in series, about 6 in apart; a weight {{is tied to the}} end of the leader. The individual hooks are decorated as lures or tied like flies similar to those used in fly fishing. Often they have a simple piece lumo infused material or <b>iridescent</b> <b>film</b> attached to them. Traditionally, on any individual rig all of the lures will be either identical or in an alternating sequence of colors. The type or size sabiki used depends on water conditions, species of fish sought or simply the angler's preference.|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} Szpilman {{explored}} the hospital thoroughly. It {{was full of}} items the Germans intended to take with them, meaning {{he would have to}} be careful travelling around the building in case a group should arrive to loot. To avoid the patrols that occasionally swept the building, Szpilman hid in a lumber room, tucked in a remote corner of the hospital. Food and drink were scarce in the hospital, and for the first four or five days of his stay in the building, Szpilman was unable to find anything. When, again, he went searching for food and drink, Szpilman managed to find some crusts of bread and a fire bucket full of water. The stinking water was covered in an <b>iridescent</b> <b>film,</b> but Szpilman drank deeply, although he stopped after inadvertently swallowing a considerable amount of dead insects.|$|E
5000|$|Córdova {{was taught}} {{the art of}} the curare extract by Izidoro, who called it [...] "winged death". Izidoro was chief of the Jaguar clan of the Tikuna tribe. He and Córdova agreed to share their herbal knowledge, he about curare, Córdoba about ayahuasca. Regarding curare, it took several days to collect the source ampihuasca, [...] "a large woody vine that hangs down from the tree tops". Izidoro would climb up to a hundred feet to cut this four-inch thick vine, each plant being {{carefully}} scrutinized and it name voiced. Other ingredients for the brew were also taken, e.g., hot peppers, tobacco leaves, and scorpions. The vine was mashed and put with water in a pot, kept at a low simmer for several days, during which the liquid was filtered and skimmed. Incantations were required to guide the process. Its fumes were to be avoided. The brew became complete when an <b>iridescent</b> <b>film</b> formed on its surface.|$|E

Factory waste, as well as sewage produced by throngs of factory workers, was discharged directly into the river. One observer of the Mad River in 1887 noted that water downstream of Scovill Manufacturing Company, one of the foremost brass producers in Waterbury, [...] "showed extreme contamination; it was of a dark turbid color, with a strong odor and was covered with <b>iridescent</b> <b>films</b> of oily and greasy matters".|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{apparent}} retreat of ignis fatuus upon being approached might be explained simply by the agitation {{of the air}} by nearby moving objects, causing the gases to disperse. This was observed in the very detailed accounts of several close interactions with ignis fatuus published earlier in 1832 by Major Louis Blesson {{after a series of}} experiments in various localities where they were known to occur. Of note is his first encounter with ignis fatuus in a marshland between a deep valley in the forest of Gorbitz, Newmark, Germany. Blesson observed that the water was covered by an <b>iridescent</b> <b>film,</b> and during day-time, bubbles could be observed rising abundantly from certain areas. At night, Blesson observed bluish-purple flames in the same areas and concluded that it was connected to the rising gas. He spent several days investigating the phenomenon, finding to his dismay that the flames retreated every time he tried to approach them. He eventually succeeded and was able to confirm that the lights were indeed caused by ignited gas. The British scientist Charles Tomlinson in On Certain Low-Lying Meteors (1893) describes Blesson's experiments as thus: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{of cellulose}} nanocrystals {{is a powerful}} method for the fabrication of biosourced photonic films with a chiral optical response. While various techniques have been exploited to tune the optical properties of such systems, the presence of external fields {{has yet to be}} reported to significantly modify their optical properties. In this work, by using small commercial magnets (≈ 0. 5 - 1. 2 T) the orientation of the cholesteric domains is enabled to tune in suspension as they assemble into films. A detailed analysis of these films shows an unprecedented control of their angular response. This simple and yet powerful technique unlocks new possibilities in designing the visual appearance of such <b>iridescent</b> <b>films,</b> ranging from metallic to pixelated or matt textures, paving the way for the development of truly sustainable photonic pigments in coatings, cosmetics, and security labeling.

40|$|Cellulose nanocrystals, {{rod-like}} crystalline nanoparticles, are a bio-based {{material that}} can be a great alternative to obtain films with tunable optical properties. Iridescent and light diffracting films can readily be obtained via the drying of a suspension of these cellulose nanocrystals. The characteristics of the particle deposition process together with the self-assembly in the precluding suspension has a direct effect on the optical properties of the obtained films. Particle deposition onto a substrate is affected by the flow dynamics inside sessile droplets and usually yields a ring-shaped deposition pattern commonly referred to as the coffee-ring effect. We set out to measure and describe the drying kinetics under different conditions. We found that the Marangoni flow inside the droplet was too small to counteract the capillary flow that deposits CNCs at the edges, resulting in the coffee-ring effect, irrespective of the atmospheric humidity. By varying the amount of ethanol in the atmosphere, we were able to find a balance between (1) colloidal stability in the droplet which is reduced due to ethanol diffusion into the droplet, and (2) increasing the Marangoni flow relative to capillary flow inside the droplet by changing the droplet surface tension. We could thus make <b>iridescent</b> <b>films</b> with a uniform thickness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and subsequent}} assembly of nearly spherical nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) {{particles in the}} presence of trace amounts of the polysaccharide chitosan was carried out employing a wet chemical approach. Chitosan addition during synthesis not only modulated HA crystallization but also aided in the assembly of nHA particles onto itself. Solvent extraction from these suspensions formed <b>iridescent</b> <b>films,</b> of which the bottom few layers were rich in self-assembled nHA particle arrays. The cross-section of these hybrid films revealed compositional and hence structural grading of the two phases and exhibited a unique morphology in which assembled nHA particles gradually gave way to chitosan-rich top layers. Transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction studies suggested that the basal plane of HA had interacted with chitosan, and scanning electron microscope studies of the hybrid films revealed multi-length scale hierarchical architecture composed of HA and chitosan. Phase identification was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld analysis of digitized XRD data showed that the basic apatite structure was preserved, but chitosan inclusion induced subtle changes to the HA unit cell. The refinement of crystallite shape using the Popa method clearly indicated a distinct change in the growth direction of HA crystallites from [001] to [100] with increasing chitosan concentration. The paper also discusses the likelihood of chitosan phosphorylation during synthesis, which we believe to be a pathway, by which chitosan molecules chemically interact with calcium phosphate precursor compounds and orchestrate the crystallization of nHA particles. Additionally, the paper suggests several interesting biomedical applications for graded nHA–chitosan nanostructured films...|$|R

The bog environment is acidic, {{with a low}} concentration of dissolved oxygen. In the acidic environment of the bog, a chemical reaction forms insoluble iron compounds which precipitate out.

40|$|The cholesteric {{liquid crystal}} {{self-assembly}} of water-suspended cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) into a helical arrangement was observed already more than 20 {{years ago and}} the phenomenon was used to produce <b>iridescent</b> solid <b>films</b> by evaporating the solvent or via sol-gel processing. Yet it remains challenging to produce optically uniform films and to control the pitch reproducibly, reflecting {{the complexity of the}} three-stage drying process that is followed in preparing the films. An equilibrium liquid crystal phase formation stage is followed by a non-equilibrium kinetic arrest, which in turn is followed by structural collapse as the remaining solvent is evaporated. Here we focus on the first of these stages, combining a set of systematic rheology and polarizing optics experiments with computer simulations to establish a detailed phase diagram of aqueous CNC suspensions with two different values of the surface charge, up to the concentration where kinetic arrest sets in. We also study the effect of varying ionic strength of the solvent. Within the cholesteric phase regime, we measure the equilibrium helical pitch {{as a function of the}} same parameters. We report a hitherto unnoticed change in character of the isotropic-cholesteric transition at increasing ionic strength, with a continuous weakening of the first-order character up to the point where phase coexistence is difficult to detect macroscopically due to substantial critical fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{polystyrene}} colloidal microspheres {{have been}} prepared using hexyl acrylate (HA), ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), isooctyl acrylate (IOA), butyl acrylate (BA), or isobutyl acrylate (IBA) as comonomers. Microspheres with diameters from 212 to 332 [*]nm and with a polystyrene content of 65 – 78 % were prepared. The particles prepared in this work do not present the typical core-shell structure; as a consequence, DSC analysis showed that the microspheres exhibited only one Tg. TEM images show that the particles with comonomer content below ~ 30 % were spherical and regular. Microspheres containing comonomer between 21 to 25 % produced the less brittle <b>films</b> showing very <b>iridescent</b> colors. The <b>films</b> prepared from microspheres containing hexyl, ethylhexyl, and isooctyl acrylate as comonomers are firmly attached to the substrate due to their adhesive properties.
