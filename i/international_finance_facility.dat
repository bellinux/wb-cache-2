40|$|Given Sub-Saharan Africa’s {{enormous}} resource {{needs for}} growth, poverty reduction, and other Millennium Development Goals, the development community has {{little choice but}} to continue to explore new sources of financing, innovative private-to-private sector solutions, and public-private partnerships to mobilize additional <b>international</b> <b>financing.</b> The paper suggests several new instruments for improving access to capital. An analysis of country creditworthiness suggests that many countries in the region may be more creditworthy than previously believed. Establishing sovereign rating benchmarks and credit enhancement through guarantee instruments provided by multilateral aid agencies would facilitate market access. Creative financial structuring, such as the <b>International</b> <b>Financing</b> <b>Facility</b> for Immunization, would help front-load aid commitments, although these may not result in additional financing in the long run. Preliminary estimates suggest that Sub-Saharan African countries can potentially raise $ 1 - 3 billion by reducing the cost of international migrant remittances, $ 5 - 10 billion by issuing diaspora bonds, and $ 17 billion by securitizing future remittances and other future receivables. African countries that have recently received debt relief however need to be cautious when resorting to market-based borrowing. This paper—a product of the Migration and Remittances Team of the Development Prospects Group—is part of a larger effort in the department to analyze innovative instruments that developing countries can utilize for mobilizing developmen...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} guided by the {{hypothesis}} {{that it is not}} exports per se that matter, but different export components influence growth differently. We considered a sample of 35 sub-Sahara African countries based on availability of data on the key variables. Aggregate data were obtained from the most recent World Bank‟s World Development Indicators and International Monetary Fund‟s <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> Statistics online <b>facilities.</b> Disaggregated data on exports and imports were obtained from the United Nation‟s Statistical Database under Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 4. The Generalized Methods of Moments estimator was employed during the analysis. We find that it is the growth in agricultural exports, and not manufactured exports, that is significantly associated with per capita income growth in our sample. These countries should adopt policies that increase agricultural exports in the medium term as they design strategies for increasing manufactured exports in the long term. Other factors significantly influencing growth are gross capital formation, capital goods imports, infrastructure, government consumption, and inflation rate, political systems and governance, and education...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In many {{countries}} worldwide, health worker shortages {{are one of}} the main constraints in achieving population health goals. Financial-incentive programmes for return of service, whereby participants receive payments in return for a commitment to practise {{for a period of time}} in a medically underserved area, can alleviate local and regional health worker shortages through a number of mechanisms. First, they can redirect the flow of those health workers who would have been educated without financial incentives from well-served to underserved areas. Second, they can add health workers to the pool of workers who would have been educated without financial incentives and place them in underserved areas. Third, financial-incentive programmes may improve the retention in underserved areas of those health workers who participate in a programme, but who would have worked in an underserved area without any financial incentives. Fourth, the programmes may increase the retention of all health workers in underserved areas by reducing the strength of some of the reasons why health workers leave such areas, including social isolation, lack of contact with colleagues, lack of support from medical specialists and heavy workload. We draw on studies of financial-incentive programmes and other initiatives with similar objectives to discuss seven management functions that are essential for the long-term success of financial-incentive programmes: financing (programmes may benefit from innovative donor financing schemes, such as endowment funds, <b>international</b> <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> or compensation payments); promotion (programmes should use tested communication channels in order to reach secondary school graduates and health workers); selection (programmes may use selection criteria to ensure programme success and to achieve supplementary policy goals); placement (programmes should match participants to areas in order to maximize participant satisfaction and retention); support (programmes should prepare participants for the time in an underserved area, stay in close contact with participants throughout the different phases of enrolment and help participants by assigning them mentors, establishing peer support systems or financing education courses relevant to work in underserved areas); enforcement (programmes may use community-based monitoring or outsource enforcement to existing institutions); and evaluation (in order to broaden the evidence on the effectiveness of financial incentives in increasing the health workforce in underserved areas, programmes in developing countries should evaluate their performance; in order to improve the strength of the evidence on the effectiveness of financial incentives, controlled experiments should be conducted where feasible). In comparison to other interventions to increase the supply of health workers to medically underserved areas, financial-incentive programmes have advantages – unlike initiatives using non-financial incentives, they establish legally enforceable commitments to work in underserved areas and, unlike compulsory service policies, they will not be opposed by health workers – as well as disadvantages – unlike initiatives using non-financial incentives, they may not improve the working and living conditions in underserved areas (which are important determinants of health workers' long-term retention) and, unlike compulsory service policies, they cannot guarantee that they will supply health workers to underserved areas who would not have worked in such areas without financial incentives. Financial incentives, non-financial incentives, and compulsory service are not mutually exclusive and may positively affect each other's performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} to the competitiveness of sustainable economic development is a country's global economic position. Small and medium industries, supposed to be drivers of economic development of a country, receive much of negative impact following the global economic uncertainty environment. This includes facing increasingly critical financial facilities. This study seeks to analyze the empirical relationship between small and medium industries and the <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in the short-run and long-run {{in the state of}} Sabah, Malaysia. The ARDL bound testing approach was applied, using annual time series data for the years between 1976 through 2005. The successes of small and medium industries have been related to availability of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results show that the relationships between small and medium industries and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> seem to exist in the long-run. In addition, there is a causal relation between small and medium industries and financial loan. The conclusion is that <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> {{may not be the most}} important factor in the development of small and medium scale industries, but small and medium industries on the other hand functions as the paramount important factor in the development of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> SMI, <b>Financing</b> <b>facilities,</b> ARDL, Sabah...|$|R

Such volume-neutral CTT tax would raise relatively little revenue though, estimated at around $33 bn annually, i.e., {{an order of magnitude}} less than the [...] "carbon tax which has by far the greatest revenue-raising potential, estimated at $130-750 bn annually."

50|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Facility</b> (IFF) first was {{proposed}} by HM Treasury {{in conjunction with the}} Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. An IFF is designed to frontload aid to help meet the Millennium Development Goals. Bonds are issued on global capital markets, against the security of government guarantees to maintain future aid flows, which would be used to buy back the bonds over a longer period. This allows a large amount of aid to flow soon, at the expense of less aid in the future. Critics have raised concerns that the poorest countries in particular don't have the ability to efficiently spend such large amounts of aid (whilst avoiding corruption), and that their economies {{may not be able to}} cope with such rapid change either.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 the United Nations {{agreed to}} achieve eight {{international}} development goals {{by the year}} 2015, called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Three of these goals are health related - to treat and fight life-threatening diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; to reduce childhood mortality; and to improve maternal health. Despite repeated commitments to the three health-related MDGs and increased funding available for development, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis still have appalling human and economic consequences in developing countries. Official Development Assistance has been increasing {{in the past few}} years but cannot keep up with the damage done by the economic crisis on low- and middle-income countries. In order to bridge this financing gap, the international community has looked into new funding mechanisms. The Taskforce on Innovative International Funding for Health Systems issued in June 2009 a report acknowledging the potential of innovative sources of funding: Innovative Financing projects that have sprouted up in the past decade include Product Red, the <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Facility</b> for Immunization, the Global Fund, the GAVI and UNITAID. UNITAID is funded by a small tax on airlines tickets levied in 12 countries and budgetary contributions from 17 countries. Since 2006, UNITAID has committed over US$730 million to support 16 projects in 93 countries.|$|E

But the IFF has also been shrouded in confusion and misconceptions. This paper explains the IFF proposal and highlights some of the common misunderstandings surrounding it, including the mechanics of the scheme itself, the potential for a U. S. role, and the expectations of aid which underlie the IFF’s premise. The UK deserves plaudits for elevating global poverty on the international agenda and for seeking ways to better harness the power of private capital markets for development. But the IFF, as currently conceived, is an idea that merits more scrutiny and a healthy dose of skepticism. development aid, <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Facility</b> (IFF), poverty, private capital market...|$|E
