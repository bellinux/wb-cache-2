40|$|In {{different}} countries, such as Ukraine and Sweden, {{there have}} been differences {{in the way of}} administrating the systems which dictate the way of living and the way the societies function. Different approaches have been adopted over the time when it came to setting up the rules for how the state´s vital organizations, such as tax administration, health care, police, army, education system and many others should work and function. The idea in many modern countries is the same, but the ways and procedures can differ a great deal from country to country. This applies to the sphere of district heating services as well. The purpose of this thesis is to gain understand with the help of economic theory why heating tariffs are managed in a country that has had transition from plan economy to market economy the way they are, and how the management of heating tariffs could be improved when taking into account the experience of a country with long established market economy. During field studies performed in Sweden and Ukraine, particularly in the city of Donetsk, a comparative analysis of the two <b>heating</b> <b>tariff</b> systems have been performed in order to outline and highlight the differences between them and to answer the main questions of the study. The results include the status report of the situation concerning the district <b>heating</b> <b>tariff</b> systems in Sweden and Ukraine, comparative analysis of the two systems and suggestion on improvements of the district <b>heating</b> <b>tariff</b> system in the city of Donetsk. The outcomes and suggested improvements do not provide the full picture and all the aspects of the situation, {{due to the fact that}} more extensive studies, involving larger resources, would have to be conducted in the area. However, the report provides a good starting point for further studies within the field of district heating tariffs in Ukraine and Sweden...|$|E
40|$|In Northern China, due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} of coal-fired cogeneration facilities, which are generally equipped with extraction-condensing steam turbines, lots of wind power resources may be wasted during the heating season. In contrast, considerable coal is consumed in the power generation sector. In this article, firstly it is revealed that there exists a serious divergence in the ratio of electrical to thermal energy between end users’ demand and the cogenerations’ production during off-peak load at night, which may negate active power-balancing of the electric power grid. Secondly, {{with respect to this}} divergence only occurring during off-peak load at night, a temporary proposal is given so as to enable the integration of more wind power. The authors suggest that if the energy carrier for part of the end users’ space heating is switched from heating water to electricity (e. g., electric heat pumps (EHPs) can provide space heating in the domestic sector), the ratio of electricity to heating water load should be adjusted to optimize the power dispatch between cogeneration units and wind turbines, resulting in fuel conservation. With this proposal, existing infrastructures are made full use of, and no additional ones are required. Finally a numerical simulation is performed in order to illustrate both the technical and economic feasibility of the aforementioned proposal, under ongoing infrastructures as well as electricity and space <b>heating</b> <b>tariff</b> conditions without changing participants’ benefits. The authors aim to persuade Chinese policy makers to enable EHPs to provide space heating to enable the integration of more wind power...|$|E

The results of the multi-criteria analysis are used to set the tariff benchmarks. The evaluation methodology has been tested for Latvian <b>heat</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and the obtained results show that only half of heating companies reach a benchmark value equal to 0. 5 for the efficiency closeness to the ideal solution indicator.

This contributes to even further development of renewable technologies. The balancing loop tries to prevent renewable technologies from being implemented thus slowing down the transition. The <b>heat</b> <b>tariff</b> is the element that determines whether the reinforcing or the balancing loop will be the stronger; it actually determines which way the DH system will develop—towards fossil technologies or towards 4 GDH system.|$|R

A case study is performed here in which a Swedish utility is analysed using three different methods for calculating the marginal costs of heat supply: a manual spreadsheet method, an optimising linear-programming model, and a least-cost dispatch simulation model. Calculated marginal-costs, obtained with the three methods, turn out to be similar. The calculated marginal-costs are also compared to the actual <b>heat</b> <b>tariff</b> in use by the utility.

30|$|Direct {{state support}} for energy sectors is not large in Ukraine {{compared}} to very high implicit subsidies due to under-pricing of energy products. Gas, electricity, and district <b>heating</b> <b>tariffs</b> for households are {{set by the}} state at very low rates, which do not reflect full costs for maintenance and capital investments (IEA [2006 b]). Underpricing of energy distorts the economy of Ukraine {{and is one of}} the most important factors of its persistently high energy-intensity. As of 2009, it was at the level of 0.40 Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES)/GDP (ppp) (toe per 1000 USD at 2000 prices) compared to 0.37 for non-OECD Europe and Eurasia and a world average of 0.19 TPES/GDP (ppp) (IEA [2011 a]). Energy consumption is also responsible for a large share of GHG emissions of the country. In particular, GHG emissions from fuel combustion amounted to 240.6 million tons CO 2 -eq., i.e., 57  % of the total country emissions in 2008 (MENR [2010]).|$|R
30|$|A system {{dynamics}} modeling approach {{was used to}} analyze the impact of economical mechanisms on CO 2 emissions from the Latvian district heating system that is not covered by the European Union (EU) Emission Trading System (non-ETS). Three policy instruments were included in the system dynamic model: carbon tax, subsidies for solar technologies, and funding for energy-efficient building renovations with the aim to decrease energy consumption. Eight development scenarios were examined, taking into account different policy mixes for the transition of the heat network to the low-temperature regime. The <b>heat</b> <b>tariff</b> was used as the main indicator to determine the pace and structure of the technology change. The existing natural gas technologies and three renewable energy technologies (biomass combustion equipment, heat pump, and solar collectors with accumulation) were included in the model. Modeling results show substantial CO 2 reduction potential; however, the results are highly dependent on the applied financial instruments. It is recommended to apply a policy mix, including all the proposed policy instruments—carbon tax, subsidies for solar technologies, and funding for energy-efficient renovation.|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) has {{the potential}} to support diversion of organic waste from landfill and increase renewable energy production. However, diffusion of this technology has been uneven, with countries such as Germany and Sweden taking the lead, but limited diffusion in other countries such as the UK. In this context, this study explores the financial viability of AD in the UK to offer reasons why it has not been more widely used. This paper presents a model that calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on a twenty year investment in a 30, 000 tonnes per annum wet mesophilic AD plant in the UK for the treatment of source separated organic waste, which is judged to be a suitable technology for the UK climate. The model evaluates the financial significance of the different alternative energy outputs from this AD plant and the resulting economic subsidies paid for renewable energy. Results show that renewable electricity and renewable heat sales supported by renewable electricity and renewable <b>heat</b> <b>tariffs</b> generates the greatest IRR (31. 26 %). All other uses of biogas generate an IRR in excess of 15 %, and are judged to be a financially viable investment.

40|$|The {{studies of}} {{environmental}} awareness or the so-called people's pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) became a popular topic in Europe, North America and Asia, {{but not yet}} in Russia. Many studies investigated PEBs revealed that monetary saving and health concern {{are considered to be}} the most common influential factors for many PEBs. Because of the lowest electric power and <b>heat</b> <b>tariffs</b> in the world as well as abundant natural resources it can be assumed that the level of environmental awareness in Russia is low comparing to EU. Nowadays this problem can became a barrier for innovative development and diffusion of new energy efficient technologies. In this paper we present the results of empirical research aiming evaluation of environmental awareness in one of the southern region of Russia ? Krasnodar region.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of renewable energy}} sources development in Russia are complex and require long-term structural solutions in national socio-economy system. Currently, the Russian economy stays about two and half times less energy efficient and more carbon intensive than other comparable modern countries. General population on its own has not yet embraced energy efficiency as a social value. Among the main barriers to deployment of renewable energy technologies pointed out by experts are the lack of political, legislative and regulatory support, energy prices that {{do not reflect the}} costs of production, low electric power and <b>heat</b> <b>tariffs,</b> lack of information for decision makers, and preference for centralized energy supplies barriers all contribute to an inadequate investment climate for renewable energy technologies. But in some southern regions of Russia with favorable natural conditions and a comparatively low degree of economic centralization the situation is different. Good environmental conditions are very important for socio-economic development of two of those southern regions, the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Adygea, which are currently promoted as tourist areas. Because of rapid infrastructure and economic development, the Krasnodar region has the biggest shortage of electricity in the country. The advantage of Krasnodar Region is the relatively low level of centralization of population and economic activity in the major cities. It makes off-grid technologies a growing focus of interest. In this paper the natural conditions for development renewable energy in Krasnodar region are studied, the potential environmental and ecological effects of renewables of different types are evaluated. For the Russian economy at present time the problem of lack of investment and unemployment is not as important as the problem of structural imbalances. Deindustrialization characterized structural change in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the transition to a market economy, and has transformed in early 2000 into reallocation of labor and capital to the oil&gas industry. Therefore, instead of the traditional input-output tool that estimates the number of jobs, salaries, and overall economic activity that will likely result from the renewable power project (JEDI model), we use a simplified approach, which allows us to identify the potential beneficiaries from growing demand for renewables among Russian manufacturers of power equipment. It is demonstrated that the expected environmental effect from the biogas and heat pumps technologies implementation in the Krasnodar region is the most significant in comparison with other types of renewable energy sources...|$|R
40|$|Part of the U. S. Initiative on Joint Implementation {{with the}} Ukraine Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change, {{financed by the}} US Department of Energy. The project was {{implemented}} by a team consisting of the US company SenTech, Inc. and the Ukrainian company Esco-West. The main objective of the effort was to assess available alternatives of Ivano-Frankivsk (I-F) District Heating repowering and provide information for I-F's investment decision process. This study provides information on positive and negative technical and economic aspects of available options. Three options were analyzed for technical merit and economic performance: 1. Installation of cogeneration system based on Gas Turbine (GT) and Heat Recovery Heat Exchanger with thermal capacity of 30 MW and electrical capacity of 13. 5 MW. This Option assumes utilization of five existing boilers with total capacity of 221 MW. Existing boilers will be equipped with modern controls. Equipment in this Option was sized for longest operating hours, about 8000 based on the available summer baseload. 2. Installation of Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) and Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) with thermal capacity 45 MW and electrical capacity of 58. 7 MW. This Option assumes utilization of five existing boilers with total capacity of 221 MW. Existing boilers will be equipped with modern controls. The equipment was sized for medium, shoulder season thermal load, and some cooling was assumed during the summer operation for extension of operating hours for electricity production. 3. Retrofit of six existing boilers (NGB) with total thermal capacity of 255. 9 MW by installation of modern control system and minor upgrades. This option assumes only heat production with minimum investment. The best economic performance and the largest investment cost would result from alternative GTCC. This alternative has positive Net Present Value (NPV) with discount rate lower than about 12 %, and has IRR slightly above 12 %. The lowest economic results, and the lowest required investment, would result from alternative NGB. This Option's NPV is negative even at 0 % discount rate, and would not become positive even by improving some parameters within a reasonable range. The Option with Gas Turbine displays relatively modest results and the NPV is positive for low discount rate, higher price of sold electricity and lower cost of natural gas. The IRR of this alternative is 9. 75 %, which is not very attractive. The largest influences on the investment are from the cost of electricity sold to the grid, the <b>heat</b> <b>tariff,</b> {{and the cost of}} natural gas. Assuming the implementation of the GTCC alternative, the benefit of the project is also reflected in lower Green House Emissions...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy and Climate Change has {{recently}} announced a proposed doubling of GSHP Renewable <b>Heat</b> Incentive <b>tariffs</b> on smaller installations and tripling them on larger installations {{to support the}} growth of the GSHP market financially. It reflects the perceived importance of this technology to the United Kingdom. Ensuring long term performance {{is one of the key}} factors to achieve an economical and sustainable array design solution for this emerging technology. Experience suggests the majority of plants installed in buildings are likely to be replaced in every 20 to 25 years in order to remain competitive. However, it is widely assumed that the ground arrays will have a relatively long life span for at least 50 years or even more. Nevertheless, the impact of future climate or the progressively tightening building regulation on insulation standards are not usually being considered in the array design process. This might lead to a significant reduction on the long term heat pump performance and minimising the carbon saving potential would have been received from this technology. This paper is intended to investigate the influence of the climate and building insulation standards on the long term GSHP performance for a school building. A numerical analysis is carried out to simulate the long term performance of GSHP over 50 years. Future weather data will be adopted in order to simulate the future heating and cooling demands of the selected building under two different building insulation standards. The findings from this work suggest that impact of the future climate should always be considered in the design stage in order to optimise the thermal load ‘self balancing’ potential especially in a heating dominated building. The impact of improving the insulation standard is obvious when compared to the base case that only considering the current climate but less obvious when compared to the impact caused by the future climate alone. It is suggested that detailed numerical analysis is required to provide information that allows engineers to make the right design on the array length and heat pump capacity that could optimise the performance over the whole life perspective...|$|R

40|$|While {{demand for}} {{electricity}} continues to grow, {{expansion of the}} traditional electricity supply system, or macrogrid, is constrained and is unlikely {{to keep pace with}} the growing thirst western economies have for electricity. Furthermore, no compelling case has been made that perpetual improvement in the overall power quality and reliability (PQR) delivered is technically possible or economically desirable. An alternative path to providing high PQR for sensitive loads would generate close to them in microgrids, such as the Consortium for Electricity Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) Microgrid. Distributed generation would alleviate the pressure for endless improvement in macrogrid PQR and might allow the establishment of a sounder economically based level of universal grid service. Energy conversion from available fuels to electricity close to loads can also provide combined heat and power (CHP) opportunities that can significantly improve the economics of small-scale on-site power generation, especially in hot climates when the waste heat serves absorption cycle cooling equipment that displaces expensive on-peak electricity.

DER-CAM is used to conduct a systemic energy analysis of a southern California naval base building and demonstrates a typical current economic on-site power opportunity. Results achieve cost reductions of about 15 percent with DER, depending on the tariff. Furthermore, almost all of the energy is provided on-site, indicating that modest cost savings can be achieved when the microgrid is free to select distributed genera-tion and heat recovery equipment in order to minimise its over all costs...|$|R
40|$|Like other EU countries, Finland must {{implement}} the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), requiring all new buildings {{to be nearly}} Zero Energy Buildings from the year 2021. Municipal buildings are required to be nearly Zero Energy Buildings from the year 2019. This thesis investigates municipal service buildings {{and the role of}} solar photovoltaics (PV) in improving their energy performance, in view of the future nZEB regulation. Three case study municipal service buildings from Tampere, Finland, are modelled and their energy performance is simulated. The service buildings include a day-care centre, a school and a renovated old people’s home. Simulation-based optimization is employed to find the optimal solar panel areas and inclinations for each case study building. The objectives to be minimized are net present value (NPV) of system life-cycle cost for 20 years and building primary energy consumption. A standard commercially available solar panel type is assumed. Electricity pricing is based on current rates. It is found that own solar PV generation can lower the service building energy performance considerably, if there is enough roof space for panel installation. With current electricity tariffs, PV generation is financially profitable in the old people’s home, where it can bring a maximum profit of 2, 7 – 3, 6 €/m 2, depending on the main heating solution. The maximum profit occurs with 461 m 2 of solar panels, with inclination angle of 48 °, and combined with an air-to-water heat pump. With this arrangement, the primary energy use of the building is lowered by 13 %. Generally solar PV production is a more profitable combination with a heat pump solution than with district heating. Solar PV generation does not create a net profit in the day-care or school building, because unlike the old people’s home, they are closed during the summer. The profitability of solar PV generation also depends on the basic <b>heating</b> solution, electricity <b>tariffs,</b> the future behaviour of real interest rate, energy price escalation and solar panel pricing. Sensitivity analysis and additional optimization cases reveal that even for the day-care and school buildings, financial profitability is not far away. If considering the measured electricity use from the whole property of the day-care centre, installing solar PV is profitable even at current electricity tariffs and installation prices, creating a maximum profit of 1, 6 – 1, 8 €/m 2. Key recommendation for municipalities is to design new care housing buildings with enough south-facing roof area for a large solar PV system. Solar PV production should be first implemented in buildings that are occupied throughout the year, and can utilize as much as possible of the own generation. When considering the profitability of the solar PV installation, it is necessary to know the actual electricity consumption arising from the whole property, and not just the building. For educational buildings, solar PV is the best candidate for the buildings that are open also in the summer, e. g. those day-care centres that do not close for the summer holiday. Even if the future nZEB targets do not necessitate own solar PV generation in municipal service buildings, both the financial profitability and the energy efficiency improvements should encourage municipal solar PV installations, especially in nursing homes...|$|R
