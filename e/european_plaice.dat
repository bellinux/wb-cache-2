40|$|European {{flounder}} (Platichthys flesus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) are commercially important marine {{fish species}} inhabiting the continental shelf waters of Europe. Morphological {{similarity between the}} two {{makes it difficult to}} identify their hybrids, so species misclassification can generate errors in defining stocks in terms of their conservation and management. Flounder and plaice popu-lations from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were studied. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was used to confirm the morphological species identification. The set of molecular markers, two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and D-loop) and two nuclear (the ribosomal marker ITS and parathyroid hormone-related protein gene), was constructed to identify the two flatfish species and their hybrids. “Pure ” flounder (P. flesus) were observed in the Bay of Gdańsk, Baltic Sea, and off the coast of Denmark in the North Sea. The fishing area near Bornholm in the Baltic is rich in P. flesus P. platessa hybrids. The length difference of the amplified D-loop fragment was used for species identification. The characteristics of heteroplasmy in the control region (D-loop) can be useful as a population marker in the European flounder. Our studies demonstrate the utility of mtDNA polymorphism combined with nuclear molecular markers for correct identification of the morphologically similar and hybridized <b>European</b> flounder and <b>plaice...</b>|$|R
40|$|Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) is the United Kingdom’s {{most popular}} {{commercial}} flatfish and {{accounts for the}} greatest landings weight (97, 000 tonnes (t) in 2011 (1)) of the flatfish species in Europe. In 2011, 4, 000 t of plaice was landed into UK ports, with a first-sale value of £ 5. 1 million (2). In 2012, UK consumption of all plaice products was 1, 900 t with a value of £ 22 million (3). This equates to around 6, 000 t of whole fish or around 6 % of world consumption. Plaice is purchased fresh, chilled or frozen and obtained from the UK and other European countries such as Holland {{as well as from}} Iceland. Plaice is not suitable for aquaculture, giving relatively poor returns on investment. The similarly-named American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) is a separate species and should not be marketed as plaice in the UK. The North Sea (which yields around 80 % of the <b>European</b> catch of <b>plaice)</b> and western English Channel plaice stocks are inside safe biological limits. There is a management plan (4) implemented for the North Sea stocks of plaice and sole (which are caught together) aimed at improving long-term yields and reducing the risk of stock depletion. Four fisheries landing plaice from the North Sea are currently MSC certified (5). Of the other major stocks, plaice in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (yields approx. 9, 000 t per annum) and Baltic (approx. 3, 000 t pa), and the Icelandic stock (approx. 6, 500 t pa), appear to b...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general {{framework for the}} automated estimation of age and growth from images of biological materials depicting concentric ring-like structures such as tree trunks, corals, bivalve seashells, fish scales or otoliths. This interpretation task {{can be seen as}} a ring segmentation issue, where growth rings are associated to image ridge and valley structures. This is stated as the Bayesian selection of a subset of partial ring curves extracted using a semi-local template-based growth-adapted scheme. The application to fish otolith interpretation provides a consistent and convincing validation of the proposed framework. 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND RELATED WORK Age and growth data acquired from the analysis of ring-like structures in biological hard tissues (fish otoliths, shells of sea shells, tree trunks, corals, [...] .) are key information for a broad range of scientific issues such as marine stock assessments, marine ecology, paleoclimatology or archeology. We provide examples of such images involving ring-like structures in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 4. The deposit of ring structures is mostly periodic (mainly seasonal or daily depending). Counting growth rings then leads to an estimation of the age, whereas growth increments can be estimated from the distance between successive rings. Since large collections of biological data are needed (typically, several thousands of samples per year for fish stock assessment), computeraided tools [8] are being sought. Our work is dedicated to the automation of age and growth estimation from the analysis of images of biological hard tissues. The key issues, as illustrated in Fig. 1, lie in the use of growth information both to design a robust ring extraction framework taking into account growth non-linearity, and to discriminate actual growth rings from irrelevant ones. Previous work [5, 9, 10] has mainly focused on the information extraction step but have not tackled the actual interpretation task. The latter is a complex issue as stressed by the the results of the <b>European</b> workshop on <b>plaice</b> otolith interpretation held i...|$|R

50|$|They {{include many}} {{important}} commercially fished species, including {{not only the}} various fish called flounders, but also the <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> the halibuts, the lemon sole, the common dab, the Pacific Dover sole, and the flukes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) is a right-eyed {{flounder}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. They are a commercially important flatfish which lives on the sandy bottoms of the European shelf. They range geographically from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean. <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> are characterised by their smooth brown skin, with distinctive red spots and bony ridge behind the eyes. They feed on polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves {{and can be found}} at depths up to 200 metres. At night they move into shallow waters to feed, and during the day they bury themselves in the sand. Their maximum recorded length is 100 cm (39.4 inches), and maximum reported age 50 years.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century large {{quantities}} of herring were produced in Scotland.Today mainly mackerel, Atlantic cod, whiting, coalfish, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> and sole are caught.

5000|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> is off all coasts from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean, also in the Northeast Atlantic and off Greenland. In some locales such as the Irish Sea this species is considered fully exploited by commercial fishing.|$|E
5000|$|Like the <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> the American plaice {{is a right}} eyed {{flatfish}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. American plaice are an Atlantic species, which range from southern Labrador to Rhode Island. They are also found in Europe, where they are called rough dab or long rough dab. They spawn in the Gulf of Maine, with peak activity in April and May. They are brown or reddish, and are generally smaller than <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> with a rougher skin and larger scales. Their maximum recorded length is 82.6 cm (32.5 inches), and maximum reported age 30 years. They are usually found between depths of 90 metres and 250 metres, on sandy bottoms with temperatures between -0.5 and 2.5°C. They feed on small fishes and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> is characterised above {{by their}} dark green to dark brown skin, blotched with conspicuous, but irregularly distributed, orange spots. The {{underside}} is pearly white. The skin is smooth with small scales. They {{are able to}} adapt their colour somewhat to match that of their surroundings, but the orange spots always remain visible. The skin lacks any prickles.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} more {{specific}} habitat requirements than other widespread Atlantic flatfish {{such as the}} <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> common sole, and common dab. It is concentrated in waters moderately influenced by estuary outflows, at a salinity of 29-33 ppt, and is absent from the mouths of the largest estuaries where the salinity is lower.

50|$|The European {{flounder}} is {{used for}} human consumption but is not so highly esteemed as the <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> or common sole (Solea solea). The most important fisheries are in the Baltic Sea and the waters around the Netherlands and Denmark. In 2010, the total world catch was about nineteen thousand tonnes, mostly caught by bottom trawling. The fish is marketed fresh and frozen and can be fried, boiled, steamed, baked or microwaved.|$|E
50|$|The genus Lymphocystivirus {{has only}} one species: Lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1), but Lymphocystis disease virus 2 (LCD-2) is another virus that has been {{proposed}} as a second member.

50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Hediste diversicolor is {{widespread}} and common and is eaten by {{many species of}} birds and fish. It is the main food item for the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), the curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) and the curlew (Numenius arquata). Several flatfish which live on intertidal mudflats feed on the ragworm. These include the common dab (Limanda limanda), the common sole (Solea solea), the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) and the <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa).|$|E

The old arms of Inderøy were continued since fishing is still important to the culture and history of the new municipality. The 4 fish shown on the arms now represent the four original municipalities that now make up Inderøy: Inderøy, Mosvik, Røra, and Sandvollan.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is not {{commonly}} practised in Langland these days, {{either from}} the beach or from the rocky shore. A strikingly marked large rock {{on the western side}} of the bay called Cross Rock used to be a popular spot to fish at high tide in the summer months with float and soft crab as bait. Catches included bass, sea bream and dogfish. Langland Point held similar promise, but the use of spinners or feathers here sometimes delivered mackerel as well as bass. Occasional Common dab and <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> were caught with lugworm or ragworm from the beach, although the worm population of the beach has always been small.|$|E
50|$|Stomach {{sampling}} {{studies have}} discovered that small Atlantic cod feed primarily on crustaceans, while large Atlantic cod feed primarily on fish. In certain regions, the main food source is decapods with fish as a complementary food item in the diet. Wild Atlantic cod throughout the North Sea depend, to a large extent, on commercial fish species also used in fisheries, such as Atlantic mackerel, haddock, whiting, Atlantic herring, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> and common sole, making fishery manipulation of cod significantly easier. Ultimately, food selection by cod {{is affected by the}} food item size relative to their own size. However, providing for size, cod do exhibit food preference and are not simply driven by availability.|$|E
50|$|The European {{flounder}} leaves freshwater in {{the autumn}} and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female liberates about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male liberates sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast with juvenile flounders living in shallow waters and estuaries. Young flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure 11.5 cm and the females when they measure 18 cm. The European flounder sometimes hybridises with <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common.|$|E
5000|$|This isopod is very inactive, {{and most}} of its time is spent stationary, {{concealed}} in a crevice or under a stone on the seabed. It needs to feed very infrequently and when it does so it clings onto a host fish with its front three pairs of pleiopods. Younger specimens choose thin skin close to the fins but older ones are indiscriminate in their site of attachment. It then plunges its mouthparts into the fish. It has strong muscles in its oesophagus and large salivary glands and rapidly fills its dilatable hind gut with blood. It then drops off the fish and spends several months on the seabed digesting the blood.In a research study, specimens of Aega antarctica were kept in a marine aquarium at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, where they were maintained at a temperature of [...] It was found that they would feed on a number of species of fish native to the North Sea and in this research they were fed on live <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa). One fish was introduced to the isopods at intervals of a month and even so, they often voluntarily went for several months without feeding. Even when deprived of food for ten months, some individuals still had traces of blood in their gut, visible through their translucent outer surface. Growth was very slow and females did not mature until they were at least ten years old.|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa; Pleuronectidae) is {{considered}} the most important flatfish for fisheries in Europe. Overall catches have been reduced drastically throughout the past decades, indicating a severe decline in the natural populations.

Sequences of <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> and its congener, the winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) deposited in the public database were searched for short tandem repeats.

40|$|Abstract Six {{flatfish}} {{species were}} collected by trawling at five locations in the inner and middle Oslofjord between February and December in 2013. In total 386 individuals were sampled. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to identify the infection of Hysterothylacium aduncum and Cucullanus heterochrous. Only three species contained these parasites: American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes platessa) and Witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus). Also the condition, age distribution and weight-length relationship was measured on these fish species. There was a geographical difference in the percentage of infected fish between the middle and inner part of the Oslofjord, as most nematodes were found in the middle part of the fjord. American plaice was the most abundant species and also the most infected specie. Two decades ago this species was not a known host, but during the last years this species has become an important host in the fjord. Hysterothylacium aduncum infected all three fish species with large abundances in the middle Oslofjord. It seems that H. aduncum has been in an increasing trend over the last two decades. American plaice starts to mature at 2 and 3 years, and these age groups were most infected. Females were more infected than males. There was no correlation between the length of the nematodes and the condition of the host.

They are used predominantly for expression profiling but are increasingly employed {{for the analysis of}} complex environmental samples. This thesis presents the development of a DNA microarray prototype for the identification of gadoid and flatfish species from the southern North Sea. First of all partial sequences of mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and 16 S rRNA genes were determined for adult gadoid and flatfish specimens. Based on COI and 16 S rDNA alignments capture oligonucleotide probes were selected, spotted onto glass slides and the resulting DNA microarrays were tested successfully with fish samples. COI DNA sequences showed sufficient sequence variability for the selection of capture probes even for the discrimination of closely related fish species, e. g. flounder and <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> whereas 16 S rDNA sequences were too conserved within the families Pleuronectidae and Gadidae to select species specific probes, but were very suitable for the selection of probes for Soleidae and Scophthalmidae species, due to the presence of highly variable regions. The evaluation of 34 COI probes for the identification of Atlantic cod, whiting, flounder, dab, <b>European</b> <b>plaice,</b> American plaice, lemon sole and common sole and 10 16 S rDNA probes for turbot, brill, common sole and solenette resulted in 34 species specific, 6 false negative and 4 cross reacting probes. Signal strength varied considerably among all probes and was correlated with the position of the probe binding region and influenced by the concentration of the target DNA and the presence of non target DNA. LNA-modified COI probes showed in some cases improvements concerning the specificity and the sensitivity but altogether increased the proportion of false negative or cross reacting probes. Some probes with HEG 2 spacers exhibited increased signal intensities but spacers also resulted in cross hybridizations...|$|E

40|$|Anthropogenic {{noise is}} a {{recognized}} global pollutant {{that could potentially}} impact many organisms, including fishes. One of the acoustic sources producing high impulsive noise and vibration is pile driving. However, the potential impacts of real pile driving on fish species has received little attention, mainly due to the logistical challenges involved. Here, we investigated the impact of pile driving on the oxygen uptake (a secondary stress response) of black seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus and <b>European</b> <b>plaice</b> Pleuronectes platessa using an experimental pile driver setup in a flooded ship-building dock. Each individual fish was tested in ambient and pile driving conditions using a counterbalanced paired design to control for potential order effects. During pile driving, black seabream increased oxygen uptake compared to the ambient control condition suggesting higher stress levels. Plaice did not show differences in oxygen consumption between the pile driving and ambient treatment. These results show the impact of pile driving on secondary stress responses in fish, highlight species-specific differences concerning acoustical impacts, and showcase the possibility of carrying out large-scale semi-field acoustic experiments...|$|E
