40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) object reconstruction {{technique that}} uses only phase information of a phase-shifting <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> and a phase-only spatial-light modulator is proposed. It {{is well known}} that a <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> can store both amplitude and phase information of an optical electric field and can reconstruct the original 3 D object in a computer.

Reconstruction at every depth to create an extended-focus image is a time-consuming process. We investigate the human visual system's ability to perceive 3 D objects {{in the presence of}} blurring when different depth reconstructions are presented to each eye. Our <b>digital</b> <b>holograms</b> are sufficiently large that subregions can be digitally propagated to generate the necessary stereo disparity.

40|$|Recording {{and real}} time {{reconstruction}} of <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> sequences have recently become feasible. The {{amount of information}} that such hologram sequences contain results in voluminous data files, rendering their storage and transmission impractical. As a result, compression of <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> sequences is of utmost importance for practical applications of hologram sequences. In {{the absence of a}} specific hologram sequence compression technique, a first concern is how a high-performance conventional video compression technique would perform. Such a technique would not be optimized for hologram sequences but would provide a threshold that all hologram sequence compression techniques should reach. In this paper, the use of MPEG- 4 part 2 video coding algorithm for the compression of hologram sequences is investigated. Although the algorithm was originally developed for the compression of ordinary video, we apply it on <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> sequences and investigate its performance. For this, appropriate <b>digital</b> <b>hologram</b> sequences are used to asses how the coding algorithm affects their information content. In addition, we investigate whether MPEG- 4 interframe coding, which aims to achieve compression by exploiting similarities across adjacent frames of the sequence, offers any advantage compared to intraframe coding, where each frame is coded independently. Results show that the MPEG- 4 coding algorithm can successfully compress hologram sequences to compression rates of ∼ 20 : 1 while retaining the reconstruction quality of the hologram sequences...|$|E

A series of holograms are recorded by CCD camera and the original phase can be reconstructed by Fresnel reconstruction algorithm.
