30|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>finding</b> is a {{major issue}} of {{interest}} in array signal processing for MIMO radar. In this context, this issue has drawn attention from researchers in recent years. The quaternion theory was applied in <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> for bistatic MIMO radar by means of singular value decomposition and root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) in [6]. An ESPRIT-based algorithm was presented via the banded symmetric and Toeplitz matrices for <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of bistatic MIMO radar in [7]. The unitary dual-resolution ESPRIT algorithm was proposed for <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> of bistatic MIMO radar without extra pairing in [8].

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Scarborough station was classified as a Y-station.

5000|$|Doreen Patterson Reitsma (December 12, 1927 - April 30, 2000) was {{the first}} woman from British Columbia to enter Canada's newly created Postwar Women's Division of the Royal Canadian Navy. She began her basic {{training}} on October 2, 1951, at [...] in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia. She was trained as an elite radio intelligence operator for the wireless communications base at HMC NRS Coverdale. Coverdale was located near the city of Moncton, New Brunswick and was part of the Canada-USA Atlantic High Frequency <b>Direction</b> <b>Finding</b> <b>Network</b> responsible for the collection of military intelligence. Ms. Patterson was chosen to serve a term at the Naval Radio Station at Churchill, Manitoba in 1953-54. Here, she was part of a special force of eleven Wrens trained to live and work in extreme weather conditions. These Wrens are recognized as the only women in the Royal Canadian Navy's history to have ever served at the base in Churchill.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} {{radio direction finding}} (RDF) VHF receiver {{has been}} investigated for development into a radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> <b>network</b> (RDFN) with a particular focus towards public service and commercial asset tracking applications. The primary design criteria were reproducibility, low-cost, and simplicity such that public service and volunteer organizations can benefit from the technology. Two receiver designs were built and tested to allow for comparison of practicality, cost, and accuracy. A pseudo-Doppler RDF and a time difference of arrival (TDOA) receiver were built as proof-of-concept for a system design based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The pseudo-Doppler system is a less practical implementation due to the necessity for custom hardware, a large antenna system, and an increased directional error due to multipath and weak signals. The TDOA system has potential as a very simple and low-cost RDFN implementation, but requires extremely accurate time synchronization {{that is difficult to}} achieve using COTS GPS receiver modules. The final proposed solution takes advantage of the simple TDOA hardware and multiple detection techniques (including signal strength) to produce improved locational data and ultimately provide a more accurate estimate of position. Further development and improvements to this receiver design have the potential for implementation as a low-cost radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> <b>network...</b>|$|E

40|$|A radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a {{receiver}} {{arranged in a}} combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, single channel techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for single channel DF is considerably less than for multi-channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have been previously investigated. Since many of the single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques are older analog techniques and have been analyzed in previous work, we will investigate a new single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> technique that takes specific advantage of digital capabilities.
