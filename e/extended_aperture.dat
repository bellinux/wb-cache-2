50|$|One key {{technique}} for achieving high sensitivity in the FUV is minimizing {{the number of}} optics. This is done because FUV reflection and transmission efficiencies are typically quite low compared to what is common at visible wavelengths. In accomplishing this, the COS FUV channel uses a single (selectable) optic to diffract the light from HST, correct for the Hubble spherical aberration, focus the diffracted light onto the FUV detector and correct for astigmatism typical {{of this sort of}} instrument. Since aberration correction is performed after the light passes into the instrument, the entrance to the spectrograph must be an <b>extended</b> <b>aperture,</b> rather than the traditional narrow entrance slit, in order to allow the entire aberrated HST image from a point source to enter the instrument. The 2.5 arc second diameter entrance aperture allows ≈ 95% of the light from compact sources to enter COS, yielding high sensitivity at the design resolution for compact sources.|$|E

40|$|The {{reflector}} antenna may {{be thought}} of as an aperture antenna. The classical solution for the radiation pattern of such an antenna is found by the aperture integration (AI) method.

This approximation is suitable for calculating the main beam and possibly the first few sidelobes. A better approximation is to use aperture currents calculated from the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). Integration of the GTD currents over and <b>extended</b> <b>aperture</b> yields more accurate results for the radiation pattern.

In spotlight SAR mode the azimuth resolution of the baseline and repeat pass imagery may be improved by collecting an <b>extended</b> <b>aperture</b> therefore allowing finer resolution estimates of the scene coherence. The formation of the imagery however requires adequate compensation of the wavefront curvature effects which become increasing significant in finer resolution imagery. In N. E. Doren (1997) it is shown that for spotlight SAR imagery, formed using the Polar Format Algorithm (PFA), wavefront curvature effects give rise to residual phase errors that may be removed using an image domain filtering technique. The analysis however is based on the formation of a slant plane image obtained by projection of the scene reflectivity along circular arcs centered on the flight track. In this paper a full 3 D imaging geometry is considered to derive an appropriate post PFA image domain filter to form a ground plane image. This allows multipass images to be formed in a common image plane for subsequent interferometric processing.

30|$|As it {{is widely}} known, there are four typical methods for passive {{synthetic}} array, namely, the method introduced by Yen and Carey [1], Extended towed-array measurements (ETAM) [2], Maximum Likelihood method (ML) [3], and FFT Synthetic Aperture processing method (FFTSA) [4]. The method introduced by Yen and Carey is a processing technique in the beam domain which provides coherent processing of subapertures by proper selection of a phase term based on knowledge {{or the use of}} a velocity filter concept for the source-receiver relative speed. In the ETAM algorithm, developed by Stergiopoulos and Sullivan, the successive subaperture signals are coherently synthesized in the aperture domain into an <b>extended</b> <b>aperture</b> size by using a phase correction factor, which is derived by cross-correlating overlapping space samples of the acoustic signal received at successive moments by the moving array. The ML method requires the acquisition of very long hydrophone time series over an interval which is required by the moving towed array to travel a distance equivalent to the desired length of the synthetic aperture. It performs a two-dimensional search in equivalent phase and frequency domains to yield the best estimates of the unknown parameters. FFTSA method is like the method introduced by Yen and Carey, but it does not need the velocity information. It performs coherent processing of subaperture signals at successive time intervals in the beam domain via FFT transformations. Theoretical studies and sea experiments showed that ETAM method yielded the best performance among them [5, 6].|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{to the problem of}} scattering of electromagnetic waves by metallic bodies are examined, in the context of earlier work done at the University of Surrey under a contract from the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. A review of this earlier work is given, followed by some fundamental electromagnetic theory and a discussion of solutions of the two dimensional wave equation. This leads naturally to the introduction of the Rayleigh hypothesis for scattering from irregularly shaped cylinders. The analytical continuation method of Wilton and Mittra for overcoming the problem of the invalidity of the Rayleigh hypothesis is given, and its reformulation in matrix notation motivates discussion of the properties of the scattering matrices of bodies which gave a number of symmetries. Because the scattering matrix of a body, depends only on the body and not at all upon the incident field, any symmetries of the scatterer must be reflected {{in the form of the}} scattering matrix. These results are used to discuss the boundary condition problem for a perfectly conducting body of rotation. Chapter eight contains an attempt to <b>extend</b> <b>aperture</b> field theory as used for calculating near-axis fields in, for example, reflector antenna systems to more general scattering problems. Some related work by Bach and his associates is discussed. In chapter nine an alternative approach to the calculation of the scattering matrix is given which leads to a reformulation of the method of physical optics. The modified method is used to investigate the validity of the Rayleigh hypothesis for a slightly perturbed circular cylinder and the results compared with those due to Van Den Berg and Fokkema. Finally, in chapter ten another method of overcoming the invalidity of the Rayleigh hypothesis is examined, but is shown to be impractical to implement numerically...|$|R
40|$|Detection and {{localization}} of stationary {{and moving}} targets within a building or an enclosed structure are highly desirable in through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI) and urban sensing applications.

Second, the need for highly resolved images results in acquisition, storage, and processing of huge amounts of data [2]. To this end, we propose a general MIMO framework for exploiting multipath propagation employing compressive sensing (CS).

In this work, the minimization is extended to parameters that characterize expected amplitudes of each image element in the area of interest. An iterative optimization scheme is proposed, which in each step performs minimization of the reconstruction error based on the parameter matrix found in the previous step. Comparing to ESAFT, the proposed approach yields a significant improvement in resolution and a high degree of robustness with regard to initial choice of the parameter matrix. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using both real and simulated ultrasonic data. I...|$|R

By defining a model space in terms of an irregularly sampled velocity space to minimize the number of unknowns during the inversion and using sparse matrices, however, the computation time can be kept low enough for practical application. We implement hyperbolic and elliptical time domain RTs by using inversion via weighted conjugate gradient methods with a sparseness constraint.
