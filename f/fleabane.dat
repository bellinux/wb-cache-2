5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several {{projects have been}} done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to provide}} habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette <b>fleabane,</b> and Kincaid's lupine. In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fleabane,</b> {{helps with}} bites from 'venomous beasts' and its smoke can kill gnats and fleas. Can be {{dangerous}} for pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Adults feed {{primarily}} on nectar of Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), Knapweeds (Centaurea spp.), Dandelion (Taraxacum), <b>Fleabane</b> (Pulicaria dysenterica), Marjoram (Origanum vulgare), Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and Vetches (Vicia spp.).|$|E
50|$|<b>Fleabane's</b> {{common name}} comes from its former use as an incense to drive away insects. Other past uses include {{treatments}} for dysentery and unspecified ocular maladies.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} <b>fleabanes,</b> it has leaves evenly spaced {{all over the}} stem. They may be thready or wide and flat, and are between 1 - 7 cm long.|$|R
50|$|They {{are native}} to {{tropical}} and warm temperate regions throughout the world, and also north into cool temperate regions in North America and eastern Asia. The New World {{species of the}} genus {{are closely related to}} Erigeron (also known as <b>fleabanes).</b>|$|R
25|$|Senecio congestus, {{also known}} by its common names swamp ragwort, {{northern}} swamp groundsel, marsh <b>fleabane,</b> marsh fleawort, clustered marsh ragwort and mastodon flower, a herbaceous member of the Asteraceae family and the Senecio genus, can be seen most easily when its bright yellow umbel flowers appear from May to early July standing 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) along marshes, stream banks and slough areas where it likes to grow.|$|E
25|$|The year-round water supply, {{makes the}} forest canopy {{particularly}} lush in the otherwise dry Sonoran Desert, {{and is one}} of the most unusual forest types in North America. The predominant tress are Goodding’s willows and Fremont cottonwoods. Others species found within the Preserve include desert fan palms, saguaro, Barrel cactus, cholla cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. Flowering plants such as penstemon, verbena, <b>fleabane,</b> lupine, poppies, primroses, mallows, elderberries, claret cup hedgehog cactus, desert willow, aster, sacred datura, desert broom, yerba mansa, brittlebush are also found in the Preserve. Non-native which now call the Preserve home include figs and mulberries.|$|E
500|$|Drought escape {{by growing}} in small crevices or near {{persistent}} water supplies, or by staying dormant for about 95% of the year. Mosses and ferns {{in the area}} grow near constant water sources such as natural potholes and seeps from ice caves. Scabland penstemon, fernleaf <b>fleabane,</b> and gland cinquefoil grow in shallow crevices. Syringa, bush rockspirea, tansybush, and even limber pine grow in large crevices. While dwarf monkeyflowers (...) carry out their entire life cycle during the short wet {{part of the year}} and survive in seed form the rest of the time.|$|E
50|$|Members of this genus {{might be}} known as camphorweeds, plucheas, or less uniquely <b>fleabanes.</b> Some, such as P. carolinensis and P. odorata, are called sourbushes. There are plants of many forms, from annual and {{perennial}} herbs to shrubs and trees, and there is variation in the morphology of leaves, flowers, and fruits.|$|R
50|$|Threats to wetland birds at {{the refuge}} include nonnative and {{invasive}} {{plants and animals}} and outbreaks of avian botulism. Predation by free-ranging dogs, feral cats, rats, the nonnative American bullfrog, and the small Asian mongoose threatens birds and their nests. These predators are controlled on the refuge to protect the birds. Populations of the koloa are affected by hybridization with Mallards. Exotic plants such as para grass (Urochloa mutica) and marsh <b>fleabanes</b> (Pluchea spp.) can degrade habitat quality by invading wetlands and competing with local flora. Such plants are controlled with prescribed burning, water level fluctuation, and mechanical clearing.|$|R
40|$|This, {{the first}} of three volumes on the aster family planned for the Illustrated Flora of Illinois series, recognizes 388 species in 119 genera, as well as 20 hybrids and 73 lesser taxa. In Asteraceae, Part 1, author Robert Mohlenbrock {{presents}} new and historic information in a clear and easy-to-read style. The volume provides an easy-to-use key to the genera and species and a complete description and nomenclatural and habitat notes for each plant, including its usefulness, if applicable. New nomenclatural combinations are shown for several species. The precise illustrations and detailed information allow for the identification {{of some of the most}} difficult to identify plants in the state—goldenrods, asters, artemisias, and <b>fleabanes,</b> among others. Includes 128 original illustrations by Paul Nelson. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the edge}} of the meadows near the forest and along the Bare Creek drainage, there are high {{mountain}} cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, Sitka valerian, cowebby Indian paintbrush, harsh Indian paintbrush, broadleaf lupine, and alpine lake agoseris. [...] On drier slopes above the lake, Newberry's knotweed, larkspur, bracted lousewort, peregrine <b>fleabane,</b> dwarf lupine, sulphur flower, Martindale's lomatium, pussypaws, pink mountain heather, and Brewers mountain heather are common along with alpine lake agoseris.|$|E
2500|$|Conyza bonariensis (also {{known as}} hairy <b>fleabane</b> and buva) and Conyza canadensis (known as {{horseweed}} or marestail), are other weed species that had lately developed glyphosate resistance. A 2008 {{study on the}} current situation of glyphosate resistance in South America concluded [...] "resistance evolution followed intense glyphosate use" [...] {{and the use of}} glyphosate-resistant soybean crops is a factor encouraging increases in glyphosate use. In the 2015 growing season, glyphosate-resistant marestail proved to be especially problematic to control in Nebraska production fields.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle and}} lower slopes of Hager Mountain {{are covered in}} a pine forest with an {{understory}} dominated by low sagebrush.

[...] A few western junipers grow on the lower slopes on the northeast side of the mountain.|$|E
40|$|FOR A FEW SHORT WEEKS each June, {{the stately}} {{flowering}} spikes of Great Plains yuccas illuminate Nebraska’s Sandhills and western plains. On each plant, spires of 20 to 60 ivory-white flowers {{emerge from a}} radiating array of needle-sharp leaves. The flowers rise above {{the rest of the}} vegetation like Roman candles freeze-framed in flight. Entire hillsides are sometimes transformed by this sudden flower display – often along with sprinklings of blue spiderworts, golden yellow hoary puccoons and white daisy <b>fleabanes.</b> After a few weeks the spectacular show is over, but for the yucca the story’s best chapter has barely begun. To reproduce, it depends entirely on a single species of moth, which in turn depends on this lone species of yucca for its own reproduction. Last June in Keith County in western Nebraska, I observed what you might call the oldest romance in the West...|$|R
40|$|This type {{describes}} low, low gray, Lahontan, black, {{and early}} sagebrushes that grow on shallow soils where a root-limiting layer exists. Low and early sagebrush tends to grow where claypan layers {{exist in the}} soil profile and soils are often saturated during {{a portion of the}} year. Black sagebrush tends to grow where either a calcareous or volcanic cement layer exists in the soil profile. Elevations range from 4, 000 ft (Lahontan sagebrush) to 11, 000 ft (low and black sagebrush). Vegetation Description This type includes communities dominated by black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula), Lahontan sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula ssp. Longicaulis), low gray sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula ssp. arbuscula) and early sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula subsp. longiloba). Although these types do not usually grow in combination, they do share similar fire regimes. Dwarf sagebrushes generally have relatively low fuel loads with low growing and cushion forbs and scattered bunch grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), needlegrasses (Achnatherum spp.), Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda) and Indian ricegrass (Oryopsis hymenoides). Forbs often include buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.), <b>fleabanes</b> (Erigeron spp.), phloxs (Phlox spp.), paintbrushes (Castilleja spp.), globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.), and lupines (Lupinus spp.) ...|$|R
60|$|Let us take as {{examples}} a single little set of instances, familiar to everybody, but far commoner {{in the world}} at large than the inhabitants of towns are at all aware of: I mean, the winged seeds, that fly about freely in the air by means of feathery hairs or gossamer, like thistle-down and dandelion. Of these winged types we have many hundred varieties in England alone. All the willow-herbs, for example, have such feathery seeds (or rather fruits) to help them on their way through life; and one kind, the beautiful pink rose-bay, flies about so readily, and over such wide spaces of open country, that the plant is known to farmers in America as fireweed, because it always springs up at once over whole square miles of charred and smoking soil after every devastating forest fire. It travels fast, for it travels like Ariel. In much the same way, the coltsfoot grows on all new English railway banks, because its winged seeds are wafted everywhere in myriads on the winds of March. All the willows and poplars have also winged seeds: so have the whole vast tribe of hawkweeds, groundsels, ragworts, thistles, <b>fleabanes,</b> cat's-ears, dandelions, and lettuces. Indeed, one may say roughly, there are very few plants of any size or importance in the economy of nature which don't deliberately provide, in one way or another, for the dispersal and dissemination of their fruits or seedlings.|$|R
