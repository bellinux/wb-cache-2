The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (<b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just {{did not think of}} splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E

2500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tanner Stransky {{started his}} review by {{pointing}} out the album's lead single [...] "Put It Down" [...] was actually the weakest song on Two Eleven. Stransky said [...] "It's one of the weakest offerings from an otherwise well-crafted for-the-fans album. Ignore what's pushed to pop radio. Brandy scores when her raspy-sweet voice soars during ballads and slow jams, and that's what stands out on this intimate, often ethereal collection." [...] He gave the album a B+ rating. Sarah Godfrey from Washington Post complimented the songs on the album and wrote that the album [...] "serves as a fine tribute , {{in part because it}} {{is a testament to the}} fact that, despite whatever trends are happening in popular music right now, a good voice always shines through." [...] Vibe noted that [...] "experimentation can spell struggle for some artists, but Two Eleven finds Brandy cruising fluidly past the predictable. Swinging from OVO-worthy emo-ethereal reflections to quirky up-tempos, the 18-year vet deviates from overdone slow-tempo production." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Gawker felt that Two Eleven [...] "doesn't sound any younger or older than Brandy is. It's not obtusely hip or desperately serious. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>is,</b> it's just now and it's just right." [...] Elliot Robinson, writing for So So Gay, dismissed Brown's appearance on Two Eleven but praised the tone of the album, writing [...] "When Brandy hits the old school R sound she was aiming for, the tracks are simply stunning." [...] Less enthusiastic with the album, Noah Berlatsky from The Atlantic felt the songs on the album were [...] "worse than the largely ignored Human, but better than the beloved-yet-boring 2002 Full Moon," [...] and added, that [...] "but such parsing seems mostly beside the point. If you're one of the dwindling number of fans of this '90s style, you know what you're getting; if not you'll probably skip it anyway." ...|$|E

60|$|But let us {{leave the}} {{universe}} alone. It {{is too big}} a bauble for me.--Revenons.--At the start of me there is me. There is a mysterious little entity which is my individual self, the god who builds the machine and then makes his gay excursion of seventy years within it. Now we are talking at the moment about the machine. For the moment we are the bicycle, and not the feather-brained cyclist. So that {{all we can do}} is to define the cyclist in terms of ourself. A bicycle could say: Here, upon my leather saddle, rests a strange and animated force, which I call the force of gravity, as being the one great force which controls my universe. And yet, on second thoughts, I must modify myself. This great force of gravity is not always in the saddle. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> not there--and I lean strangely against a wall. I have been even known to turn upside down, with my wheels in the air; spun by the same mysterious Miss. So that I must introduce a theory of Relativity. However, mostly, when I am awake and alive, she is in the saddle; or it is in the saddle, the mysterious force. And when it is in the saddle, then two subsidiary forces plunge and claw upon my two pedals, plunge and claw with inestimable power. And at the same time, a kind and mysterious force sways my head-stock, sways most incalculably, and governs my whole motion. This force is not a driving force, but a subtle directing force, beneath whose grip my bright steel body is flexible as a dipping highroad. Then let me not forget the sudden clutch of arrest upon my hurrying wheels. Oh, this is pain to me! While I am rushing forward, surpassing myself in an élan vital, suddenly the awful check grips my back wheel, or my front wheel, or both. Suddenly there is a fearful arrest. My soul rushes on before my body, I feel myself strained, torn back. My fibers groan. Then perhaps the tension relaxes.|$|E
