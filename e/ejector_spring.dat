50|$|The {{magazine}} well is {{modified to}} accept standard AK box magazines. Although the standard AK magazines use steel or reinforced polymer, the standard KAC SR-47 magazines were made from aluminum alloy like the M16. The magazine well has an <b>ejector</b> <b>spring</b> to eject spent magazines and speed reload times.|$|E
50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the fuse holder is displaced and the fuse holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows. Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an <b>ejector</b> <b>spring</b> in a stable position. When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the fuse holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and fuse holder. This quenches any arc in the fuse holder.|$|E
50|$|The Taubina {{had some}} shortcomings. The {{extractor}} and <b>ejector</b> <b>springs</b> were of poor quality, leading to 7.2% of shots causing a failure. The machine was also inaccurate, with rounds scattering in azimuth. After each clip {{it was necessary}} to re-lay the weapon.|$|R
25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a safety mechanism. This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, <b>ejector</b> and <b>spring,</b> extractor, dummy extractor plug, bolt-head retaining pin, plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's hair brush and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{an article}} in American Handgunner stated that [...] "Marine armorers from the Precision Weapons Section, MCBQ" [...] are making 789 MEU (SOC) 1911's. Corporal Gravenese {{demonstrates}} {{the power of the}} pistol as shown as above. The revised parts list included barrels, bushings, link pins, sear <b>springs,</b> <b>ejectors,</b> firing pin stops, mainspring housings and mainsprings, all from Nowlin Manufacturing. [...] Slides were ordered from Springfield Armory, with front sight pins, beavertail safeties and recoil spring guides from Ed Brown. Novak was contracted for rear sights, Wilson Combat provided extractors and mag release buttons, while King's Gun Works supplied ambidextrous thumb safeties.|$|R
5000|$|The direct {{impingement}} (DI) {{method of}} operation vents gas from partway down the barrel through a tube to the working parts of a rifle where they directly impinge on the bolt carrier. This results in a simpler, lighter mechanism. Firearms that use this system include the French MAS-40 from 1940, the Swedish Ljungman Ag m/42 from 1942, and the American M16 rifle family. One principal advantage is that the moving parts are placed in-line with the bore meaning that sight picture is not disturbed as much. This offers a particular advantage for fully automatic mechanisms. It has the disadvantage of the propellant gas (and the accompanying fouling) being blown directly into the action parts. [...] DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing, which can burn off and cover up lubricants. The bolt, extractor, <b>ejector,</b> pins, and <b>springs</b> are also heated by the same high-temperature gas. These combined factors reduce service life of these parts, reliability, and mean time between failures.|$|R
5000|$|The HK94/SG-1 (ScharfschutzenGewehr, [...] "sharp-shooting rifle") was {{designed}} for short-range sniping in built-up areas like cities or prisons. It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power , and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 × 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope. It had an overall length of 40.39 inches 1026mm and a weight of 9.25 lbs. kg. Its mean standard retail price (MSRP) in 1986 was US$1,525; {{this was more than}} twice what a stock HK94A2 (US$650) or HK94A3 (US$720) cost. Only 50 were imported into the United States; authentic models have serial numbers running in the 43XX range.As an aftermarket modification, a PSG-1 trigger pack with target pistol grip and match trigger could be added by a gunsmith by changing the <b>ejector</b> and hammer <b>spring.</b> The 6× Leupold scope was calibrated for [...]223 Remington rounds, so other scopes were often substituted.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately 25,000 [...]58 caliber Springfield Model 1863 rifled muskets were {{converted}} by Springfield Armory {{for use by}} U.S. troops, the barrels being relined and rifled to [...]50 caliber and the trapdoor breech system affixed. The rifle was chambered for the powerful centerfire [...]50-70 Government cartridge (.50 caliber [...] bullet; [...] of black powder). Though a significant improvement over the extractor of the Model 1865 Springfield Rifle, the Model 1866 extractor was still excessively complicated and the extractor spring somewhat prone to breakage. However, it is a misconception that a broken extractor disabled the weapon. In the official 1867 government user booklet “Description and Rules for the Management of the Springfield Breech-Loading Rifle Musket, Model 1866”, the following is stated regarding a broken extractor and/or ejector: “It should be understood that the <b>ejector</b> and friction <b>springs</b> are convenient rather than necessary, and that the piece is not necessarily disabled if {{one or both of}} them should break, for the shell can be easily removed by the fingers after being loosened by the extractor hook.” Furthermore, the “ramrod” of the rifle can be used quite effectively to remove a stuck case in an emergency. Thus it is clear that this weapon is not as easily disabled as is sometimes believed.|$|R
