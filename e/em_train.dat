40|$|Economists since 1965 search a way {{to measure}} the value of time. This paper {{addresses}} empirical results from a theoretical background proposed in the particular case of transport. The Tuong and Hensher (1985) paper unified the theory and empirical measurement however, over the years various methods for estimation of discrete choice models {{were not used to}} measure the values of travel time. This thesis measures the value of travel time of the intercity transport users in CearÃ using four models: unstructured type McFadden and the other three, as proposed in Tuong and Hensher (1985 a) (Becker, and DeSerpa and Tuong Hensher via Taylor expansion). Additional to the traditional logit model, it estimates the same models using the methodology developed by Morikawa (1989) and simulated maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian to logit models like in Train (2003). The result indicates that it should use the estimation methods and different functional forms sparingly, because depending on the parameters obtained can be found values for travel time considerably different. On the other hand, the functional forms can be good for prediction. A choice of estimation methods such as enrichment suggests less distortion from standard model. A choice of functional form indicates the use the model of Becker or DeSerpa because of their small oscillation regardless of the estimation methods used. Already a combined choice of estimation method and functional form suggests Becker or DeSerpa with Simulated Maximum Likelihood estimation to obtain values of travel time and to forecasts. Economistas desde 1965 debruÃam-se sobre uma forma de como mensurar o valor do tempo. O trabalho de Tuong e Hensher (1985) uniu teoria ao empirismo, entretanto, com o passar dos anos os mÃtodos diversos de estimaÃÃo por modelos de escolha discreta nÃo foram utilizados para a mediÃÃo do valor de tempo de viagem. Esta tese mensura o valor de tempo de viagem dos usuÃrios de transporte intermunicipal no CearÃ utilizando de quatro modelos: nÃo estruturado tipo McFadden e os outros trÃs, conforme proposto em Tuong e Hensher (1985 a), para Becker, DeSerpa e a proposta de Tuong e Hensher via expansÃo de Taylor. Adicional ao modelo logit tradicional, faz-se estimaÃÃes das mesmas formas funcionais utilizando da metodologia desenvolvida por Morikawa (1989) e depois a de estimaÃÃes de mÃxima verossimilhanÃa simulada e bayesiana para modelo logit com fatores aleatÃrios apresentada <b>em</b> <b>Train</b> (2003). O resultado indica que se devem utilizar os mÃtodos de estimaÃÃo e formas funcionais distintas com parcimÃnia, pois dependendo dos parÃmetros obtidos, podem ser encontrados valores para tempo de viagem consideravelmente diferente. Por outro lado, as formas funcionais podem ser boas para previsÃo tal como discutido acima. Uma escolha entre mÃtodos de estimaÃÃo sugere o enriquecimento como o que menos distorce as estimativas do logit padrÃo. Uma escolha de forma funcional indica o uso do modelo de Becker ou do DeSerpa por conta da sua pequena oscilaÃÃo independentemente dos mÃtodos de estimaÃÃo utilizados.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBefore July 2011, all medical {{graduates}} chose their specialties for residency training {{prior to}} receiving a 1 -month postgraduate year 1 (PGY- 1) emergency medicine (<b>EM)</b> <b>training</b> in Taiwan. Therefore, the EM curriculum content may not correlate {{well with the}} chosen specialty. Accordingly, the PGY- 1 trainees might learn from their <b>EM</b> <b>training</b> differently depending on specialty. PurposeThis study explored {{the influence of the}} specialties of PGY- 1 trainees on their performance in the 1 -month <b>EM</b> <b>training</b> using workplace assessment tools. MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed the clinical performance of 183 PGY- 1 residents who underwent a 1 -month <b>EM</b> <b>training</b> program in the emergency department of a teaching hospital. Their performance was assessed using several mini-clinical evaluation exercises (mini-CEXs) and a single monthly global rating. We classified trainees into three groups based {{on the extent to which}} the specialty chosen reflected primary care. (Radiology, pathology, nuclear medicine, and anesthesiology reflected little correlation. Obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology, orthopedics, and urology reflected some correlation. Internal medicine, general surgery, EM, and family medicine had high correlation.) We analyzed the variation in the assessment outcomes between groups using Kruskal–Wallis test. ResultsSuccess in achieving learning outcomes in the emergency department was proportional to the degree of general practice of the specialty chosen. This trend was statistically significant for the mini-CEX domains of medical interviewing (p =  0. 028), clinical judgment (p =  0. 012), physical examination (p =  0. 001), professionalism (p =  0. 023), and clinical skills (p =  0. 001). Compared to the mini-CEX, the final monthly global rating showed no significant correlation between degree of learning and the trainee specialty. ConclusionThe success of PGY- 1 s in achieving learning outcomes after 1 -month <b>EM</b> <b>training</b> was correlated with the degree of primary care of the specialty.

Perceptions of SGL were identified from qualitative responses, and regression analyses were used to determine strength of association between quantitative outcomes. Results. Reported benefits of SGL included team building, simulation training, enhancement of procedural skills, and the opportunity to discuss opinions on clinical management.

AimThe {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the results of implementing the mini-CEX into the one-month postgraduate residency <b>training</b> in <b>EM.</b> Materials and methodsThis study is a retrospective review of mini-CEXs completed by ED faculty members from August 2009 to December 2010. All PGY- 1 residents enrolled in this study rotated through the one-month <b>EM</b> <b>training.</b> Each PGY- 1 resident received one week of trauma training and three weeks of non-trauma training. The clinical competencies of each PGY- 1 resident were evaluated with mini-CEXs, rated by a trauma surgeon and three emergency physicians (EPs). We analyzed the validity of weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and specialty training of ED faculties on observation time, feedback time and rating scores. ResultsFifty-seven ED faculty members (42 EPs and 15 trauma surgeons) evaluated 183 PGY- 1 residents during the 17 months of <b>EM</b> <b>training.</b> ED faculties with different specialty training provided similar assessment processes. Most competencies were rated significantly higher by trauma surgeons than by EPs. On the computerized mini-CEX rating, no data was missed and junior EPs rated all competencies significantly higher. The evaluators and PGY- 1 residents were generally satisfied with the computerized format. As compared to the first assessment, only some competencies of PGY- 1 residents were rated significantly higher in subsequent evaluations. ConclusionThe seniority and specialty training of ED faculty affected the mini-CEX ratings. The computer-based mini-CEX facilitated complete data gathering but showed differences for ED faculty with different levels of seniority.

This study of the UCT/SUN EM program investigated the backgrounds, perceptions, and experiences of its graduates. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. The study population was the 30 graduates from the first four classes in the UCT/SUN EM program (2007 - 2010). We employed a scripted interview {{with a combination of}} closed and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the thematic method of qualitative analysis. Results: Twenty-seven (90 %) graduates were interviewed. Initial career goals were primarily (78 %) to practice EM in a nonacademic clinical capacity. At the time of the interview, 52 % held academic positions, 15 % had nonacademic clinical positions, and 33 % had temporary positions and were looking for other posts. The three most commonly cited strengths of their program were diversity of clinical rotations (85 %), autonomy and procedural experience (63 %), and importance of being pioneers within Africa (52 %). The three most commonly cited weaknesses were lack of bedside teaching in the ED (96 %), lack of career options after graduation (74 %), and lack of preparation for academic careers (70 %). Conclusions: The lessons identified from structured interviews with graduates from Africa's first <b>EM</b> <b>training</b> include the importance of strong clinical training, difficulty of ensuring bedside teaching in a new program, the necessity of ensuring postgraduation positions, and the need for academic training.
