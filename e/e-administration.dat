40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the attitudes of high school {{principals}} toward the implementation of electronic administration (<b>E-administration)</b> in public schools in Kuwait. To collect data, the researcher used a questionnaire and employed a quantitative technique. The researcher distributed 135 surveys to all high school principals in public schools in Kuwait. The response rate reached 83. 7 %. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were conducted to analyze data. For each variable frequency and percentages were calculated. For all Likert-type scale variables, means and standard deviations were calculated. There was no statistically significant difference between respondents regarding all variables. However, the MANOVA analysis in the current study reported only one significant positive interaction between gender (male and female) and having ICDL (p-value= 0. 028). Positive response rates in terms of the advantages, the most important factors enabling the implementation and the main obstacles facing the implementation of <b>E-administration</b> were generally high and may reflect the readiness to implement <b>E-administration.</b> Results from this study may provide baseline information for implementing <b>E-administration</b> in Kuwait and the Middle East. This study suggests that governments and policy makers gradually implement <b>E-administration</b> through a well organized plan. Therefore, a well organized plan should include all factors that enable the implementation. Furthermore, the study recommends that policy makers should offer rich professional development regarding <b>E-administration</b> in order to raise the awareness and acceptance of <b>E-administration</b> implementation. Also, it is recommended that governments provide support, financial aid and more decentralization.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The Sedibeng District Municipality (SDM), {{according}} to its Integrated Development Planning Report 2009, is a Category C municipality established in the Gauteng Province. It is the only area of the Gauteng Province that is situated {{on the banks of}} Vaal River and Vaal Dam, covering the area formally known as the Vaal Triangle including of Nigel and Heidelberg. It includes the towns of Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark, Meyerton, and Heidelberg as well as the historic townships of Evaton, Sebokeng, Bophelong, Sharpville, and Ratanda, which have a rich political history and heritage. The SDM covers the entire southern area of Gauteng Province, extending along 120 km axis from East to West. The total geographical area of the municipality is 4630 square kilometers and the numbers of households living are 241223. In order to serve the communities, the municipality needs technologically advanced systems to deliver services efficiently. The study therefore focused on the implementation of <b>e-administration</b> for enhanced service delivery at SDM. The review of Sedibeng District Municipality Integrated Development Plan 2009 regarding service delivery does not indicate any statement recorded regarding e-government as the tool to help speedup service. According to SDM IDP, 2009 the Sedibeng District Municipality has other ICT initiatives such as the implementation of the CCTV in Vanderbijlpark CBD. While Sedibeng District Municipality Website 2009 states that the e-government will be implemented, even the Sedibeng District Municipality‘s website has outdated information. Other pages are still on development viz. visitors, business and residents. There is not much information on the clusters regarding their plans‖. In order to improve the challenge, the study hypothesized that ―lack of effective implementation of <b>e-administration</b> may lead to inefficient service delivery at Sedibeng District Municipality. The findings from the literature review and the empirical research support the central statement. Findings indicate that the SDM is aware regarding the significance of <b>e-administration.</b> The employees at the SDM are therefore receiving training from external service providers to enhance their expertise in the field of <b>e-administration.</b> The SDM needs to be aware and empower community members to understand the utility of <b>e-administration</b> for fast and convenient delivery of services. The SDM needs to invest in human resources to advance the service delivery through appointment of skilled and expert personnel. The adequate implementation of <b>e-administration</b> at the SDM level and the appropriate e-participation by the community members are the foundation blocks of improved and enhanced service delivery. The study recommends that SDM needs to appoint personnel advanced in technology; organize training sessions to enhance technological skills of existing employees on continuous basis; organize public participation forums for community members regarding the significance and utility of <b>e-administration</b> for improved service delivery; organize training sessions for community members to empower them with the technological means of participation; improve its website for the community members to log-in their requests; establish one-stop centres for the community members to utilize the <b>e-administration.</b> This is an imperative step as not all community members have access to computers and internet at home; deploy facilitators to train community members regarding the procedures of <b>e-administration</b> in their local language(s); and to improve on e-infrastructure in the form of establishment of kiosks in rural areas. This will assist geographically scattered community members to approach the municipal officials with ease The study recommends to further explore the concept of <b>e-administration</b> to combat bureaucracy and enhance transparency in the government processes in general and at the grass-roots level in particular.

40|$|AbstractThe paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the link between the}} actual level of <b>e-administration</b> at the county level in Romania and the educational system at the same level (I refer here especially to the education in the field of IT&C) in order to verify if there is a connection between those data. I will start from a previous research in which I radiographed the Romanian <b>e-administration</b> (January 2014), based on the Mark Holzer study a 1 qbout Digital Governance in Municipalities Worldwide. I will correlate it with data collected from all the Romanian ECDL centers (European Computer Driving Licence) knowing the fact that ECDL is an engine for what is called “intelligent citizen” (Stoica 2009). For having an accurate image on this topic I will look onto every county in Romania (41 in number) analyzing the official Web sites of municipalities as well as those from ECDL centers. The results I count on are a strong connection between education (on the field of IT&C) and a good <b>e-administration,</b> suggesting by this some new investments in the field of education. It is understood that the existence of Web platforms very well maintained doesn’t imply that they’re also used by the citizens or the business society. The new methods of administration don’t need only innovative solutions but also “intelligent citizens”. The value of this paper is the comparison itself. There are a lot of studies in Romania about the education, about the local administration but rare those studies are connected. More and more researchers stated that “education should come first”, so I suggest that before investing in IT platforms and so on, to invest firstly in education. It is not only the personnel of public administration that need to benefit from IT&C education, but also those to whom these platforms address (the citizens) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{state of}} the art {{literature}} about <b>e-administration</b> adoption (e. g Layne and Lee (2001)), claims that there is a process of adoption of IT, unfolded through several stages. Our hypothesis is that IT adoption, as much as any strong organizational and cognitive process, looks very much like a diffusion process with thresholds. Although the usage of computer is already well established, connectivity requires competences that are not acquired progressively. A trigger factor has to be present which provokes a cognitive and organizational alignment sometimes very spectacular in small municipalities. This makes the variegated usages of IT mutually reinforcing. We verify our theoretical hypothesis through a statistical analysis of an inquiry on local government in Brittany, focused on both e-government and <b>e-administration.</b> We end up with a typology which summarizes the pattern of usages by municipalities. The statistical study is complemented by a series of case studies on smallest municipalities which confirms the cognitive alignment hypothesis. While 50 % of Breton municipalities are barely using IT, and to some extent have not yet entered the maturation cycle, a significant group of small ones has a strong intensity of usage, contradicting a maturation cycle...|$|E
40|$|The e-Government {{label is}} used to frame several activities, such as e-Service, <b>e-Administration,</b> e-Voting, e-Participation, e-Democracy. Leveraging the e-Government “umbrella term” to refer to such set of e-activities (which {{may be viewed as}} sub-concepts of the general e-Government concept) {{highlights}} from one side the existence of several interrelated concepts {{and on the other side}} the lack of a well-defined and commonly-accepted conceptual framework to identify and classify e-Government implementations with respect to the several “e-Government sub-concepts”. e-Government can be portrayed as an empirical driven adoption, since all the e-Government sub-concepts share the exploitation of ICT to support (very) different government activities. In this paper, we classify e-Government projects according to sub-concepts. Since some public services may be classified both as e- Service and as <b>e-Administration,</b> while others can hardly be classified, the exploitation of a general term like e-Government allows for a classification according to stakeholder, relationship types, and Information System (IS) typologies. The investigated research question is whether such classification framework can improve the understanding of e-Government scenarios and can help e-Government project design, reengineering and evaluation activities by disambiguating the several involved e-Government sub-concepts. We use Services to Employment as a paradigmatic example of e-Government, due to their inherent nature and to our experience...|$|E
40|$|This study {{intends to}} provide a {{snapshot}} of the city government (in a developing country) as it uses information and communication technology (ICT) to transform its public service delivery and promote good urban governance. The volume of work related to services provided by local governments could be made more efficient, effective, transparent, accountable and equitable using relevant technologies. In the Philippines, a Government Information Systems Plan (GISP) was approved and adopted as framework for all computerization efforts of key services and operations. This study used as case study samples four city governments (Caloocan, Muntinlupa, Antipolo, and Tagaytay) known to actively use ICT applications to determine : (1) the level of use of ICT, and (2) how their computerization efforts facilitate good urban governance. The e-governance framework used for this study has a phased ICT utilization wherein a government agency must first use ICT to improve its internal operations (<b>e-administration),</b> then its public service delivery (e- government), before finally being able to use ICT to improve its relationship with its constituents (e-governance). The study was based on : (1) direct observations of their systems, (2) a review of their web sites, and (3) interviews with key officials whose positions corresponded to or were closest to a Chief Information Officer. The data was gathered from November 2003 to February 2004. Observations were finally assigned scores (using scales for each item), and analyzed along various components of e-governance. The results show two approaches among the cities in their development of ICT applications (1) Muntinlupa City was doing a pull to e-governance by emphasizing its web site rather than internal administrative applications, while the other three were doing a push towards e-government by developing specific administrative applications that are not immediately accessible via the Internet. No strong pattern can be detected among the four cities, but this can be expected since there was no common framework for their decisions to use ICT. All of the cities are concentrating on <b>e-administration</b> efforts. The city governments cited ICT for contributing to accuracy of records, increases in tax collection and other income, and improvements in efficiency, accountability, and transparency. Factors that may slow down ICT use for providing public service are the reported high costs to preparing a transactional website, and personnel issues over acquiring skilled employees and reducing staff turnover. Policy recommendations are : (1) emphasizing <b>e-administration</b> rather than website development to ensure that organizational processes exist to support public service delivery over the Internet; (2) city governments should develop their information policy; and (3) institute a system for identifying, anticipating and preventing problems and failures in local ICT investments. local governance, e-Government, <b>e-administration,</b> information and communication technology (ICT) ...|$|E
