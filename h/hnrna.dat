The size of <b>hnRNA</b> transcripts and the fraction of <b>hnRNA</b> that is converted to mRNA in cell lines, or groups of cells derived from a single cell of whatever one is studying, of Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes albopictus were compared. Both insects are dipterans, but Aedes has a larger genome than Drosophila. This means that Aedes has more DNA, which means more genes. The Aedes line make larger <b>hnRNA</b> than did the Drosophila line even though the two cell lines grew under similar conditions and produced mature or processed mRNA of the same size and sequence complexity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The hnRNP C 1 and C 2 {{proteins}} {{are abundant}} nuclear proteins that bind avidly to heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (<b>hnRNAs)</b> {{and appear to}} be involved with pre-mRNA processing. The RNA-binding activity of the hnRNP C proteins is contained in the amino-terminal 94 amino acid RNA-binding domain (RBD) that is identical for these two proteins. We have obtained the 'H, 13 C, and 15 N N M R assignments for the RBD of the human hnRNP C proteins. The assignment process was facilitated by extensive utilization of three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear-edited spectra. Sequential assignments of the backbone resonances were made using a combination of I 5 N-edited 3 D NOESY-HMQC, 3 D TOCSY-HMQC, and 3 D TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC as well as 3 D HNCA, HNCO, and HCACO spectra. Side-chain resonances were assigned using 3 D HCCH-COSY and 3 D HCH-TOCSY spectra. Four-dimensional I 3 C/I 3 C-edited NOESY and I 3 C/l 5 N-edited NOESY experiments were used to unambigously resolve NOEs. The overall global folding pattern was established by calculating a set of preliminary structures using constraints derived from the sequential NOES and a small number of long-range NOEs.

The RNA {{recognition}} motif (RRM), {{also known}} as the RNA-binding domain (RBD) or ribonucleopro-tein domain (RNP), was first identified in the late 1980 s when it was demonstrated that mRNA precur-sors (pre-mRNA) and heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (<b>hnRNAs)</b> are always found in complex with proteins (reviewed in [1]). Biochemical characterizations of the mRNA polyadenylate binding protein (PABP) and the hnRNP protein C shed light on a consensus RNA-binding domain of approximately 90 amino acids containing a central sequence of eight con-served residues that are mainly aromatic and posi-tively charged [2, 3].

50|$|Spliceosomes {{are a major}} {{component}} of an integral step in eukaryotic precursor messenger RNA maturation. A mistake in even a single nucleotide can be devastating to the cell, and a reliable, repeatable method of RNA processing is necessary to ensure cell survival. The spliceosome is a large, protein-RNA complex that consists of five small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and over 150 proteins. The snRNAs, along with their associated proteins, form ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs), which bind to specific sequences on the pre-mRNA substrate. This intricate process results in two sequential transesterification reactions. These reactions will produce a free lariat intron and ligate two exons to form a mature mRNA. There are two separate classes of spliceosomes. The major class, which is far more abundant in eukaryotic cells, splices primarily U2-type introns. The initial step of splicing is the bonding of the U1 snRNP and its associated proteins to the 5’ splice end to the <b>hnRNA.</b> This creates the commitment complex which will constrain the <b>hnRNA</b> to the splicing pathway. Then, U2 snRNP is recruited to the spliceosome binding site and forms complex A. U2 snRNP changes the conformation of the hnRNA-snRNP complex, exposing the nucleotide favorably for splicing. Following the conformation change, the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP complex binds to complex A to form the structure known as complex B. After rearrangement, complex C is formed, and the spliceosome is active for catalysis. In addition to this main spliceosome complex, there exists a much less common (~1%) minor spliceosome. This complex comprises U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac and U5 snRNPs. These snRNPs are functional analogs of the snRNPs used in the major spliceosome. The minor spliceosome splices U-12 type introns. The two types of introns mainly differ in their splicing sites: U2-type introns have GT-AG 5’ and 3’ splice sites while U12-type introns have AT-AC at their 5’ and 3’ ends. The minor spliceosome carries out its function through a different pathway from the major spliceosome.|$|E

When U1 snRNA genes were knocked out, genomic microarrays showed an increased accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA.

When other uridine based snRNAs were knocked out, this effect was not seen. Thus, U1 snRNA-pre-mRNA base pairing was shown to protect pre-mRNA from polyadenylation as well as premature cleavage.

Surprisingly, six C/D box snoRNAs and one H/ACA box snoRNA were expressed exclusively in brain. Of the 88 RNAs not belonging to either snoRNA subclass, at least 26 are probably derived from truncated heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (<b>hnRNAs)</b> or mRNAs. Short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) are located on five RNA sequences and may represent rare examples of transcribed SINEs. The remaining RNA species could not as yet be assigned either to any snmRNA class or to {{a part of a}} larger hnRNA/mRNA. It is likely {{that at least some of}} the latter will represent novel, unclassified snmRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Neuromuscular {{disorders}} such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neurodegenerative genetic diseases characterized {{primarily by}} muscle weakness and wasting. Until recently there were no effective therapies for these conditions, but antisense oligonucleotides, {{a new class of}} synthetic single stranded molecules of nucleic acids, have demonstrated promising experimental results and are at different stages of regulatory approval. The antisense oligonucleotides can modulate the protein expression via targeting <b>hnRNAs</b> or mRNAs and inducing interference with splicing, mRNA degradation, or arrest of translation, finally, resulting in rescue or reduction of the target protein expression. Different classes of antisense oligonucleotides are being tested in several clinical trials, and limitations of their clinical efficacy and toxicity have been reported for some of these compounds, while more encouraging results have supported the development of others. New generation antisense oligonucleotides are also being tested in preclinical models together with specific delivery systems that could allow some of the limitations of current antisense oligonucleotides to be overcome, to improve the cell penetration, to achieve more robust target engagement, and hopefully also be associated with acceptable toxicity. This review article describes the chemical properties and molecular mechanisms of action of the antisense oligonucleotides and the therapeutic implications these compounds have in neuromuscular diseases. Current strategies and carrier systems available for the oligonucleotides delivery will be also described to provide an overview on the past, present and future of these appealing molecules...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the role(s) of hnRNP proteins {{in the process of}} mRNA formation, we have identified and characterized the major nuclear proteins that interact with <b>hnRNAs</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. cDNA clones of several D. melanogaster hnRNP proteins have been isolated and sequenced, and the genes encoding these proteins have been mapped cytologically on polytene chromosomes. These include the hnRNP proteins hrp 36, hrp 40, and hrp 48, which together account for the major proteins of hnRNP complexes in D. melanogaster (Matunis et al., 1992, accompanying paper). All of the proteins described here contain two amino-terminal RNP consensus sequence RNA-binding domains and a carboxyl-terminal glycine-rich domain. We refer to this configuration, which is also found in the hnRNP A/B proteins of vertebrates, as 2 x RBD-Gly. The sequences of the D. melanogaster hnRNP proteins help define both highly conserved and variable amino acids within each RBD and support the suggestion that each RBD in multiple RBD-containing proteins has been conserved independently and has a different function. Although 2 x RBD-Gly proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms are conserved in their general structure, we find a surprising diversity among the members of this family of proteins. A mAb to the hrp 40 proteins crossreacts with the human A/B and G hnRNP proteins and detects immunologically related proteins in divergent organisms from yeast to man. These data establish 2 x RBD-Gly as a prevalent hnRNP protein structure across eukaryotes. This information about the composition of hnRNP complexes and about the structure of hnRNA-binding proteins will facilitate studies of the functions of these proteins...|$|R
