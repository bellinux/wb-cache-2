5|$|US 22 enters New Jersey from Easton, Pennsylvania on the Easton-Phillipsburg Toll Bridge {{over the}} Delaware River. It heads into Phillipsburg, Warren County as a four-lane {{undivided}} road {{maintained by the}} Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, eventually becoming a divided highway. East of the bridge, the westbound lanes pass through the bridge toll plaza, and the route has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Broad and Main Streets. From the previous exit, US 22 runs eastward as a brief limited-access road maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation that ends in an interchange with Morris Street and Hillcrest Boulevard. At this point, the route becomes at-grade Memorial Boulevard; a commercial four to six-lane divided thoroughfare with a wide median consisting of U-turn ramps and jughandles. The median narrows as the road forms the border between Lopatcong Township {{to the north and}} Phillipsburg to the south. The route fully enters Lopatcong Township and comes to an interchange with Route 57, with an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing the Route 57 junction, US 22 takes a southeasterly turn and passes over Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary before entering an agricultural area. The route forms the border between Pohatcong Township to the west and Greenwich Township to the east as it passes to the east of the Phillipsburg Mall.

The highway was rerouted to {{the eastern side of the}} river in 1929. By early 1941, US23 was rerouted to cross the Saginaw River on the southern side of Bay City, and the former routing along Washington Avenue and Midland Street through downtown was renumbered Bus.

US23, including connections along the former routing of M-47 southwest and M-20 west of Bay City, were redesignated as BL I-75. The BL I-75 designation lasted until 1971 when southern half of BL I-75 was removed, converting the business loop <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> spur; the southern section was renumbered as part of an M-84 extension, and BS I-75 would then run along the section concurrent with M-25 only.|$|E
