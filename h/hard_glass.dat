2500|$|In 1991 [...] "xenon headlamps" [...] were {{introduced}} for vehicles (BMW E32). These are actually metal-halide lamps; the xenon gas is used only {{to provide some}} light immediately upon lamp startup, as required for safety in an automotive headlamp application. Full intensity is reached 20 to 30 seconds later once the salts of sodium and scandium are vapourised by {{the heat of the}} xenon arc. The lamp envelope is small and the arc spans only a few millimetres. An outer <b>hard</b> <b>glass</b> tube blocks the escape of ultraviolet radiation that would tend to damage plastic headlamp components.

2500|$|Current-production burner {{categories}} are D1S, D1R, D2S, D2R, D3S, D3R, D4S, and D4R. The D stands for discharge, {{and the number}} is the type designator. The final letter describes the outer shield. The arc within an HID headlamp bulb generates considerable short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, {{but none of it}} escapes the bulb, for a UV-absorbing <b>hard</b> <b>glass</b> shield is incorporated around the bulb's arc tube. This is important to prevent degradation of UV-sensitive components and materials in headlamps, such as polycarbonate lenses and reflector hardcoats. [...] "S" [...] burners – D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S – have a plain glass shield and are primarily used in projector-type optics. [...] "R" [...] burners – D1R, D2R, D3R, and D4R – are designed for use in reflector-type headlamp optics. They have an opaque mask covering specific portions of the shield, which facilitates the optical creation of the light/dark boundary (cutoff) near the top of a low-beam light distribution. Automotive HID burners do emit considerable near-UV light, despite the shield.|$|E

6000|$|Maggie hesitated, however; {{she made}} no direct reply. [...] "It's useless hoping," [...] she {{presently}} said. [...] "She won't. But he ought to." [...] Her friend's expression of a moment before, which had been apologised for as vulgar, prolonged its sharpness to her ear-- that of an electric bell under continued pressure. Stated so simply, what was it but dreadful, truly, that the feasibility of Charlotte's [...] "getting at" [...] the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question? Strangest of all things, doubtless, this care of Maggie's as to what might make for it or make against it; stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability, on her own part, with her husband, of some direct sounding of the subject. Would it be too monstrous, her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks: [...] "Wouldn't it really seem that you're bound in honour {{to do something for}} her, privately, before they go?" [...] Maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit, capable of sinking to intense little absences, even while conversing, as now, with the person who had most of her confidence, during which she followed up the possibilities. It was true that Mrs. Assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balance--by not wholly failing to guess her thought. Her thought, however, just at present, had more than one face--had a series that it successively presented. These were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that Mrs. Verver might still look to. There was always the possibility that she WAS, after all, sufficiently to get at him--there was in fact that of her having again and again done so. Against this stood nothing but Fanny Assingham's apparent belief in her privation-- more mercilessly imposed, or more hopelessly felt, in the actual relation of the parties; over and beyond everything that, from more than three months back, of course, had fostered in the Princess a like conviction. These assumptions might certainly be baseless--inasmuch as there were hours and hours of Amerigo's time that there was no habit, no pretence of his accounting for; inasmuch too as Charlotte, inevitably, had had more than once, to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in Portland Place, been obliged to come up to Eaton Square, whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal. She didn't come to Portland Place--didn't even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in London. Maggie hated, she scorned, to compare hours and appearances, to weigh the idea of whether there hadn't been moments, during these days, when an assignation, in easy conditions, a snatched interview, in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes, mightn't perfectly work. But the very reason of this was partly that, haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased, she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image. The alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained, somehow extorted and cherished; and {{the difference between the two}} kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake. Charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy--she was hiding humiliation; and here it was that the Princess's passion, so powerless for vindictive flights, most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the <b>hard</b> <b>glass</b> of her question.|$|E
5000|$|Soft {{glass is}} {{sometimes}} useful because it melts at lower temperatures, however {{it does not}} react well to quick temperature changes like borosilicate glass does.

By extending the study to a 2 D soft disk model at zero temperature, the robustness of the power-law decay in sheared amorphous solids is underlined. Deviations from a power law occur when either reducing the packing fraction towards the supercooled regime in the case of hard spheres or changing the dissipation mechanism from contact dissipation to a mean-field type drag for the case of soft disks.

40|$|The {{yield stress}} is a {{defining}} feature of amorphous materials which {{is difficult to}} analyze theoretically, because it stems from the strongly non-linear response of an arrested solid to an applied deformation. Mode-coupling theory predicts the flow curves of materials undergoing a glass transition, and thus offers predictions for the yield stress of amorphous solids. We use this approach to analyse several classes of disordered solids, using simple models of <b>hard</b> sphere <b>glasses,</b> soft glasses, and metallic glasses for which the mode-coupling predictions can be directly compared to the outcome of numerical measurements. The theory correctly describes the emergence of a yield stress of entropic nature in <b>hard</b> sphere <b>glasses,</b> and its rapid growth as density approaches random close packing at qualitative level. By contrast, the emergence of solid behavior in soft and metallic glasses, which originates from direct particle interactions is not well described by the theory. We show that similar shortcomings arise in the description of the vibrational dynamics of the glass phase at rest. We discuss the range of applicability of mode-coupling theory to understand the yield stress and non-linear rheology of amorphous materials. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

50|$|For the {{creation}} of dies for producing jewelry and badges, or blanking and piercing (through use of a pancake die) by the coinage (stamping) process, the positive master may be made from sterling silver, since (with appropriate machine settings) the master is significantly eroded and is used only once.

40|$|The {{interphase}} {{region in}} dry and water aged polymer/glass fibre composite materials was investigated {{by means of}} the nano-indentation and the nano-scratch techniques. The indentations as small as 30 nm in depth were produced along 14 μm path starting from the matrix and ending on the fibre. This was done in order to detect water degradation of material properties in the transition region between the fibre and the matrix. The distinct properties of the interphase region were revealed by a sequence of two to three indents in dry materials and up to 15 indents in water aged, degraded materials. These results indicated interdiffusion of water into the interphase regions. The nano-scratch test results showed that the interphase region width increased and the material properties degraded during water aging. Doubts about the presence of the interphase, raised over the hardness results {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>harder</b> <b>glass</b> region, were refuted with the results showing the expansion of the interphase region during water aging.
