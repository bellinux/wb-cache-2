Two field experiments (a experiment was conducted at Wuwei in 2010 and another at Zhangye in 2014 in Gansu Province) were carried out to determine the effect of row spacing of <b>intercropped</b> maize on <b>intercropping</b> system production and growth of <b>intercropped</b> maize in two <b>intercropping</b> systems (wheat/maize and faba bean/maize). The experiments included 5 maize row spacing treatments (D 0 : 0 cm, D 20 : 20 cm, D 40 : 40 cm, D 60 : 60 cm, D 80 : 80 cm),the yield, agronomy traits and growth of <b>intercropped</b> maize were investigated. The results showed that there were no significant effects of row spacing of <b>intercropped</b> maize on yield of <b>intercropped</b> companion crops, row spacing change mainly affected the yield of <b>intercropped</b> maize; the yield of <b>intercropped</b> maize, the total yield of <b>intercropping</b> system and SP (system productivity) under D 60 in 2010 and D 40 in 2014 were the greatest in both <b>intercropping</b> systems. With increasing of row spacing of <b>intercropped</b> maize, SP increased firstly, and then decreased, a inflection appeared at D 60. The ear grain number, the 100 -grains weight and grain weight per plant were significantly affected by different row spacing treatments, the peak value was 132 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 60) in 2010 and 216 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2014 in wheat/maize <b>intercropping</b> system, and 158 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2010 and 220 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2014 in faba bean/maize <b>intercropping</b> system. The growth rate of <b>intercropped</b> maize during co-growth period was significant lower than those during single growth period, the growth rate under D 40 and D 60 was always greater than other treatments in any sampling period.

Its superficial root system and its resistance to atrazine residue make proso millet a good <b>intercrop</b> between two water- and pesticide-demanding crops. The stubbles of the last crop, by allowing more heat into the soil, result in a faster and earlier millet growth. While millet occupies the ground, because of its superficial root system, the soil can replenish its water content for the next crop.

50|$|The {{push-pull}} technology involves use of behaviour-modifying stimuli {{to manipulate the}} distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, agrobiodiversity, plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent <b>intercrop</b> such as Desmodium uncinatum (silverleaf) (push), with an attractive trap plant such as Napier grass (pull) planted as a border crop around this <b>intercrop.</b> Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces {{significantly higher levels of}} attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum. There is also an increase of approximately 100-fold in the total amounts of these compounds produced in the first hour of nightfall by Napier grass (scotophase), the period at which stemborer moths seek host plants for laying eggs, causing the differential oviposition preference. However, many of the stemborer larvae, about 80%, do not survive, as Napier grass tissues produce sticky sap in response to feeding by the larvae, which traps them, causing their mortality. Legumes in the Desmodium genus (silverleaf, D. uncinatum and greenleaf, D. intortum), on the other hand, produce repellent volatile chemicals that push away the stemborer moths. These include (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, semiochemicals produced during damage to plants by herbivorous insects and are responsible for the repellence of Desmodium to stemborers.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: Enhanced crop {{productivity}} by <b>intercropping</b> is commonly {{assumed to be}} driven by resource complementarity. However, relatively few studies have directly measured resource acquisition to assess potential mechanisms underlying enhanced performance of <b>intercropping.</b> Methods: A long-term field experiment with three P application rates (0, 40, 80 kg P ha− 1 yr. − 1) and four maize-based <b>intercropping</b> systems was used to assess P acquisition and P fertilizer recovery efficiency (PRE) for three consecutive years. To identify underlying mechanisms, the additive partitioning method was applied to determine complementarity (CE) and selection effects (SE) in P acquisition of <b>intercropping.</b> Results: Average P acquisition increased by 28. 4 % and 27. 6 % compared to their monocultures in faba bean/maize and chickpea/maize <b>intercropping,</b> respectively. However, P acquisition was generally not enhanced and even reduced in the last year in soybean/maize and oilseed rape/maize <b>intercropping.</b> Enhanced P acquisition was due to positive CE in faba bean/maize, and to positive CE and SE in chickpea/maize <b>intercropping.</b> Conclusions: Increased resource acquisition via CE and/or SE depended on the particular crop combination in <b>intercropping</b> systems. Application of the additive partitioning method to <b>intercropping</b> may help to identify underlying mechanisms of overyielding and carefully select crop combinations to enable more efficient resource use...|$|R
