40|$|The {{researchers}} identified nine {{patient handling}} tasks that place nursing staff {{at high risk}} for musculoskeletal injuries. An expert panel redesigned these tasks using new patient <b>handling</b> <b>technologies</b> and work practice controls. The key objective was to evaluate the biomechanical benefit of the redesigned tasks. Back and shoulder muscle activity, forces on the lumbar spine, shoulder joint moments, and perceived comfort were evaluated in a laboratory setting. Using objective and subjective data, 63 participants who performed the redesigned tasks were compared with 71 participants who used standard procedures. Objective data revealed significant improvement in five of the redesigned tasks, while staff subjectively rated four of the redesigned tasks as significantly improved. Nursing tasks can be redesigned to improve caregiver and patient safety using new patient <b>handling</b> <b>technologies</b> and work practice controls.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} preliminary {{remote handling}} and robotic concepts being developed {{as part of}} the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Yucca Mountain Project. The DOE is currently evaluating the Yucca Mountain Nevada site for suitability as a possible underground geologic repository for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. The current advanced conceptual design calls for the disposal of more than 12, 000 high level nuclear waste packages within a 225 km underground network of tunnels and emplacement drifts. Many of the waste packages may weigh as much as 66 tonnes and measure 1. 8 m in diameter and 5. 6 m long. The waste packages will emit significant levels of radiation and heat. Therefore, remote handling is a cornerstone of the repository design and operating concepts. This paper discusses potential applications areas for robotics and remote <b>handling</b> <b>technologies</b> within the subsurface repository. It also summarizes the findings of a preliminary technology survey which reviewed available robotic and remote <b>handling</b> <b>technologies</b> developed within the nuclear, mining, rail and industrial robotics and automation industries, and at national laboratories, universities, and related research institutions and government agencies...|$|R

The Chicago Games organizers managed to break even and create a meager profit. In contrast, the Montreal OutGames reportedly lost USD$4 million. The financial success of the Chicago games was announced a year after the close of the games. According to Kevin Boyer, the co-vice chair of Chicago Games Inc., the final total cash budget of the 2006 games was slightly over US$9 million. He reported that there were an additional, [...] "$13.2 million in barter and in-kind sponsorships which included, among other categories, media and marketing ($7.2 million), legal service, cash <b>handling,</b> <b>technology</b> consulting, and waived facility rentals." [...] The state of llinois provided a 1.4% of the cash budget through a $125,000 tourism grant. CGI managed to fill a budget gap of approximately $300,000 (3% of the cash budget). According to Boyer, this was accomplished, [...] "with additional fundraising from donors and sponsors, especially longtime Gay Games competitors and supporters Dick Uyvari and Joe LaPat, as well as negotiated reductions in expenses with some of our vendors."
