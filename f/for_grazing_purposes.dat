60|$|I {{wanted to}} begin with the {{interesting}} old French settlements of St. Genevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. Louis. There was only one boat advertised for that section--a Grand Tower packet. Still, one boat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable rack-heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for personal property, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her that she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are places in New England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty dollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good--the new crop of wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places. The companionway was of a dry sandy character, and would have been well suited for grapes, with a southern exposure and a little subsoiling. The soil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good enough <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>purposes.</b> A colored boy was on watch here--nobody else visible. We gathered from him that this calm craft would go, as advertised, 'if she got her trip;' if she didn't get it, she would wait for it.|$|E
60|$|By the {{war with}} Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen, {{territory}} almost equal in extent to that we already possessed. It was seen that the volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers to settle up the Pacific coast country. Their numbers, however, were scarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for {{the population of the}} important points of the territory acquired by that war. After our rebellion, when so many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they found they were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop of the villages, but wanted larger fields. The mines of the mountains first attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys and productive grazing and farming lands were there. This territory, the geography of which was not known to us {{at the close of the}} rebellion, is now as well mapped as any portion of our country. Railroads traverse it in every direction, north, south, east, and west. The mines are worked. The high lands are used <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>purposes,</b> and rich agricultural lands are found in many of the valleys. This is the work of the volunteer. It is probable that the Indians would have had control of these lands for a century yet but for the war. We must conclude, therefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good.|$|E
60|$|The natives here {{unanimously}} {{express their}} hopes and wishes {{that we should}} take possession {{of the country and}} become their masters. Our style of paying for everything we require has taken them entirely by surprise. It is altogether contrary to their experience. There is no doubt that they are extremely poor, and terribly ground down, and many of their very numerous vices are, to a certain extent, excusable upon this score. They are so poor that they will sell anything for dollars—their corn, their flour, their donkeys, their cattle, their wives, or their daughters. They are a terribly priest-ridden people. I should say that no people in the world pay such extortionate dues. The priests claim two-fifths of the gross produce; of the remainder one-third is claimed by the King; then comes the local chief: so that finally the unfortunate cultivator gets less than one-fifth of the crop he has raised. It is no wonder that the people are poor, and that in times of drought, or when the locusts sweep over the land, or the rebels, more destructive still, carry off crops and herds and flocks, famine stalks through the land. There is no doubt that our mastership would be an unmixed blessing to them, but it would certainly be the very reverse of advantageous to ourselves. From our landing at Zulla to the present time we have passed through a country more barren than any I ever traversed. Except <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>purposes</b> it is absolutely valueless. Here and there, in the valleys, are little patches of cultivation {{by the side of the}} streams; but in the whole two hundred miles we have passed through, looking east and west as far as the eye can reach, I do not think that we have seen, in all, five hundred acres of cultivated land. Taking the two hundred miles north and south by, say, ten miles east and west—in all, two thousand square miles—I would not take the fee-simple as a gift. I am not, of course, suggesting that the ground we have traversed is to be taken as a fair sample of Abyssinia. Unquestionably it is not so. It would be as fair to land in the north of England, and to skirt the sea-coast, keeping on the Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Welsh, and Cornwall hills, and then to pronounce England a sterile country. Still, by what we have seen, by the ranges of mountain-summits discernible everywhere in the far west, it is evident that a very large portion of Abyssinia is mere grazing-land; and it is probable that the valleys and low-lying plains, which are extremely fertile, would be unhealthy for European constitutions. Whatever ideas may have been entertained at one time as to our taking possession of a country so rich, so fertile, and so salubrious as this was represented to be, the experience of this expedition must have entirely dispelled this notion. The general aspect of the country is so bare, the fertile portions so distant from the coast, the roads so impracticable, that any idea of English colonisers settling here, as suggested by Mr. Dufton and others, is simply preposterous; and in addition to all this, a very large force would be required to keep a warlike and turbulent people in order. We see by the English papers that “A British Taxpayer” has been writing indignantly, demanding why two or three thousand men were not sufficient for this paltry business. If the British Taxpayer had been out here, he would not have asked such a question. British soldiers are by no means men to overrate difficulties, or to hold their enemies at higher than their real value. But the universal opinion here is, that we have not one man too many in the country. The tribes of Shohos on the sea-coast; the King of Tigre, who can summon 20,000 or 30,000 men to his banner; the fierce Gallas, through whom we have still to pass,—all these have been, and probably will be, friendly. But why? Simply because we are strong enough to keep them in order. No one doubts for a moment that if they thought that they were strong enough, they would fall upon us instantly for the sake of plunder. If the three thousand men who, according to this critic, would have been amply sufficient, could have been endowed with the agreeable faculty of going for three months without food, and if their horses had been similarly gifted, they would without doubt have been amply sufficient. Three thousand British soldiers, as long as they keep together in a compact body, could march from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope. But, unfortunately, men and animals who can go for three months without food are scarce in these degenerate days. Our experience here is that, with the exception of meat, no food whatever is procurable between Zulla and our present most advanced post, with the solitary exception of Antalo. Grain for the animals is almost as scarce. We have bought small quantities, indeed, at most of the stations, but we never get it for the first few days after our arrival. It is only after we have been at a place for a short time, and when the people find out how large a sum we pay for it, that they bring in even small quantities. Then the problem would present itself: these three thousand men must be fed. To be fed, they must carry supplies with them. These supplies must be conveyed upon baggage-animals. These baggage-animals must be fed. But there is no food to be obtained as they march on direct. Therefore, it is evident that dépôts must be formed, and these must be guarded; communication must be kept up, roads must be made to some extent, for there are many places perfectly impracticable for loaded animals. And so the three thousand men would be frittered all over the country, and would be harassed to death by overwork and watching, and it is certain they could never penetrate to Magdala. Has a “Taxpayer” ever read the history of the French campaign in Spain? Has he any idea of the number of hundred thousand men who marched into that country, and of the numbers who returned to France? A very small proportion of the deficit fell under British steel and lead. They were accounted for by the peasantry. They died, shot down upon baggage-guard, cut off when in search of provisions, surprised when in small parties, harassed to death by overwork. Such would have been the fate of three thousand men landing in Abyssinia. The people here are as brave as the Spaniards, the country is beyond all comparison more difficult, and the resources which, it offers to an invader are as nothing to those of Spain. Our force, as it is now constituted, is sufficient to overawe the country, and it is fortunate that it is so. For I say fearlessly, and there is not an officer here who would not support me in that opinion, that if the people were hostile, we could not even with our present force have ever hoped to reach Magdala. It would have been a sheer impossibility. A mere passive resistance, the driving away of flocks and herds, and the burning of the grass, would have brought us to a standstill at Senafe; while the bare idea of defending our communication, and guarding the enormous trains required for our march of three hundred miles through a barren, hostile, and most difficult country, is so supremely ridiculous as to be laughable. The experiment of the three thousand men, had it been tried, would have ended in a disaster such as, with the exception of Cabul, the British arms have never experienced, and it must afterwards have been retrieved with a force of three times the strength even of our present one, and at an expenditure which might have taught even the “British Taxpayer” that penny wisdom is an equivalent for pound foolishness.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:Italian {{ryegrass}} (Lolium multiflorum Lam) {{is one of}} {{the most}} cultivated temperate annual forage crop around the world. Despite that, there is little information about the process of stem elongation during its vegetative growth. This information would be useful <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> management <b>purposes.</b> Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the herbage accumulation and stem elongation rates in annual ryegrass pastures submitted to intermittent stocking. The experimental design used was a completely randomized 2 x 2 factorial with three replications. The treatments were defined by the combination of two pre-grazing heights (15 and 25 cm) associated with two post-grazing heights (4 and 8 cm). The herbage accumulation rates were higher in pastures with 25 cm pre-grazing associated with post-grazing heights of 8 cm. However, leaf production rate was only affected by post-grazing height, with higher values being recorded for stubbles heights of 8 cm, regardless of pre-grazing height. Stem elongation rates in annual ryegrass tillers increased rapidly when pastures reached around 18 cm, a condition where there was a relatively low competition for light, suggesting that; 1) pre-grazing heights of 18 to 20 cm in annual ryegrass could be used as a upper limit <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> management <b>purposes</b> whether the objective is to minimize stem contribution in accumulated herbage and 2) It seems that stem elongation is as inevitable process (independently of competition for light) and that this could be related to the necessary strength of stems, pseudostems and sheaths to support larger and heavier leaves...|$|R

30|$|The {{land policy}} was {{similar in the}} Derg regime too. The agrarian reform {{proclamation}} of March 1975 made all rural lands and its natural resources public property under {{the custody of the}} State. It also reaffirmed the State ownership of all pastoral lands, although it extends usufruct rights to pastoralists. Article 24 of the proclamation states that ‘as of the effective date of this proclamation, nomadic people shall have possessory rights over the lands they customarily use <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> or other <b>purposes</b> related to agriculture’.

3000|$|During {{the entire}} period the area under {{cultivated}} and settlement land increased persistently from 75  % (110, 678 ha) in 1957 to 92  % (134, 944  ha) in 1985 and 96  % (141, 887  ha) in 2005 (Table  2). The trends showed a consistent expansion of cultivated and settlement land over the four decades being analyzed (1957 – 2005). Accordingly, {{there was an}} increase of 17.89  % (24, 266  ha) between 1957 and 1985 and 4.89  % (6943  ha) between 1985 and 2005 (Table  3). As it was outlined by the participants of the focus group discussion, the relatively smaller change observed in this land use type during the 2005 study period was {{because of the fact that}} farmers were forced to abandon and leave the cultivated land <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>purpose</b> due to the declining of its soil fertility status. As the detection analysis results revealed this observed consistent expansion was attributed to the conversion of the wetland, shrub land, grass land and forest cover into cultivated and settlement land at different stages. For instance, between 1957 and 1985 the cultivated and settlement LULC category exhibited a net gain of 84  % of wetland, 81  % of shrub land, 78.6  % of grassland and 78  % of the forest cover, while cultivated and settlement land maintained about 95.9  % of the original size to remain under the same land use category (Table  4) similarly in the period between 1985 and 2005, the land under cultivation and settlement achieved a considerable net gain of 5.90  % (7974  ha) of which shrub land covered 3.07  % (4154  ha), forest land 1.66  % (2245  ha) and grassland 1.16  % (1575  ha) (Table  5). In the contrary, the conversion of cultivated and settlement land to the other LULC classes was relatively insignificant. Generally, throughout the study period (1957 – 2005) cultivated and settlement land cover increased by 21.99  % (31209  ha) with annual average rate expansion of 0.45  % (Table  3; Figs.  3, 4, 5) [...]...|$|R

50|$|Attempting to {{dislodge}} {{the components of}} a monopoly amongst western land speculators, the General Revision Act of 1891 helped to provide reform upon profitable market activities by speculating groups following its inception. Paul Wallace Gates, a notable U.S. land policy historian, describes how numerous western lands purchased in the late 19th century were being held not for settlement but <b>for</b> overextended <b>grazing</b> <b>purposes.</b> By paying less than a fixed allotment of 25 cents per acre purchased, wealthy speculators {{had the ability to}} acquire large plots with small resistance to competitors. Under these conditions, the sale of commodities such as minerals and timber goods could be sold at a price above marginal cost, thereby reducing quantity sold and boosting profits forwestern speculating individuals. The Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916 eventually came to pass in which a defined legal separation between surface and subsurface rights became a necessary step upon new land purchases. Under this act, resource commodity speculators hoping to profit off of the purchase of undervalued land investments faced a separate fee to acquire mineral reserves, for instance, on top of the active cost of land purchased. Elements of a land monopoly by wealthy speculators were eventually dampened by creating a domestic marketplace of increased government land and heightened private acquisition costs following the General Revision Act of 1891's first passing.|$|R

30|$|The {{decrease}} in livestock {{numbers in the}} 2009 / 10 dzud and the incomplete recovery in the two studied soums until 2013 led to a substantial increase of available pastureland for the remaining livestock population. The regional utilization patterns of pastureland are greatly influenced by the management strategies of Lh households who possess 55.5 % of the total regional livestock and dominate on qualitatively and quantitatively better pastureland (Altmann et al. 2016). On the other hand, especially Mh and Sh herders tend to live together in khot ail summer pasture settlements <b>for</b> cooperative <b>grazing</b> <b>purposes</b> and work-sharing. <b>For</b> the Tsunhal Nur (TN) pasture, Altmann et al. (2016) determined an average stocking density of 2.5 sheep units (SUs, herbivore animal of 45 -kg live weight) per hectare in summer 2014, whereas the median was only 1.6 SU/ha. Whereas Kazakh HHs kept on average 3.5 SU/ha on the summer grazing areas attributed to their use, the respective stocking density was 1.2 SU/ha for Uriankhai and 2.7 SU/ha for Torguud (Altmann et al. 2016). From remote-sensing-based biomass estimates in June 2014, these authors calculated an average offer of dry herbaceous forage mass of 424 to 1053  kg/ha per herd, with a median of 611 (Altmann et al. 2016). Together with a reduced rotation of herds between grazing areas within a seasonal pasture, and shortened distances of the daily grazing orbits (Jordan et al. 2016), pasture conditions may thus deteriorate easily (Tsui 2012) in specific areas.|$|R
