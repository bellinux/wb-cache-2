5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. <b>Hose</b> <b>lines</b> stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{efforts to}} confine and {{extinguish}} the fire, {{it continued to}} spread into the structure and ignited furniture in the showroom, growing more quickly than the few operating <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> could control. Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> continued. At 7:41p.m. the showroom area of the store experienced a flashover while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The flashover contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the flashover were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire. Several calls for help were made by trapped firefighters and efforts to rescue them were commenced. These efforts proved unsuccessful. By the time the fire was brought under control, nine Charleston firefighters had been killed.|$|E
25|$|Some fire engines have a fixed deluge gun, {{also known}} as a master stream, which directs a heavy stream of water to {{wherever}} the operator points it. An additional feature of engines are their preconnected <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> commonly referred to as preconnects. The preconnects are attached to the engine's onboard water supply and allow firefighters to quickly mount an aggressive attack on the fire as soon as they arrive on scene. When the onboard water supply runs out, the engine is connected to more permanent sources such as fire hydrants or water tenders and can also use natural sources such as rivers or reservoirs by drafting water.|$|E

25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E

50|$|The firefighters {{died after}} the fire, aided by strong winds, trapped {{them in the}} {{basement}} of the brownstone and prevented their colleagues from rescuing them. It has also been suggested that the 45-mile-per-hour winds which helped fuel the fire also triggered an explosion, which also trapped them in the basement. The precise reason the firefighters died after getting trapped remains unknown, but one proposed scenario involves the fire burning through their <b>hose</b> <b>line,</b> cutting off their ability to fight the fire around them.|$|R

The water spray damage was composed of many elongated streaks, less than 1 -inch in length and were grouped and oriented so that they resembled a spray pattern. This study also noted that it was evident that the water did not wash all of the deposited material away from the wall or ceiling surface because “the patterns had a color which was lighter than the surrounding area but not as light as a clean burn or protected area” (Shanley et al. 1997).|$|R
40|$|We had {{previously}} immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells using HPV 16 E 6 E 7 ORFs. In {{order to identify}} crucial genetic events involved during cell immortalization, the genomic profile of immortalization of five <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines</b> was analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. Our results showed that chromosomal imbalance was common in HOSE cells after immortalization. The common chromosomal imbalances identified in immortal HOSE cells are: + 19 q 13. 1 (5 / 5 lines), - 13 q 12 ∼qter (4 / 5 lines), + 5 q 15 ∼q 33 (3 / 5 lines), + 20 q 11. 2 ∼q 13. 2 (3 / 5 lines) and - 22 q 11. 2 ∼qter (3 / 5 lines). Other chromosomal imbalances, which were detected {{in two of the}} five immortal <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines,</b> included gains on chromosome 1 and 11 q 12 ∼q 13, and losses on 2 p, 4 q, 8 p, 10 p and 11 q 14 ∼qter. The chromosomal imbalances observed in HOSE cells before immortalization include - 8 pter∼p 11. 2, - 11 q 23 ∼qter, - 13 q 12 ∼qter and + 19 which may represent early genetic events during cell immortalization. The genomic profile was examined in one <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>line</b> (<b>HOSE</b> 6 - 3) at various stages of immortalization. The genomic profiles of HOSE 6 - 3 cells after crisis were largely stable. A few additional chromosomal imbalances were detected in the immortalized HOSE cells after an extensive culture period including + 11 pter∼q 23, - 15 q 23 ∼qter, and + 17 q 12 ∼qter. Identification of nonrandom chromosomal imbalance in immortalized HOSE cells may facilitate the identification of specific chromosomes harboring genes involved in the immortalization of human ovarian surface epithelial cells. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|Epidemiological {{data have}} implicated the {{pituitary}} gonadotropin {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) as both {{a risk factor for}} and a protective agent against epithelial ovarian cancer. Yet, little is known about how this hormone could play such opposing roles in ovarian carcinogenesis. Complementary DNA microarrays containing 2400 named genes were used to examine FSH-induced gene expression changes in ovarian cancer (OC) and immortalized normal human ovarian surface epithelial (<b>HOSE)</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Two-way t-statistics analyses of array data identified two distinct sets of FSH-regulated genes in HOSE and in established OC cell lines established from patients (OVCA cell <b>lines).</b> Among the <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines,</b> FSH increased expression of 57 % of the 312 genes and downregulated 43 %. In contrast, FSH diminished expression of 92 % of the 177 genes in the OVCA cell lines. All but 18 of the genes affected by FSH in <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines</b> were different from those altered in OVCA cell lines. Among the 18 overlapping genes, nine genes exhibited the same direction of change following FSH challenge, while the other nine showed discordance in response between HOSE and OVCA cell lines. The FSH-induced differential expression of seven out of nine genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene-specific antisense oligonuleotides (ODNs) were used to inhibit the expression of genes encoding GTPase activating protein (rap 1 GAP), neogenin, and restin in HOSE and OVCA cells. Antisense ODNs to neogenin and restin, but not an antisense ODN to rap 1 GAP, were effective in inhibiting OVCA cell growth, diminishing proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and increasing caspase 3 activities. Furthermore, the ODN to rap 1 GAP was further shown to be ineffective in altering migration properties of OVCA cell <b>lines.</b> <b>HOSE</b> cell proliferation was not affected by treatment with any of the antisense ODNs. In summary, gene profiling data reveal {{for the first time that}} FSH may exert different biological actions on OVCA cells than on HOSE cells, by differential regulation of a set of putative oncogenes/tumor suppressors. Specifically, neogenin and restin were found to exhibit proproliferation/survival action on OC cells...|$|R
