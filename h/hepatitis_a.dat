5|$|In 2010 (the {{last year}} for nationally {{reported}} figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, {{with the exception of}} both <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and B, where they were slightly over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the Russian Superleague, contracted <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced that head coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} in little more than a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
40|$|HSV <b>hepatitis</b> is <b>a</b> rare {{but often}} fatal cause of liver failure {{which tends to}} affect immunocompromised individuals. Early {{treatment}} with Acyclovir {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in HSV hepatitis making recognition of the condition critically important. Here, we present a case of HSV <b>hepatitis</b> in <b>a</b> young woman with Crohn’s disease on Prednisone, Azathioprine, and Infliximab. We discuss the clinical presentation of HSV hepatitis as well as the possible causes of <b>hepatitis</b> in <b>a</b> patient on these medications. This case helps demonstrate the importance of early clinical suspicion for HSV in undifferentiated fulminate liver failure. It is also the first reported case of HSV <b>hepatitis</b> in <b>a</b> patient on Infliximab, raising the possibility of HSV reactivation in patients on Infliximab...|$|R

5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> causes {{an acute}} illness {{that does not}} {{progress}} to chronic liver disease. Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in {{people who are at}} high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection could lead to liver failure. People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{the first}} {{clinical}} trials for the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> vaccine {{took place in}} Kiryas Joel, where 70 percent of residents had been affected. This disproportionate rate of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection was {{due in part to}} Kiryas Joel's high birth rate and crowded conditions among children, who bathed together in pools and ate from communal food at school. Children who were not infected with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> were separated into two groups, one receiving the experimental vaccine and the other receiving a placebo injection. Based on this study, the vaccine was declared 100 percent effective. Merck licensed the vaccine in 1995 and it became available in 1996, after which the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infection rate fell by 75 percent in the United States.|$|E

Viral hepatitis is caused by five different viruses (<b>hepatitis</b> <b>A,</b> B, C, D, and E). <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> and hepatitis E behave similarly: they are both transmitted by the fecal–oral route, are more common in developing countries, and are self-limiting illnesses that do not lead to chronic hepatitis.|$|E

25|$|The vaccine was {{introduced}} in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then, Bahrain and Israel have embarked on eradication programmes.

In China and the United States, the incidence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> has decreased by 90% since 1990.|$|E
25|$|Antibody {{therapy is}} also used to treat viral infections. In 1945, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> infections, {{epidemic}} in summer camps, were successfully prevented by immunoglobulin treatment.
