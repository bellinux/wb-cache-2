2500|$|After {{starring}} in an HBO Half Hour Comedy Special, Griffin {{had her first}} consistent public exposure in 1996, when she was cast as the acerbic colleague of Brooke Shields' title character on the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan. In 1998, Griffin starred in her first one-hour special, HBO's Kathy Griffin: A <b>Hot</b> <b>Cup</b> of Talk. She honed a comedy and television career that poked fun at her relatively modest place in the Hollywood hierarchy in a self-deprecating manner. She frequently appears in such self-consciously tacky projects as the reality show competition Celebrity Mole Hawaii, in which she won the 2003 edition after undergoing such experiences as walking over hot lava with her bare feet. She identifies her victory as the moment she became a [...] "D-list" [...] celebrity.|$|E

Ben Jonson wrote humor plays, where types were based on their humoral complexion.Methods of treatment like bloodletting, emetics and purges were aimed at expelling a surfeit of a humor. Other methods used herbs and foods associated with a particular humor to counter symptoms of disease, for instance: people who had a fever and were sweating were considered hot and wet and therefore given substances associated with cold and dry. Paracelsus further developed the idea that beneficial medical substances {{could be found in}} herbs, minerals and various alchemical combinations thereof. These beliefs were the foundation of mainstream Western medicine well into the 1800s.|$|R

500|$|The 1956 final was {{the second}} time that Birmingham had reached the showpiece match, having lost 2–1 to West Bromwich Albion in 1931.

They had won the cup twice previously (in 1904 and 1934), and had been beaten in the final three times (in 1926, 1933 and 1955). Though Birmingham had less pedigree in the competition, the press viewed them as favourites. The Daily Telegraph contrasted Birmingham's [...] "dazzling Cup run" [...] with the manner in which Manchester City [...] "scraped through", describing the Midlanders as [...] "firm favourites". Interviews with players were typically bullish in tone. Manchester City's Bobby Johnstone opined that [...] "Even an unbiased fan must regard Manchester City with favour", whereas Birmingham's Len Boyd gauged opinion quite differently: [...] "They say Birmingham City are the <b>hottest</b> <b>Cup</b> favourites since Wolves crashed to Portsmouth in 1939".|$|R

Yet, very few tea drinkers understand the physics and fluid mechanics involved in brewing {{a cup of tea}}. For the first assignment in Flow Visualization, the guiding physics and fluid flow associated with tea brewing were investigated. In doing so, visualization methods and photographic techniques were used to explore how a cup of tea can appeal to more senses than just taste. The intent was to capture the full scientific process as well as the beauty that goes into each cup of tea. In doing so, photographic editing was minimized to preserve the natural aspect of the image. Another goal of the image was to utilize a creative and original technique that hadn’t been used in any previous images from this class.
