5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gill tubes.|$|E

50|$|One of Saint Paul’s largest {{residential}} areas, the North End {{houses a}} number of businesses, schools, churches and parks. <b>The</b> neighborhood was <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s and 1880s south of Maryland Avenue, where Victorian-era homes were built on narrow lots. The neighborhood's northern half was <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s or later; the area along Wheelock Parkway was <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s.

5|$|The 1972 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{is one of}} five Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s not to have any major hurricanes, the others being 1968, 1986, 1994, and 2013. Although Subtropical Storm Alpha formed on May23, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic basin.

5|$|The 1990 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured the most named storms of any {{hurricane season}} at the time. During the season, 14tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean became named storms.

5|$|The 2010 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was one of}} the most active Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s since records began in 1851 in which nineteen named storms formed.

5|$|The 2013 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a below-average season, featuring the fewest number of hurricanes since 1982.

The major US contribution came from the work of Henry Nehrling and Theodore Mead, whose hybrids crossed with Dutch stock have produced some modern hybrids, although not matching the European strains.|$|E
5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E

5|$|Early Haifa is {{believed}} to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture. Under Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s-40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to <b>develop.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to <b>develop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E
