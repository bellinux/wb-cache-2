50|$|Bitcoin Group is a {{multinational}} bitcoin mining company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. The company was founded during 2014 {{as a result}} of a partnership between Sam Lee, Allan Guo and Ryan Xu. The company announced that it would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in October 2014, however it was delayed due to two stop orders from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Bitcoin Group is currently in the process of making a third attempt to list on the ASX through an IPO, it is expected to occur in January 2016 due to ASIC's request for an <b>Independent</b> <b>Expert</b> <b>Report.</b> The company maintains it is the first digital currency company in the world to IPO as it has avoided going through so-called 'backdoor listings' that have been undertaken by other listed digital currency companies.|$|E
40|$|Target {{firms in}} Australian takeovers are {{required}} to commission the preparation of an <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> in circumstances {{where there is a}} perceived conflict of interest with the bidder. As approximately half of these reports are prepared by firms with which the target has other business dealings, concern has been expressed over the quality of these reports due to the suggestion that such reports are provided at lower fees. We examine the 191 independent expert reports provided in all 649 Australian takeover bids initiated in the period 1990 to 2000 inclusive. Using an expert-fee model, we find that the fees for reports by experts with other business dealings with the target are not lower than those of unrelated experts. In addition, the results indicate that experts with other dealings with the target provide reports with a significantly smaller valuation range, consistent with these reports being of higher, rather than lower, quality. Our findings are inconsistent with the U. S. and New Zealand experience of prohibiting audit firms from providing valuation advice in takeovers. 16 page(s...|$|E

The Maudslay ML3 no 5 (FJ6154)of this period is now preserved. After testing several different buses they eventually chose AEC Regent and Leyland TD2 double deckers (delivered in 1931).As the councillors could not decide whether to replace the trams completely with buses, they commissioned a <b>report</b> from an <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> whose <b>report</b> was completed in April 1929.

The present study represents an attempt to describe cross-individual differences {{in the use of}} different MP strategies, allowing direct predictions on which strategies {{are more likely to be}} effective. Sixteen pianists were studied while memorizing piano pieces. Each subject memorized two pieces of comparable length and difficulty, one by MP and the other by Physical Practice (PP), on two different days according to standardized protocols. During MP subjects were free to apply any practice strategies they preferred except for physically playing a real piano (ecological approach). Practice and performances were video-documented; performances were judged by <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> raters. Participants <b>reported</b> their practice strategies in researcher-developed questionnaires. MP alone produced successful musical learning. MP, even combined with PP, produced poorer performance compared with PP alone. MP outcomes were significantly influenced by the strategies applied. These results directly impact on musicians’ daily schedule and managing of health-risk factors, since valuable performance results can be achieved by combining optimally designed mental practice with short physical practice focused on strengthening the internal representation of the piece...|$|R
40|$|A {{scheme of}} {{arrangement}} involving a regulated {{company and its}} shareholders is defined as an "affected transaction" in the Companies Act 71 of 2008. Although scheme of arrangements, {{which can be used}} to achieve a takeover of a company, are a common occurrence, the Act provides no definition of such schemes. The importance of knowing what actually constitutes a scheme of arrangement becomes apparent when it is noted that section 121 of the Actprovides that any person making an offer which if accepted would result in an affected transaction is obliged to comply with all the relevant reporting and approval requirements in the Act, as well as the Takeover Regulations, unless the Takeover Regulation Panel has granted an exemption. Giving effect to an affected transaction is prohibited, unless the Panel has issued a compliance certificate or granted an exemption. The article comments generally on the definition of a scheme of arrangement as an affected transaction, highlighting the elements of a scheme of arrangement. Specific consideration is given to transactions which include a re-acquisition by the company of its own previously issued securities and when such a re-acquisition on its own would be considered to be a scheme of arrangement and an affected transaction. Comment on the obligation to appoint an <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> to <b>report</b> on the scheme and the relevance, if any, of the solvency and liquidity of the company embarking on a scheme of arrangement is included. Finally, consideration is given to the need to have a scheme of arrangement approved by a special resolution and the potential exclusion of certain voting rights. The article exposes a number of difficulties with the interpretation of the applicable provisions and suggests that these need to be revisited by the legislature for clarification...|$|R
