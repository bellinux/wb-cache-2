5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested {{on top of the}} Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{instances}} where two separate stations {{share the same}} name: there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines and another Edgware Road on the Bakerloo line, and there is one Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another Hammersmith station on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines station at Paddington <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the main line station to the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines station, it is shown as a single station on the current Tube map. It has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past.|$|E

25|$|Arc Symphony was {{developed}} by Sophia Park and Penelope Evans using the game engine Twine. Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E
25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Bhojakata, with its King Rukmi, Vidura, the ex-prime {{minister}} of Hastinapur and younger brother to Dhritarashtra, and Balarama {{were the only}} neutrals in this war. Rukmi wanted to join the war, but Arjuna refused to allow him because he had lost to Krishna during Rumini's swayavar and yet he boasted about his war strength and army, whereas Duryodhana did not want Arjuna's reject. Vidura {{did not want to}} see the bloodshed of the war and was insulted extremely by Duryodhana, although he was the embodiment of Dharama himself and would have won the war for the Kauravas. The powerful Balarama refused to fight at Kurukshetra, because he was both Bheema's and Duryodhana's coach in gadhayudhdh (fighting with maces) and his brother Krishna <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditionally a boat is {{organized}} so that alternate rowers row on {{port and starboard}} (or strokeside and bowside), with stroke on port side (having their blade to their own right) (strokeside). This is sometimes reversed, so that stroke <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> (having their blade to their own left); such a boat is usually described as 'bow rigged'. This is often {{on the basis of}} the abilities of the available personnel, to allow putting an experienced starboard side (bowside) rower in the stroke seat, for example but it is the norm for UK coastal rowers where racing is done clockwise around buoys. The eight in the illustration at the top of this article is rigged strokeside. If the eight were bow rigged, the oar for the stroke (number 8) rower would be on the other side of the boat (bowside/starboard).|$|E

25|$|After {{passing through}} the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who {{does not want to}} let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole ("It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed"), {{referring}} to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

Another elderly man enters a room in the house where there is another girl. Throughout the video, various scenes of older men and younger women appear. Towards the end of the video, Berrabah, Buchanan and Range are shown standing outside in the dark. A car stops next to the trio and they enter it. In the last scene, an elderly man watches by as the car drives off. Avril Cadden from the Sunday Mail praised the video as [...] "great". Former group member Buena expressed her dissatisfaction with it, saying: [...] "I just saw a bunch of perverted men and paedophile guys". The video reached number eight on the UK TV airplay chart.|$|E
500|$|At Harvard, Lin {{was uncomfortable}} with the {{attention}} on his ethnicity as opposed to his performance.

Lin said this occurred at {{most if not all}} Ivy League gyms, but he did not react to it. [...] "I expect it, I'm used to it, it is what it is," [...] said Lin. The heckling came mostly from opposing fans and not as much from players. According to Harvard teammate Oliver McNally, a fellow Ivy League player once called Lin the ethnic slur chink. In January 2010, Harvard played against Santa Clara University at the Leavey Center, just 15 miles from his hometown of Palo Alto, California. Playing to a capacity crowd that included droves of Asian Americans wanting to see his homecoming, his teammates told him, [...] "It was like Hong Kong." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{formulated}} the relativistic, geometric {{version of}} the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out {{to be part of a}} more general quantity called the energy–momentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress (that is, pressure and shear). Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, conservation of energy–momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy–momentum tensor is divergence-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition—the covariant divergence of the energy–momentum tensor, and hence of whatever <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the equation, is zero— the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations: ...|$|E

Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her {{to do something and}} then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point."

The alula and primary coverts are blackish, while all other coverts are bright olive green. The underside of the wing consists of light grey feathers with a yellowish tinge. The shoulders, and upper tailbase are also bright olive-green, the under tailbase chestnut-colored, while the tail flight feathers are blackish with wide olive-green. The non-breeding plumage differs in the black of the head which turns olive green, mottled with dark grey, and the presence of a narrow yellow brow.|$|E
