25|$|In August 2009, after {{spending}} some time presenting on RTÉ Radio 1, {{it was announced that}} Fanning would be returning to RTÉ 2fm to present his evening weekday show in his old 19:00 slot. The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday so I never left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E
25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Bowie {{had this}} to say about his part of the film: [...] "They crammed me. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> my scenes in four or five days, because I was in rehearsals for the 1991 Tin Machine tour. I was there for only a few days." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Sydney radio {{a decade after the}} publication of Program for a Puppet, Perry spoke about learning more from the negative reviews for his first fiction book than the good reviews: ‘Some were a bit cranky; some were patronising,’ he said, ‘but they were all in some way instructive. One thought the writing was [...] "too high mileage." [...] Another spoke of a [...] "staccato" [...] style. I recall another mentioning that it was, at times, like a film script. One reviewer thought I had two good thrillers in one, which had merit. I did meld two big themes that may have been better separated. But you don’t really know what you are doing on a first fiction. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> the heavy research, [...] "forty ways to pick a lock," [...] that sort of thing.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Salk: [...] "My {{intention}} {{was to go to}} medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Lopez {{received}} a demo {{of a song}} called [...] "Big Booty", produced by Diplo, and was encouraged to record the track, with everybody indicating {{that it was the}} type of track she needed to do. However, Lopez claimed: [...] "Never in my life will I do a song called 'Big Booty', it would never happen," [...] explaining that she felt {{it was going to be}} a joke and the album was very important. After some reluctance, Lopez ended up writing the track and played the demo in her car to see if it would work. While playing some tracks in her car, with her twins, Lopez stated that they instantly loved that the track: [...] "As soon as they heard 'Big Booty' they went crazy. They loved this song and because of that I recorded it," [...] she admitted. During a brunch where she debuted multiple songs from A.K.A., Lopez spoke of the track, saying: [...] "I didn't allow myself to be put in a box. On this album, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> of it. This is who I am and i have to embrace all of that and be as honest as I can be." ...|$|E
