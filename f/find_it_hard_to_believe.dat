500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} {{has been reluctant}} to specify the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E
500|$|Three {{decades after}} Murrell's death, {{in the late}} 19th century, Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday, expressing {{the view that the}} area was [...] "still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect, costume, habits, and mode of thought". He learned about Murrell, and decided [...] "to write a story about him", believing that [...] "some might <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that such a man, {{practicing}} such arts and wielding such influence, could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London". The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine. It was Morrison's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and [...] "inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft".|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{was written by}} Justice Antonin Scalia, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. [...] "Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration," [...] Scalia wrote. [...] "We <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision." [...] Justice Scalia focused on the impact California's unconscionability law was having on arbitration clauses - since the rule was invalidating {{a large proportion of}} arbitration agreements, the rule must violate the policy in favor of arbitration. [...] Therefore, it was preempted by the FAA.|$|E
2500|$|That being said, {{there is}} {{consensus}} in late 20th century and early 21st century scholarship that the label 'nihilist' is misleading, {{in part because}} if his argument were genuinely meant to support nihilism it would be self-undermining. The argument, of course, is itself something, and has pretensions to communicate knowledge, in conflict with its explicit pronouncement {{that there is nothing}} and that it can't be known or communicated. Gisela Striker argues: [...] "I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that anyone should ever have thought that Gorgias seriously advocated the view that nothing is and that he was, therefore, a 'nihilist.' Similarly Caston states: [...] "Gorgias would have to be not merely disconsolate, but quite dull-witted, to have missed the conflict between his presentation and its content" [...] Finally, Wardy says, [...] "This sadly mistaken reading overlooks the most obvious consequence of Gorgias' paradoxologia (παραδοξολογία): his message refutes itself, and in consequence, so far from constituting a theory of logos, it confronts us with a picture of what language cannot be, with what it cannot be assumed to aspire to be." [...] Gigon and Newiger make similar points.|$|E
2500|$|Musically, {{the wind}} quintets {{represent}} {{a more conservative}} trend in Reicha's oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. [...] In the quintets, as he describes in his Preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, 'un-rationalised' flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys) and thereby the ambitions of amateur wind players by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial work like that available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). [...] His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life – many marches and 'walking' themes and, {{in the last two}} quintets, fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. [...] Four of the quintets have Trios in Passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. Berlioz says the quintets [...] "enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold", while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all, but excelling in the Minuets where this charge does not apply. Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): [...] ", the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer's intention" [...] (p. 56); of 's cor anglais playing he says (p. 23) [...] "However remarkable the singer...I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> she can ever have made it sound as natural and touching as it did on Vogt's instrument".|$|E
