5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices <b>for</b> <b>renewable</b> energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those <b>for</b> <b>renewable</b> energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

40|$|National polls reveal {{widespread}} public {{preference and}} willingness to pay more <b>for</b> <b>renewables.</b> ``Green pricing`` programs attempt to capitalize on these preferences and on an expressed willingness {{to pay more for}} environmental protection. This report explores the utility option of green pricing as a method of aggregating public preferences <b>for</b> <b>renewables.</b> It summarizes national data on public preferences <b>for</b> <b>renewables</b> {{and willingness to}} pay (WTP) <b>for</b> electricity from <b>renewable</b> energy sources; examines utility market studies on WTP <b>for</b> <b>renewables</b> and green-pricing program features; critiques utility market research on green pricing; and discusses experiences with selected green-pricing programs. The report draws inferences for program design and future research. Given the limited experiences with the programs so far, the evidence suggests that programs in which customers pay a monthly premium <b>for</b> a specific <b>renewable</b> electricity product elicit a higher monthly financial commitment per customer than programs asking for contributions to unspecified future actions involving renewables. The experience with green-pricing programs is summarized and factors likely to affect customer participation are identified...|$|R

5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support <b>for</b> <b>renewable</b> energy. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of {{renewable energy}} projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands.

40|$|In {{this article}} we show how {{different}} promotion schemes <b>for</b> <b>renewables</b> affect economic welfare. Our starting point is that external benefits of renewable electricity supply besides the abatement of greenhouse gases {{are not related to}} actual electricity generation but to producing and installing capacity. We argue that generation based subsidies such as feed-in tariffs and bonus payments can only be a second-best solution. Our model framework allows us to explain how these second-best instruments cause welfare losses in an environment of volatile demand. We postulate that capacity payments <b>for</b> <b>renewables</b> should be implemented in order to avoid unnecessary social costs...|$|R
