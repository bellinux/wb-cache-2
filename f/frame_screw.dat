40|$|Otologic surgery often {{involves}} a mastoidectomy, {{which is the}} removal of {{a portion of the}} mastoid region of the temporal bone, to safely access the middle and inner ear. The surgery is challenging because many critical structures are embedded within the bone, making them difficult to see and requiring a high level of accuracy with the surgical dissection instrument, a high-speed drill. We propose to automate the mastoidectomy portion of the surgery using a compact, bone-attached robot. The system described in this paper is a mill-ing robot with four degrees-of-freedom (DOF) that is fixed to the patient during surgery using a rigid positioning <b>frame</b> <b>screwed</b> into the surface of the bone.

50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing steel into semi-finished or finished goods at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as cold-rolled steel (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up sections and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber <b>framing</b> using <b>screws</b> to assemble stud frames.|$|R

50|$|The M1870 Gasser was a {{revolver}} chambered for 11.3×36mmR and {{was adopted by}} the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry in 1870. It was an open-frame model, with the barrel unit attached to the <b>frame</b> by a <b>screw</b> beneath the cylinder arbor. The arbor pin was screwed into the barrel unit and fitted into a recess in the standing breech. The cylinder was gate-loaded from the right side, and a rod ejector was carried beneath the barrel. A unique safety bar will usually be found on the right of the frame, below the cylinder. This carries pins which pass through holes in the frame to engage the lock mechanism. Slightly retracting the hammer allows one of these pins to move inward, preventing the hammer moving forward again when released. The pistol can thereafter be carried safely when loaded. Pressure on the trigger withdraws the pin from the path of the hammer before firing. The M1870 Gasser became the Austro-Hungarian cavalry revolver. It chambered a long 11.25mm centerfire cartridge which had earlier been used in Fruwirth carbines.|$|R
30|$|Telue and Mahendran (2002) {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} cold-formed steel frames {{to investigate the}} behavior of plaster cover plates in the wall of these frames {{and concluded that the}} load-carrying capacity of the studs of wall panels would significantly increase if brace and cover plates were used. Fülöp and Dubina (2004) tested three X-braced screw-connected wall specimens (3.6  m long ×  2.44  m high) under in-plane lateral loading. Of the three wall specimens, one was tested monotonically and two cyclically. The walls were constructed of a cold-formed steel <b>frame.</b> The <b>screw</b> connection configuration was selected to facilitate yielding {{along the length of the}} brace, i.e., to avoid net section fracture of the strap through the screw holes. Chord members were constructed of double stud members, such that inelastic deformations and ultimate failure of the walls would be limited to the braces. U profiles were placed in the tracks at corner locations to increase the hold-down capacity and rigidity. Local buckling of the lower track was observed during loading with damage being concentrated in corner areas. Plastic elongation of the strap did take place; however because of the unexpected failure of the corners, the results of the experiments may not necessarily reflect the true ductility of a braced wall if yielding (and failure) had been limited to the straps. Fülöp and Dubina suggested that the ideal configuration of the corners would be such that the uplift force is directly transmitted from the brace or corner stud to the anchoring bolt, without inducing bending in the bottom track. Failure to strengthen the corners can have a significant effect on the initial rigidity of the system and can be the cause of larger than expected in-plane shear deformations of the wall and premature failure of the braced frame.|$|R
40|$|Mirror shape {{accuracy}} {{as a key}} optical {{performance parameter}} for parabolic trough collectors can be assessed accurately by common measurement systems proving the high quality of state-of-the-art mirror panels. However, measurement results cannot always be compared directly because critical boundary conditions are not yet standardized. This paper quantifies the differences in shape accuracy results between the most common measurement setups for parabolic trough mirror panels and identifies measurement position, mounting mode and support frame employed for the measurement as relevant boundary conditions. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels of RP 3 geometry were performed at DLR’s QUARZ Center Cologne in vertical (mounting points vertically and curved direction horizontally aligned) and horizontal measurement position (mirrors facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support <b>frame</b> with <b>screws.</b> Finite element models were applied to calculate gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of support frame: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support frame with elastic brackets. The measurement results demonstrate that the difference in position and mounting mode can lead to relevant deviations of the shape accuracy results higher than {{the uncertainty of the}} employed deflectometric measurement system. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 7 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position was measured. Mirror shape specifications may thus not be applicable in all positions. Concerning the mounting onto different types of modeled support frame (in horizontal position) a variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) was calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support frame with elastic brackets...|$|R
50|$|Around 1993, an {{engineer}} and computer aided design (CAD) guru named Sandy Strayer joined Tripp Research, Inc. Tripp and Strayer revolutionized the 1911 market by designing a modular hi-capacity 1911 frame for IPSC shooters. While Para Ordnance already had a hi-capacity 1911 frame on the market, {{it was made of}} steel. The modular frame made use of a fiber-reinforced plastic which combined the trigger guard, grip, and integral magazine well. It used a proprietary grip which attached to the upper portion of the frame (a metal part that comprised the dust cover and frame rails). The result was that the modular frame weighed less than half of what the steel frame weighed. Further, while the Para frame feels notably larger than a standard 1911 in the hand, the STI feels similar to a regular 1911 since the grips are molded into the plastic of the <b>frame</b> rather than <b>screwed</b> to the outside. Tripp and Strayer were listed as the co-patent holders on the modular frame. Soon after the modular frame was introduced, the company name changed to STI (Strayer-Tripp, Inc.) and Strayer was given an equity stake in the new company.|$|R

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has gained}} increasing {{importance in the}} last years due to the introduction of High Strength Steels (HSS) to improve the strength-to-mass ratio of stamped components. Despite the advantages in terms of load decrease, springback reduction and increased formability, the elevated temperatures the tools are subjected to may determine severe thermal-mechanical cycling, increased oxidation and wear, which influence the tools service life {{and the quality of the}} produced parts. In addition, the frictional behaviour is also changing with temperature, thus affecting the performance of the forming operation itself.

40|$|Abstract. Development and {{application}} of composite materials in modern industry are very dynamic. Composite materials seem to be replacing steel and aluminium ones. Composites are a cheaper solution, with similar mechanical strengths. Generally, {{there are two types}} of joints in composite structures: mechanical and adhesively bonded ones. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of riveted joints in composites materials. Static tensile test method was used. In the test there was used one type of glass fabric (Interglas 92140) from which two types of composite samples were prepared. In each sample there was used the same type of fiber with the same fiber orientation – 3 layers. Samples had dimensions of 220 x 100 mm and thickness of approximately 1. 5 mm.

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support <b>frame</b> with <b>screws.</b> The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid support frames. The effect of angular deviations of the mounting pads is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented support frames is modeled: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support frame with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support frame with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the mounting pads mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid support frame show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith collector angle, respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory support frame allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the mounting pads is part of a complete optical mirror assessment. The data of standardized shape accuracy measurement serve for subsequent calculation of intercept factors and annual energy yields {{as well as for the}} evaluation of optimization approaches...|$|R
