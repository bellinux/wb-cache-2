In this study, the proton conducting polymer electrolytes were prepared by solution cast technique. Poly (vinyl chloride) PVC is used as the polymer host, ammonium triflate (NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃) as the doping salt and ethylene carbonate (EC) and butyltrimethyl ammonium bis trifluoromethyl sulfonyl imide (Bu₃MeNTf₂N) is used as the plasticizers. Characterization techniques of EIS, XRD, FTIR, FESEM, DSC, TGA, transference number and linear sweep voltammetry measurements were used to study the properties of the PVC based proton conducting polymer electrolytes. Pure PVC exhibits room temperature ionic conductivity of 1. 55 x 10 ¯¹⁰ S cm⁻¹. Various combinations of PVC and NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃ compositions were attempted and the highest conductivity achieved was 2. 50 x 10 ¯⁷S cm⁻¹ when 30 wt. % NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃ (A 4) was incorporated into PVC which is an increase of about three orders of magnitude, The increase in conductivity with addition of NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃ is attributed to increase in number of mobile ions and decrease in crystallinity of the films as shown by XRD, FESEM and DSC results. A further increase in ionic conductivity is observed when the polymer-salt electrolyte with the highest conductivity (A 4) was added with plasticizers EC and BU₃MeNTf₂N. The highest ionic conductivity achieved was 3. 06 x 10 - 5 S cm- 1 when 5 wt. % of EC (B 1) was incorporated to the A 4 polymer electrolyte. When 15 wt. % BU₃MeNTf₂N (C 3) was added to the A 4 polymer electrolyte, the highest ionic conductivity achieved was 1. 56 x 10 ⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹. Temperature dependence of conductivity study showed that conductivity increased with temperature and is found to obey the Arrhenius relationship. XRD studies showed that amorphous PVC becomes largely amorphous in nature upon addition of NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃. Largely amorphous in nature is also obtained upon addition of EC and BU₃MeNTf₂N to PVC- NH₄CF₃S 0 ₃. The degree of crystallinity, Xc is obtained by DSC and showed that the plasticized system has lower fraction of crystallinity compared to the salted systems with BU₃MeNTf₂N plasticized system having concentration of 15 wt. % (C 3) having the least crystallinity.

The author presents the operating principle of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and of its proton conducting membrane, respectively. Therefore, {{on the base of}} immobilization of imidazole, polymer materials with an intrinsic conductivity at temperatures greater then 373 K are synthesized. The concept of the polymer bounded <b>protonic</b> <b>solvent</b> is realized by means of polysiloxanes, surface modified nanoparticles of silica gel and oligomers of siloxane. Polysiloxanes are comblike polymers with covalently bounded imidazol {{at the end of the}} side chains. The oligomers have an identical structure in comparison to the polymers, but they have a lower molecular weight and are cyclic mostly. The nanoparticles are synthesized grafting with spacer units containing imidazole. All materials are characterized in the light of thermal behavior, stability, conductivity, diffusion and dielectric behavior. In order to examine the conductance and diffusion behavior, trifluoromethane sulphonic acid is used to provide the materials with protons as supplementary charge carrier. The flexible, glass formating oligomers and polymers have glass transition temperatures in the range from 272 to 314 K. The thermal stability of these materials reaches to 473 K. The pure, modified nanoparticles are not conductive. The conductivity of the oligomers and polymers depends on the glass transition temperature and softening behavior, respectively. With decreasing glass temperature, the flexibility of the system and the conductivity increase. Due to the immobilization of imidazole on the oligomer or polymer, the charge transport only is due to structural diffusion because no vehicle mechanism is possible. At a doping degree of 10 per cent, the doping of the materials increases the conductivity by a factor of 2. The addition of more acid does not influence the conductivity. The conductivity of the undoped materials only is due to charge carriers which rise from autoprotolysis of imidazole. According to the diffusion data, imidazole is immobilized at the oligomers. This is due to the negligible small self-diffusion of the oligomers. Therefore, the conductivity and the proton transfer are due to structural diffusion. A comparison of conductivity data and diffusion data using the Nernst-Einstein-relation yields only a very small part of diffusive protons which does not contribute to the conductivity. The mixture of nanoparticles and oligomer improves the mechanical properties. Above a certain mixing ratio, the conductivity of the oligomer does not depend on the mixture ratio. The consistency of the oligomer is variable in the range from brittle to leatherlike. The materials do not show any relaxation processes using dielectric spectroscopy. However, the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant can be determined graphically.

In the employed model J/ψ production in hadronic collisions is assumed to be a factorisable two step process: (i) production of a cc̅ pair which can be reliably described by perturbative QCD, and (ii) formation of J/ψ resonance from the cc̅ pair, which can be conveniently parameterized incorporating different existing physical mechanisms of color neutralization. We show that, for lower collision energies, J/ψ production through quark-anti-quark annihilation gives larger contribution at higher x_F, while gluon-gluon fusion dominates the production at smaller x_F. For proton-nucleus collisions the model takes into account both the initial state modification of parton distributions in nuclei and the final state interaction of the produced cc̅ pairs with the target nucleons.

The features of relaxation, associated to the glass transition, and of dc conductivity sigma(dc), determined from ac conductivity (sigma(ac) (f)) plots, were analysed <b>in</b> detail. <b>Protonic</b> conductivity is governed by the motion of the polymeric chains, however a decoupling between translational and rotational motion is observed, as the temperature decreases towards the glass transition temperature. Dc conductivity was found to decrease with increasing pressure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was: (A) To attempt to {{determine}} the oxidation state of polyaniline as synthesized by the conventional method, (B) To determine factors affecting the degree of 2 ̆ 2 doping 2 ̆ 2 (protonation) of polyaniline by the monomeric acid, HCl, (C) To investigate the doping of polyaniline using two novel approaches, namely: (1) self-protonic-acid doping by using polymeric acids as dopants and (2) chemical oxidative doping, (D) To study gas separation properties of polyaniline membranes. ^ The most significant results and conclusions are: (A) Volumetric analysis (employing TiCl 3) of polyaniline prepared by conventional procedures show that the polymer obtained is in a significantly higher oxidation state than the desired, assumed emeraldine oxidation state. When prepared in the absence of air (argon atmosphere) it is obtained in an oxidation state significantly lower than the emeraldine oxidation state. These observations suggest that some of the studies on polyaniline in which it was assumed to be in the emeraldine oxidation state may need re-interpretation. (B) The degree of 2 ̆ 2 doping 2 ̆ 2 (as measured by conductivity) by protonation of polyaniline (emeraldine base) depends not only on the pH of the dopant solution but also on {{the presence or absence of}} neutral salts such as KCl. Dissolved KCl (0. 5 M) increased the conductivity of the (dry) powder by ∼ 109 at pH ∼ 5, consistent with Donnan Equilibrium effects. (C. 1) The use of a polymeric acid such as polyvinylsulfonic acid results <b>in</b> <b>protonic</b> acid doping up to pH ∼ 9, at which value the HCl-doped polyaniline is completely undoped and is an insulator, consistent with Donnan Equilibrium effects. (C. 2) Chemical oxidative doping (by Cl 2) of polyaniline (leucoemeraldine base) has been demonstrated for the first time to give the same highly conducting polymer as that obtained by the non-oxidative (protonic acid) doping of emeraldine base. (D) Excellent separation of O 2 /N 2 and H 2 /N 2 gas mixtures by polyaniline membranes as reported by Reiss and Kaner (1990) has been confirmed. ...|$|R

An increase in iridium loading continuously decreased the Lewis and Brönsted acid sites and inhibited the formation of protonic acid sites induced by hydrogen. The formation of protonic acid sites induced by hydrogen was also confirmed by the formation of electron detected by ESR spectroscopy. Additionally for n-pentane isomerization, an increase in iridium loading decreased the yield of isopentane due to the inhibition in the formation of protonic acid sites via hydrogen spillover phenomenon.
