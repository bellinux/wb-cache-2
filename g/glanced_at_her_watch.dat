60|$|Louise <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{sat up in}} bed, {{and turned}} reproachfully toward Aline.|$|E
60|$|Violet <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> with {{an exclamation}} of dismayed annoyance. She leaned appealingly towards the croupier.|$|E
60|$|An idea {{suddenly}} darted into Nancy's brain. At {{first she}} looked aghast. Then {{she laughed and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|If {{by running}} after Frances Cecilia could have brought her back, Cecilia would have run. But a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> told <b>her</b> that Frances must already be halfway to Ashland. So {{she could only}} accept the situation.|$|R
60|$|A remorseful uneasiness {{appeared}} in her frank eyes. Mother seemed no worse, but if I only knew what strange fancies she had sometimes! Then Miss Haldin, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> declared {{that she could}} not stay a moment longer, and with a hasty hand-shake ran off lightly.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{steadily}} with grave deference, but as like to like, and {{the girl}} recognized this and what his words implied. She was, however, playing a game then, and another swift <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> showed <b>her</b> that she had little time in which to finish it.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> {{and made}} a note of the hour. Then she wandered off {{to one of the}} smaller drawing-rooms, and, to relieve a certain strain of which she was somehow conscious, she played the piano softly. In the middle of a nocturne of Chopin's the door was opened, and a young man was shown into the room.|$|E
60|$|When {{it began}} to get dark, she stood near the glass front of the veranda and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> She could see for some {{distance}} down the valley and knew that the smoke of a locomotive would spread in a dark cloud across {{the tops of the}} pines. The train was late, but there was no smoke yet. It was a long climb from sea-level at Vancouver Inlet and in winter the line was sometimes blocked. There was no obvious ground for alarm, but somehow she was worse afraid of Walters than before.|$|E
60|$|So {{at eleven}} o'clock she went upstairs, for once before {{when he had}} been out late and she had sat up he had been much annoyed; but after she got in bed she lay for hours {{listening}} for the sound of the wheels. At last she fell asleep and dreamed that Ned and her husband were standing {{at the end of a}} precipice grappling fiercely together in a life and death struggle. She was awaked at last by a knocking at the door; she <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> which hung above her head; it was but half past six.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stuff and nonsense," [...] said Mrs. Holt; [...] "women are {{superior}} to men, and it's our duty {{to keep them in}} order. And if we're really going to risk our lives in your automobile, Mr. Brent, you'd better make sure it's there," [...] she added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so restful here," [...] {{she said}} presently, [...] "and I can't {{tell you how}} much I have enjoyed our meeting, but alas!" [...] she added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> [...] "you see the time--and I am dining out. We will walk to Hyde Park Corner and you must find me a cab." ...|$|R
40|$|Brynn hurried {{along the}} sidewalk. She could hardly {{see through the}} slippery, foggy shadowy her way air that enveloped East Barnes Street. A fine rain still came down in a slow monotone, and nothing {{in the city of}} Wellington seemed to be dry at all. Brynn cast a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and quickened <b>her</b> steps, her green {{transparent}} raincoat crackling, as she hurried to catch the eleven o 2 ̆ 7 clock bus. Mr. Dwyer shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have kept her working so late on a night like this-...|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> It was {{not quite}} six o'clock. Mary Louise and the Colonel would not appear for breakfast for a good two hours yet and after breakfast they were all {{to go to the}} yacht. The hour was opportune, affording her time to visit poor Doctor Anstruther and return before her friends were up. Had Alora paused to give Janet's story more {{consideration}} she might have seen the inconsistencies in the nurse's statements, but her only thoughts were to learn her mother's secret and to show her sincere consideration for her kindly old friend.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she drew}} a low chair towards the stove, and once more the faint color crept into {{her face as she}} took up a note. It was laconic, and {{requested}} permission to call at the Grange, but Maud Barrington was not deceived, and recognized the consideration each word had cost the man who wrote it. Afterwards she <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> raised it with a little gesture of impatience to make sure it had not stopped, and sat still, listening to the moaning of the wind, until the door opened and Miss Barrington came in. She glanced at her niece, who felt that her eyes had noticed each detail of her somewhat unusual dress, but said nothing until the younger woman turned to her.|$|E
60|$|Lilian {{retained}} but a blurred {{impression of}} {{that part of}} the journey. They swept past climbing mule teams, and, sometimes on two wheels only, swung round many curves. Blinding clouds of dust rolled up, and, driven forward by the breeze from the Atlantic, whirled about them. There were odd gleams of light, and a howling of dogs, as white-walled dwellings swept by, then only the clang of iron on lava, and creaking of the vehicle to break the silence of the desolate hillside, until the driver howled again as they clattered into old-world Laguna, just sinking into early sleep. The carriage lurched over the cobbles, sparks blazed up, white walls and glimmering lattices raced by, and Lilian <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> as, while the lathered team swung into swifter stride upon the level, Laguna receded into the night. Branches of eucalyptus met above, the road was checkered with shadow, but it was straight and good, and the driver evidently meant to win the guerdon promised him.|$|E
60|$|Tuppence walked briskly along {{towards the}} Serpentine, first <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> It was nearly six o'clock. She remembered {{that she had}} had no tea, but felt too excited to be {{conscious}} of hunger. She walked as far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling infinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to follow Sir James's advice, and put the possible events of the evening out of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the temptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.|$|R
60|$|MISS HOWARD. I know it's hard {{your being}} the only one up the week since you've been here, {{with no one to}} talk to; but there's another patient due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. (With a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> wrist <b>watch.)</b> She can't be coming unless she got in on the last train.|$|R
60|$|It {{was already}} a little past the {{customary}} luncheon hour at the Carlton, and the restaurant was well filled. The orchestra had played their first selection, and the stream of incoming guests had begun to slacken. A young lady who {{had been sitting in}} the palm court for at least half an hour rose to her feet, and, <b>glancing</b> casually <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> made <b>her</b> way into the hotel. She entered the office and addressed the chief reception clerk.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of July 24, 1997, Bechtel told her husband, Steve, she was {{planning}} on running several errands in town after teaching a children's weight lifting class at the Wind River Fitness Center. She stopped at Camera Connection, a photo store near her home in Lander, Wyoming around 2:30pm after teaching her class. Following her time at the photo store, she stopped by Gallery 331, where she spoke to the gallery proprietor, Greg Wagner. Wagner noted that Bechtel seemed hurried, and repeatedly <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> during their conversation. Wagner's was the last confirmed sighting of Bechtel.|$|E
40|$|This conference papaer is not {{available}} through ChesterRep. Metaphorically, Storytelling {{can be used as}} an approach for personal or group development. The process of re-telling is particularly important in challenging practice, and shaping new practices. I offer a re-telling here in my own context of mass higher education. About how it could be? Moji <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> - she had a mentoring session at 2 pm with Tom. She put down the latest issue of a leadership journal, and re-focused and re-framed her mind on Tom's learning journey. She found it difficult as she was frustrated that her field was still so positivistic and deterministic - it didn't feel like it had changed much since she was at university. Tom had already completed two years of his Honours degree. As Moji looked over his profile, she wished she had done Tom's programme at university. Tom had decided the structure of his degree, decided the contents, and decided the title of it. It truly was his degree. Moji remembered his last project at work [...] . he had changed a workflow process in his department, using operations management theory, and wanted to know what impact it had made. It was fascinating. Tom had unleashed major controversy about thejjeoples' roles in that process - surely affected by the global economic crunch. He found it hard to deal with at the time [...] . his learning emerged way beyond operations management, into how to draw on personal strength and resource in personally tough times. His use of motivation theory was inspired. A knock at the door disrupts Moji's reflections [...] . Tom enters [...] . Moji and Tom talk like friends that haven't spoken for years; they clearly know each other's life histories. Tom then gets straight in to his ideas about his next inquiiy around change management. A natural progression from the last project [...] . 3 pm arrives, and Moji has to end the dialogue with Tom. She wants to be at the dialogue group. She won't say anything in the group, as usual, but she wants to be there in case the group wants her to action anything. It's a positive group, now, but they had a rocky start [...] . This paper visions the possibility of whole degrees through action inquires in a mass higher education system, and shares some of the lived opportunities and challenges this story holds, from practice across various UK universities. Questions will be asked of our practices, but new ones will be co-created...|$|E
60|$|She ceased, turning {{an eager}} face toward me, and I felt an old longing increase. It was the inborn {{love of a}} fertile soil--and that wide sunlit country seemed to call me, for {{my father had been}} the last of a long family to hold one of the {{extensive}} farms which with their crumbling feudal halls may yet be found in the remoter corners of Lancashire. Then, asking practical questions, I wondered as Grace Carrington answered, because, though she wore the stamp of refinement to her finger-tips, she knew all that concerned the feeding of stock, and the number of bushels that might be thrashed from an acre of wheat. I knew she spoke as one having experience, for I had been taught to till the soil, and only entered the cotton-mill when on my father's death it was found that his weakness for horses and his unlucky experiments had rendered it impossible that I should carry on the farm. So, while unobserved the sun sank low, I listened eagerly; until at last there was a sound of footsteps among the fern, and she ceased, after a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> But, like the grain she spoke of, drilled into the black Assiniboian loam, the seed had been sown, and in due time the crop would ripen to maturity.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Devine {{naturally}} saw {{the point}} of this, but while she considered her answer, Barbara, who had a good deal to think of, and scarcely felt equal to any further conversation just then, abruptly turned away. <b>Glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> she went straight to a room, {{from the window of}} which she could see the road to the depôt, for she knew the Atlantic express would shortly start, and she had not been told that Brooke was not coming back. Exactly what she meant to say to him she did not know, but she felt she could not let him go without, at least, a slight expression of her appreciation of what he had done. She knew that he would value it, and that it would go far to blot out the memory of past unkindness. He had certainly meant to jump the Canopus, and deceived her shamefully, which was far harder to forgive, for the realization {{of the fact that she}} had bestowed rather more than friendliness upon a man who was unworthy of it had its sting, but she scarcely remembered that now. He had, it appeared, since then, sacrificed his fortune and broken down his strength, and that, considering the purpose which she fancied had impelled him, went a long way to condone his offences.|$|R
60|$|I did not {{hesitate}} any longer. I rose to my feet, and crossed the space which lay between the two tables. As I drew nearer to <b>her</b> I <b>watched</b> the child's face. At first a flash of desperate hope seemed suddenly to illumine it; then a fear more abject even than before took its place as she <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion. She <b>watched</b> me come, reading without a doubt the purpose in my mind {{with a sort of}} fascinated wonder. Her eyes were still fastened upon mine when at last I paused before her. I leaned over the table, keeping my shoulder turned upon the man.|$|R
60|$|Sewell came in, and {{sat down}} {{opposite}} her across the hearth, and Grace <b>glanced</b> covertly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> little <b>watch</b> which hung upon the wall. Major Coulthurst was punctuality in itself, and {{she realized that she}} had about twenty minutes in which to do a good deal. Ingleby's devotion to her--and it was, perhaps, significant that she felt that was the best description of it--was evident; but there were points on which he was as unyielding and impervious to suggestion as a rock; while Sewell, with his more delicately balanced nature and wider grasp of comprehension, was, in <b>her</b> hands, <b>at</b> least, as malleable clay.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> a moment’s {{amusement}} softening his features.|$|R
60|$|Lady Anselman <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> august guest {{a little}} querulously.|$|R
60|$|His hostess {{flashed a}} {{significant}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband, who smiled.|$|R
60|$|Arnold <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{deliberately}} {{and back}} again at his hostess.|$|R
60|$|Mimi's soft shy <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> stalwart husband, was {{sufficient}} answer.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Annersly <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> shrewdly, for she fancied she understood.|$|R
60|$|Then Miss Kinnaird laughed {{softly as}} she <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> attire.|$|R
60|$|She felt {{rather than}} saw Julius throw a {{sideways}} <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fan <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a {{somewhat}} startled expression in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> to {{see what}} she meant, what she understood.|$|R
60|$|Violet <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion, {{and saw the}} {{amusement}} in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Clennam <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> son, {{leaning against}} one of the windows.|$|R
