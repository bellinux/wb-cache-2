5|$|In {{response}} to immediate practical concerns, the Christian Church {{was installed in}} Poland in its Western Latin Rite, an act that brought Mieszko's country into sphere of ancient Mediterranean culture. Of the issues requiring urgent attention, the preeminent one was the increasing pressure of the eastbound <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German state (between the Elbe and the Oder rivers) and its plans to control the parallel <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church through the archdiocese in Magdeburg, the establishment of which was finalized in 968.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Rijeka {{development}} master plan, {{devised by}} Rotterdam Maritime Group, specifies further expansion of port facilities by 2030, including {{the construction of}} a large container terminal in Omišalj on Krk Island, near the JANAF Omišalj oil terminal. The container terminal would increase the annual capacity of the port by 2.5million TEUs. The plan requires construction of a high performance railway to Zagreb and a rail link planned by Croatian Railways to the proposed island terminal. The new line entails building a new bridge to Krk Island in addition to the existing Krk Bridge. The plan also includes <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing terminals, and is estimated to require an additional US$150 million. Likewise, an <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liquid Cargo Terminal is planned, as well as an <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bakar Bay facility, where a car terminal is planned. The <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port, improvement of transportation links and the strategic partnership are aimed at establishing Rijeka as the largest container port on the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

In various, mostly fairly “singular” settings asymptotic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resolvent are deduced as the spectral parameter tends to the threshold zero. Furthermore scattering theory for pairs of two-channel Hamiltonians is established. As an application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resolvent, asymptotic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scattering matrix are derived as the energy parameter tends to the threshold zero...|$|R

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were {{allocated}} to rebuilding and repairing the existing system.

Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
