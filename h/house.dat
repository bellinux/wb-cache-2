40|$|<b>Housing</b> {{reform in}} urban China has {{introduced}} market mechanisms into a previously welfare-oriented <b>housing</b> system. Although microlevel {{factors such as}} household characteristics begin to shape <b>housing</b> behavior in urban China {{as is the case}} in the West, macrolevel constraints and opportunities defined by not only <b>housing</b> stocks and <b>housing</b> markets but also local government behaviors continue to be crucial. By studying <b>housing</b> choice in Beijing, Chongqing, and Jiangyin, I find that local governments in different cities behave differently in reforming the <b>housing</b> system, which in turn create different <b>housing</b> stocks and <b>housing</b> markets and thus lead to different patterns of <b>housing</b> behavior. A <b>housing</b> stock dominated by public <b>housing,</b> a tight <b>housing</b> market, and a conservative local government all encourage households to choose public <b>housing</b> and rental, {{as is the case in}} Beijing, while a diverse <b>housing</b> stock with affordable <b>housing</b> prices, and an aggressive local government often encourage households to choose private <b>housing</b> and homeownership, indicated by the case of Jiangyin. ...|$|R

30|$|Secondly, <b>housing</b> market {{conditions}} affect <b>housing</b> price contagion effects.

For this reason, <b>housing</b> prices {{are more susceptible to}} external shocks in countries with less <b>housing</b> supply elasticity.

40|$|The article {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} main topics in the sociological study of <b>housing</b> {{from the end of}} the Second World War to the 1980 s & distinguishes the following five: (1) <b>housing</b> systems & <b>housing</b> policy, (2) the relationship between social stratification & <b>housing</b> differentiation, (3) the relationship between the family & <b>housing,</b> (4) the relationship between <b>housing</b> & neighbourhoods, & (5) <b>housing</b> & architecture as components of culture. During this period the sociological study of <b>housing</b> was strongly influenced by the changes occurring in the <b>housing</b> situation. The post-war <b>housing</b> shortage in Europe & the state's heavy involvement in tackling this problem, along with the rapid rise in the importance of social <b>housing,</b> led to an emphasis on the study of <b>housing</b> systems, <b>housing</b> policy, the methodology of quantitatively measuring <b>housing</b> needs, & the role of the state in the <b>housing</b> sphere, with a heavy stress on the economic dimension of <b>housing</b> issues. A shift to qualitative research on <b>housing,</b> i. e. studying the relationship between the family & <b>housing</b> & the <b>housing</b> needs of the elderly & new families, occurred as the <b>housing</b> shortage declined. Culturally oriented <b>housing</b> research followed, as a response to the search for new identities & for genius loci. As <b>housing</b> has become commodified in Europe & social <b>housing</b> has almost disappeared over the past twenty-five years, there has been revival of the study of the social consequences of narrowly defined economic concepts of <b>housing</b> policy...|$|R
