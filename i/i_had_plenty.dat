500|$|Plans {{were made}} for Paynter to run {{additional}} races before the Breeders' Cup Classic in the fall. [...] His next race was the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 27, 2013. Shortly after his arrival at Del Mar racetrack in early July, Paynter was profiled on TV, showing that his usual temperament was back to normal, as the camera showed him attempting to nip Baffert. [...] Running {{for the first time}} on a different synthetic surface, Polytrack, in the grade 2 race, Paynter was the 3–5 favorite, and at 122 pounds carried the most weight. [...] After running close to the [...] pace and taking the lead in the homestretch, he lost by a half-length to a late-running horse, Kettle Corn, at the finish. Jockey Bejarano believed the polytrack surface was a factor in his loss. [...] "He never seemed comfortable out there, I felt like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of horse, but he just wasn't liking what he was doing... he didn't have enough at the end." [...] Nonetheless, purse money for his placing put him over one million dollars in lifetime winnings.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also found}} a {{striking}} contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to [...] "a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming". Beckford cited an interview [...] "representative of many" [...] in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was [...] "talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how {{the facts of the}} Bible could not be faulted".|$|E
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time to admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E

2500|$|The {{core of the}} Great Moravian {{army was}} a princely retinue {{comprising}} professional warriors, who were responsible for collecting tribute and punishing wrongdoers (družina). The družina consisted of members of aristocracy ("older retinue") and members of princely military groups ("younger retinue"). Some of its members formed a permanent armed guard for the prince, the rest were garrisoned at the forts in the castle system or at other strategic points. The družina was probably relatively loyal and provided stable support for the prince {{since there is no}} known record of any dissatisfaction with it or of any uprising. The permanent part of the army had an expressly cavalry character. The Great Moravian heavy cavalry emulated the contemporary Frankish predecessors of knights, with the expensive equipment that only the highest social strata could afford (a contemporary Arab traveller Ahmad ibn Fadlan reported that Svatopluk <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of cavalry horses). The overall size of the družina is estimated by Ruttkay to 3.000-5.000 men. In the case of larger mobilisation, cavalry was reinforced by additional smaller units recruited from the retinues of local magnates and from traditional communities (občina). The second element of the army [...] (pohotovosť) consisted of lower classes of free citizens who were not, in most cases, professional warriors. However, thanks to their large numbers and knowledge of the prevalent types of weapons they represented a serious military force. They played a decisive role, mainly in the defence of Great Moravian territory, their participation in wars of expansion was less common. The army was led by the prince or, in his absence, by a commander-in-chief called voivode. [...] The maximum size of the army is estimated at 20,000-30,000 men. [...] In case of external aggression, ordinary people participated on the defence and diversion actions. An important element of the defence of Great Moravia was a system of strong fortifications, which were difficult to besiege with the then prevailing forms of military organization. For example, a Frankish chronicler wrote with awe about the size of Rastislav's fortress ("firmissimum, ut feritur, vallum").|$|E

6000|$|... "But then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of time," [...] I said agreeably. [...] "And {{the real}} {{difficulty}} {{is to get}} the facts to face me. Dear me, if only, now, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some of Miss Bowater's brains." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The Campania, of course. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time. It {{was easy}} enough for those fellows to arrest me, {{but they never}} had a chance of holding me." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> time. Aunt Sally {{she stuck}} to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That we do, sir," [...] {{answered}} the woman, [...] "and if you 'll step inside I 'll {{give you a}} bowl, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> {{in the house that}} is newly made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at this moment," [...] said Lawrence, {{turning from}} the table. [...] "Unfortunately <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of leisure. Where will you sit?" [...] And {{he reached out}} his hand for a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{is a bad}} business. However, {{begin at}} the beginning, and tell the story your own way. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{time to listen to}} it, and the fuller you make it the better.” ...|$|R

6000|$|Brooke smiled {{somewhat}} drily, {{for it was}} not a {{very unusual}} question in that country. [...] "Nothing the police could lay hands on me for. I only quarrelled with my bread and butter. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of it at one time, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} detain you longer from your game, Cousin Charles. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> to do, {{with all the}} {{complaints}} as {{to the state of}} the ships, and the lack of stores and necessaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas," [...] said Ann, [...] "I have {{no longer}} an Army. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of brave officers, indeed, but no private soldier for them to command. Therefore I cannot conquer Ruggedo and win all his wealth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easily, sir. This room {{though none}} too {{comfortable}} is at your disposal. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> {{of work to}} do in another part of my house. No one will come in here. You will be quite undisturbed." ...|$|R
60|$|My duties around Widow Canby's place {{were not}} onerous, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of chance for self-improvement.

60|$|The next day, therefore, I {{took down}} the sign and painted out my inscriptions. It {{was a good deal}} of trouble, for my letters were fresh, but it was a rainy day, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time, and succeeded tolerably well. Then I gave Euphemia the black-paint pot and the freedom of the sign.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then what on earth's the use {{of holding}} out any longer," [...] he said. [...] "It is sheer stupidity. I suppose the Parisians think that, as they can't fight, they will at least show that they can starve. What is the weather like? I felt very cold last night though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{blankets}} on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You guard me well, friend Olaf," [...] she said, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "Why, any enemy, and Christ knows <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty,</b> could <b>have</b> cut you down before ever you {{knew that he was}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I {{find your}} {{conversation}} interesting I shall listen. If not, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> to think about," [...] she answered, {{leaning back in}} her chair, and watching the smoke from her own cigarette curl upwards.|$|R
6000|$|As usual Lord Tony's eloquence was {{not equal}} {{to all that}} it should have expressed. He blushed furiously and with a quaint, shy gesture, passed his large, well-shaped hand over his smooth, brown hair. [...] "I am not much, I know," [...] he {{continued}} with a winning air of self-deprecation, [...] "and you are far above me as the stars--you are so wonderful, so clever, so accomplished and I am nothing at all ... but ... but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of high-born connexions, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of money and influential friends ... and ... and Sir Percy Blakeney, who is the most accomplished and finest gentleman in England, calls me his friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are indeed}} a great blessing; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{occasion}} {{to make the}} most of them, when I was marching in the ranks of the 32nd Pioneers, on the way up to Chitral. Still, they came naturally enough, there; and I am bound to acknowledge that it is hard work, sometimes, to keep them up here." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{came home}} to quiet tea and a black kitten called Sweep, who lapped half my cream jugful (and yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty)</b> sitting on my shoulder,--and Life of Sir Walter Scott. I was reading his great Scottish history tour, when he was twenty-three, and got his {{materials}} for everything nearly, but especially for Waverley, though not used till long afterwards.|$|E
60|$|At first I was too indignant {{to be able}} {{to think}} of what I ought to do. Our post-time was late, and my head ached as if it would burst into pieces. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of leisure to rest and compose myself. When I got cool again, I felt able to take my own part, without asking any one to help me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{letters to}} write to Miles and to them all at home; and I am making {{a whole set of}} shirts and {{stockings}} for papa and the boys--it will spare mamma and Jeanie, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of time." ...|$|R
30|$|It’s {{all about}} {{building}} something and {{not about the}} money. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> of money and it comes and goes, but to create a culture and opportunities for talent, and an enterprise of lasting usefulness and value {{is what it is}} all about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am always}} so foolish about money," [...] she declared, [...] "so ignorant that I {{never know how}} I stand, but really I think that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>plenty,</b> and a hundred or two more or less for rent didn't seem to matter much." ...|$|R
