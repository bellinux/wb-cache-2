40|$|The successfulness of an {{experiment}} is largely determined by the precision of the results obtained. The precision and the efficiency with which work is done may often be increased by automation. At the present time all irrigation is done in rows across plots by the University of Nebraska corn research program. Planting and harvesting is done by hand because {{it is impossible to}} plant or combine across the rows by machine. The plots have been planted across the rows because it was assumed that there was more variation between streams of water than in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> within a replication. If no difference could be attributed to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation,</b> plots could be oriented with the rows and machine harvesting and planting would be feasible. In order to evaluate the practicality of automation, each of the component parts of the program were analyzed in terms of cost functions. Uniformity trials may be used {{to determine the extent of}} plot to plot variability and soil heterogeneity. In addition, they may be used to construct contour maps of soil fertility, to estimate the effects of plot size and shape, to study the efficiencies of various experimental designs, and to adjust yields of subsequent experiments conducted on the same plots. Uniformity trials may be conducted using a single variety or by using several varieties and {{an experiment}}al design which is successful in removing genotypic effects. The success of a uniformity trial is greatly enhanced by the care with which uniform field husbandry is administered (LeClerg, 1962). Soil heterogeneity is an important feature which cannot be easily regulated but can significantly change results in field work. Plot size and shape are dependent on soil heterogeneity and are therefore important considerations in any research program using field plots. It is important to know in what way soil heterogeneity affects experimental results if the most precise data are to be obtained. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimum plot size and shape for corn yield trials conducted under irrigated conditions on the Red Clover field at Lincoln, Nebraska, and to determine if there was any detectable difference in performance caused by the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> A secondary aspect of the experiment was the comparison of different methods of determining optimum plot size.

40|$|The Border Check {{method of}} irrigation, {{widely used in}} Australia and {{overseas}} for the irrigation of pasture crops, may {{be described as a}} method of applying water to land between parallel ridges or checkbanks. Under ideal conditions the land should have no cross slope between the banks, but there is usually a slope in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Water is admitted {{at the head of the}} strip or irrigation bay, and the flow is diverted when, in the operator's estimation, the ponded water will carry to the end of the strip without wastage. With experience it is possible to judge the cut-off point with considerable accuracy. Depending upon soil type and the natural slope of the ground, bays may be up to 1, 200 feet long; and 70 feet wide, with average dimensions of 600 feet by 30 feet. It is the purpose of this thesis to examine some of the factors influencing the movement of water down a border strip, and the infiltration of this water into the soil. It is hoped that such studies will lead ultimately to a more critical assessment of border check layout in relation to soil type, topography, etc., and that it may be possible to determine accurately the dimensions needed for efficient use of irrigation water in a particular case. That efficient irrigation is necessary is brought out by the fact that one inch of excess water passing down to the water table may raise it by as much as one foot (49). The major factors influencing the movement of water down a border strip are as follows :- (1) The infiltration characteristics of the soil. (2) The flow per unit width of border strip. (>) The slope of the land in the direction of flow. (4) The resistance of the plant cover to water movement. Minor factors involved include the soil and water temperatures, the salt content of the irrigation water, the head of water during irrigation, the turbidity of the water, the nature of the soil colloids, etc. Most of these, however, influence irrigation by their effect on the infiltration at a particular point. In the work reported upon herein an attempt has been made to evaluate the influence upon pasture irrigation of the infiltration characteristics of the soil, and the density of pasture cover.

In June 1979, the Ministry of the Interior (MINTER) assumed the power to authorize water use for irrigation.

In February 1986, the federal <b>irrigation</b> functions <b>of</b> MINTER were consolidated under the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> a special Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Irrigation</b> Affairs.
