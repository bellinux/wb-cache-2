We do not seem to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent comes closer than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E

In a January 2007 interview with PBS, Harris said, [...] "We don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for not believing in Zeus, {{which is to say}} we are all atheists in respect to Zeus. And we don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for not being an astrologer." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} the term atheist will be retired only when [...] "we all just achieve a level of intellectual honesty where we are no longer going to pretend to be certain about things we are not certain about".|$|E

Biologists <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for this very important problem; they call it bionomics, or ecology." [...] He said that [...] "Steinbeck's bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from Tortilla Flat, in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological Sea of Cortez, to his latest communiqués as a war correspondent in England." [...] He characterized In Dubious Battle as [...] "an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, and when you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from me, so too you have it from him.” [...] Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, {{painting}} and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that {{one can see the}} departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|Most Esperanto {{words are}} {{gender-neutral}} ("table", [...] "grass", etc.). However, Esperanto assumes the male gender by default in other words, mainly words dealing with familial relationships and some animals. These words {{can be made}} female {{with the use of}} the feminine suffix. In Ido there is no default gender for normal root words, and one simply adds the corresponding masculine or feminine suffix only when desired. For example, frato means [...] "brother" [...] in Esperanto, but [...] "sibling" [...] in Ido. Ido uses the suffixes -ino ("female", used as in Esperanto) and -ulo ("male", not to be confused with the same Esperanto suffix which means [...] "person"). Thus [...] "sister" [...] is fratino (the same as Esperanto), but brother is fratulo. [...] "Sibling" [...] and other gender neutral forms are especially difficult in Esperanto since Esperanto simply does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for such gender neutral forms. Esperanto does, however, have an epicene prefix that indicates “both sexes together”: ge-. Patro means [...] "father" [...] and patrino [...] "mother"; gepatroj means [...] "parents". In standard usage gepatro cannot be used in the singular to indicate a parent of unknown gender; one would say instead unu el la gepatroj, [...] "one (out) of the parents".|$|E
