5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> <b>landing.</b> Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{when the}} student is given {{permission}} to fly alone the instructor directs the student to fly three circuits of the traffic pattern each accompanied by a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> <b>landing.</b> [...] During the first circuit, the solo, the student's Flight instructor may supervise the student's performance from the ground, {{paying close attention to}} the approach and landing. Some instructors keep a radio handy, if there is one in the aircraft, in case the student pilot should need assistance or advice.|$|E
50|$|To {{practice}} {{take off}} and landing, a pilot would often fly many patterns, one after another, from the same runway. Upon each landing, depending on the runway distance remaining, aircraft and pilot capabilities, noise abatement procedures in effect, and air traffic control clearance, the pilot will perform either a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> <b>landing</b> (taxi to the runway beginning for subsequent take-off), a touch-and-go (stabilize in the landing roll, reconfigure the aircraft for take-off, and take-off without ever stopping the aircraft), or a stop-and-go (decelerate to a stop, then take-off from the remaining runway). In the U.S., when operating in a controlled airport a pilot can be cleared for the option, allowing any of the landing options above, or a rejected landing, at pilot's discretion.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The virtual reality {{technique}} of amplified head rotations {{was applied to}} a fixed-base, low-fidelity flight simulator enabling users to fly a visual flying circuit, a task previously severely restricted by limited field of views and fixed field of regard. An exploratory experi- ment with nine pilots was conducted to test this technique on a fixed-base simulator across three displays: single monitor, triple monitor and triple projector. Participants started airborne downwind in a visual circuit with the primary task of completing the circuit to a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> <b>landing</b> while having a secondary task of spotting popup traffic in the vicinity simulated by blimps. Data was collected to study effects on flight performance, workload and simulator sickness. The results showed that {{there were very few}} significant difference between displays, in itself remarkable considering the difference in display size and field of views. Triple monitor was found to be the best compromise delivering flight performance and traffic detection scores just below triple projector but without some peculiar track deviations during flight and a less chance of simulator sickness. With participants quickly adapting to this technique and favorable feedback, these findings demonstrated the poten- tial value of upgrading flight training devices and to improve their utility and pave the way for future research into this domain...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the present}} Greek <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> ( [...] , teleía) is romanized as a Latin <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> and encoded identically with the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in Unicode, the {{historic}} <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in Greek {{was a high}} dot and the low dot functioned {{as a kind of}} comma, as noted above. The low dot was increasingly but irregularly used to mark <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> after the 9th century and was fully adapted after the advent of print. The teleia should also be distinguished from the ano teleia mark, which is named [...] "high stop" [...] but looks like an interpunct (a middle dot) and principally functions as the Greek semicolon.|$|R
50|$|In an {{indicative}} {{compound sentence}} {{with the last}} part an independent clause that does not end in a <b>full</b> <b>stop,</b> the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is omitted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>stops</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used punctuation marks; analysis of texts indicate that approximately half of all punctuation marks used are <b>full</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> {{is placed}} between numbers that {{designate}} subdivisions of different levels. No <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is placed after {{the number that}} designates the final subdivision.|$|R
50|$|If a non-syntactical <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> {{is at the}} end of a sentence, it is not usual {{to append}} another <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> to it; however, doing so is not incorrect.|$|R
25|$|Some {{abbreviations}} {{are written}} without a <b>full</b> <b>stop,</b> such as names of currencies, cardinal and ordinal directions, country codes of cars, codes of country names, chemical, physical, mathematicals symbols, symbols of units, etc. The <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> can be omitted from abbreviations in encyclopedias, {{but they are}} to be explained in a legend. A <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is not used after abbreviations whose last element is a full word (e.g. uaz < ugyanaz ‘the same’).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Full</b> <b>Stop</b> (2012): <b>Full</b> <b>Stop</b> is {{the second}} thriller movie of Binita as major female antagonist. This movie earned so much fame for her acting {{potential}} but Fullstop was not as successful as her previous movie in box office.|$|R
25|$|Ordinal numbers {{written in}} digits take a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> (e.g. 3. sor ‘3rd line’). The <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is {{retained}} {{even before the}} hyphen that connects suffixes (e.g. a 10.-kel ‘with the 10th’). Dates are an exception to this rule, see below.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the 1980s, {{advertising}} copy writers began incorporating <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> in titles and other advertising. In the 1990s, the group Morning Musume (モーニング娘。) began using a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in its name, starting a fad for this usage. Other {{examples include the}} following: ...|$|R
50|$|Another example: {{when the}} spaces between words line up {{approximately}} above one another in several loose lines, a distracting river of white space may appear. Rivers appear in right-aligned, left-aligned and centered settings too, but {{are more likely to}} appear in justified text, because of the additional word spacing. Since there is no added white space built into a typical <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> (period), other than that above the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> itself, <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> only marginally contribute to the river effect.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> (kuten) {{is a small}} circle. In {{horizontal}} writing, the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> {{is placed}} in the same position as it would be in English, that is, at the bottom right of the preceding character. In vertical writing, it is placed immediately below and {{to the right of the}} last character, in a separate square if using genkō yōshi. (Note the difference in placement with the traditional Chinese <b>full</b> <b>stop,</b> which {{is placed in the}} centre of the square.) ...|$|R
50|$|The more {{prevalent}} usage {{in much of}} Europe, Southern Africa, and Latin America (with the exception of Mexico due {{to the influence of}} the United States), reverses the roles of the comma and <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> glyph, but sometimes substitutes a space for a <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In 1830 and in 1842 edd. {{the poem}} is in one long stanza, with a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in 1830 ed. after line 8; 1842 ed. omits the <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b> The name [...] "Claribel" [...] may have been {{suggested}} by Spenser ('F. Q.', ii., iv., or Shakespeare, 'Tempest').|$|R
50|$|Ordinal numerals are {{followed}} by a <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the middle}} period, the system {{seems to be}} developing. The use of a dash and a curved {{horizontal}} line is found. A lotus (flower) mark seems to mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b> There seem to be varieties of <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
50|$|Id. is an {{abbreviation}} {{where the}} last two letters of the word are not present; thus, it always takes a period (or <b>full</b> <b>stop)</b> in both British and American usage (see usage of the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in abbreviations). Its first known use {{dates back to the}} 14th century.|$|R
50|$|Goods {{vehicles}} were painted red oxide with white lettering {{and a white}} Staffordshire knot. The letters N.S.R with only two <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> were carried in small letters. From 1912 the letters were increased in size but changed to just N S with a central knot and no <b>full</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Western <b>full</b> <b>stop,</b> it {{is often}} used to {{separate}} consecutive sentences, rather than to finish every sentence; it is frequently left out where a sentence stands alone, or where text is terminated by a quotation mark instead. No extra space is left after a <b>full</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
60|$|Remark, again, how short the {{sentences}} are. Each {{is made up}} of a very few words, and followed by a <b>full</b> <b>stop,</b> that our minds may come to a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> likewise, and think over what we have heard before St. John goes on to tell us more.|$|R
25|$|All {{abbreviations}} {{of words}} where the last {{letter of the}} abbreviation corresponds to the last letter of the full-length word are abbreviated without a <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> in New Zealand English. Thus the abbreviation of Doctor is Dr and the abbreviation of Mister is Mr do not have <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> after them, as opposed to Dr. and Mr. in American English. Initialisms and acronyms such as USA and NASA (or Nasa), are also abbreviated without <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> in New Zealand English. This practice {{has been in place}} in New Zealand since the late 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is used {{after some}} {{abbreviation}}s. If the abbreviation ends a declaratory sentence {{there is no}} additional period immediately following the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> that ends the abbreviation (e.g. [...] "My name is Gabriel Gama, Jr."). This is called haplography. Though two <b>full</b> <b>stops</b> (one for the abbreviation, one for the sentence ending) might be expected, conventionally only one is written. In {{the case of an}} interrogative or exclamatory sentence ending with an abbreviation, a question or exclamation mark can still be added (e.g. [...] "Are you Gabriel Gama, Jr.?").|$|R

5000|$|In {{countries}} {{that use the}} comma as a decimal separator, the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is sometimes found as a multiplication sign; for example, 5,2 [...] 2 = 10,4; this usage is impractical {{in cases where the}} <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is used as a decimal separator, hence the use of the interpunct: 5.2 · 2 = 10.4. This notation is also seen when multiplying units in science; for example, 50 km/h could be written as 50 km·h−1. However, in all countries the <b>full</b> <b>stop</b> is used to indicate a dot product, i.e. the scalar product of two vectors.|$|R
