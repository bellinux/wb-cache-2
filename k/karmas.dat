5|$|Prakriti (nature or type of karma) – According to Jain texts, {{there are}} eight main types of karma which {{categorized}} into the 'harming' and the 'non-harming'; each divided into four types. The harming <b>karmas</b> (ghātiyā <b>karmas)</b> directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming <b>karmas</b> are: darśanāvaraṇa (perception-obscuring karma), jñānavāraṇa (knowledge-obscuring karma), antarāya (obstacle-creating karma) and mohanīya (deluding karma). The non-harming category (aghātiyā <b>karmas)</b> {{is responsible for the}} reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances, longevity, spiritual potential and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. These non-harming <b>karmas</b> are: nāma (body-determining karma), āyu (lifespan-determining karma), gotra (status-determining karma) and vedanīya (feeling-producing karma), respectively. Different types of <b>karmas</b> thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective <b>karmas</b> will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent <b>karmas</b> are determined by the nature of <b>karmas,</b> intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding <b>karmas</b> and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the <b>karmas,</b> according to which the fruition of some of the <b>karmas</b> may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

Padda <b>karma</b> is celebrated by the entire village.|$|R
2500|$|Players {{are awarded}} <b>Karma</b> points {{as a game}} progresses. In third edition and earlier, these points are usually added to a total called Good <b>Karma,</b> {{which can be used}} to boost {{attributes}} and skills. Skills that are already well-developed cost more Good <b>Karma</b> than skills which are undeveloped, which helps encourage specialized characters to become more flexible by spending Good <b>Karma</b> on weaker attributes. <b>Karma</b> also makes characters more powerful in general because every tenth (or twentieth for metahumans) point is added to the <b>Karma</b> Pool instead of Good <b>Karma.</b> The <b>Karma</b> Pool allows players to re-roll dice or [...] "purchase" [...] additional dice in certain situations. <b>Karma</b> can even be used to avoid certain death, at the cost of all Good <b>Karma</b> and <b>Karma</b> Pool points. In fourth edition, <b>Karma</b> Pool is replaced by a new attribute called Edge which can be used in most of the same ways as the third edition <b>Karma</b> Pool. Experience and character advancement is still tracked with <b>Karma,</b> although Good was dropped from the name as it no longer needs to be distinguished from the old <b>Karma</b> Pool.|$|R

5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa {{is quite different}} from what is commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser <b>karmas</b> than destruction of developed animals and <b>karmas</b> generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific <b>karmas.</b> Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E

Therefore, in the present one both creates new <b>karma</b> (P. navakamma) and encounters the result of past <b>karma</b> (P. kammavipāka). <b>Karma</b> in the early canon is also threefold: Mental action (S. manaḥkarman), bodily action (S. kāyakarman) and vocal action (S. vākkarman).|$|R

5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated {{motionless}} in a standing posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical <b>karmas,</b> including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E
25|$|The souls {{on account}} of {{accumulation}} of meritorious <b>karmas</b> reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit <b>karmas</b> are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their <b>karmas.</b> As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.|$|E
25|$|When ghātiyā <b>karmas</b> {{are totally}} destroyed, the soul attains kevala Jnana or omniscience. Liberation is {{guaranteed}} for such souls {{in the same}} lifetime as soon the aghātiyā <b>karmas</b> are exhausted in the due course.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, <b>Karma</b> can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the <b>Karma</b> level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the <b>Karma</b> level. During the game the player will encounter <b>Karma</b> moments, the <b>Karma</b> moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide <b>Karma</b> decisions. Completion of <b>Karma</b> awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the <b>Karma</b> level. The player is not locked into choosing either <b>Karma</b> path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. <b>Karma</b> also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil <b>Karma</b> or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good <b>Karma.</b>|$|R

25|$|Deluding karma (Mohanīya karma) – These <b>karmas</b> are an {{instrumental}} cause of destruction the soul's right belief and right conduct. Of all <b>karmas,</b> deluding karma {{is the most}} difficult to overcome. Once this is eradicated, liberation is ensured within a few lifetimes.|$|E
