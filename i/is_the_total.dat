5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of nucleons. This is {{much smaller than the}} radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Monthly average temperatures, {{rainfall}} and snowfall for four communities {{are shown in}} the attached graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, Gander {{the interior of the}} island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website. The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Copa Libertadores <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Total</b> 90 Ascente Libertadores, {{manufactured}} by Nike. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration.|$|E
