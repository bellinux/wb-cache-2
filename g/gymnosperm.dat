5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the <b>gymnosperm</b> Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported <b>gymnosperm</b> Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx, as a Yixian Formation dinosaur, is {{a member}} of the Jehol Biota, the {{assemblage}} of organisms found in the Yixian Formation and overlying Jiufotang Formation. The Yixian Formation is composed largely of volcanic rocks such as andesite and basalt. Between the volcanic layers are several beds of sedimentary rocks representing deposition in a lake. The freshwater lake strata of the Yixian Formation have preserved a wide variety of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. <b>Gymnosperm</b> forests were extensive, with a few early flowering plants as well. Ostracods and insects were diverse, and bivalves and gastropods were abundant. Mammals and birds are also well-known from the formation. The setting was subject to periodic mortality events including volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and noxious gases erupting from the lakes. The climate has been interpreted as temperate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The yearly temperature during this time period averaged about , indicating a temperate climate with unusually cold winters for the generally warm Mesozoic era, possibly due to northern China's high latitude during this time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gymnosperms</b> {{have major}} {{economic}} uses. Pine, fir, spruce, and cedar are all examples of conifers {{that are used}} for lumber, paper production, and resin. Some other common uses for <b>gymnosperms</b> are soap, varnish, nail polish, food, gum, and perfumes.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{generalized}} impressions sometimes advanced about the decline and decrease of the <b>Gymnosperms</b> through the enormous {{development of the}} Angiosperms in the Cretaceous and their rapidly accelerated development in the Tertiary, it must be realized that this impression is confusing as far as Coniferales are concerned. It is of course a truism that the <b>Gymnosperms</b> are completely outnumbered in genera and species by the Angiosperms, the latter occupying terrain earlier beset by <b>Gymnosperms.</b> It must be realized, however, that possibly the almost entirely woody <b>Gymnosperms</b> did never {{have the potential for}} producing such immense numbers of genera and species as now found among the Angiosperms. This statement is also valid for the Coniferales...|$|R
40|$|Accessory {{costs of}} {{reproduction}} frequently equal or exceed direct investment in offspring, and can limit {{the evolution of}} small offspring sizes. Early angiosperms had minimum seed sizes, {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than their contemporaries. It has been proposed that changes to reproductive features {{at the base of the}} angiosperm clade reduced accessory costs thus removing the fitness disadvantage of small seeds. We measured accessory costs of reproduction in 25 extant <b>gymnosperms</b> and angiosperms, to test whether angiosperms can produce small seeds more economically than <b>gymnosperms.</b> Total accessory costs scaled isometrically to seed mass for angiosperms but less than isometrically for <b>gymnosperms,</b> so that smaller seeds were proportionally more expensive for <b>gymnosperms</b> to produce. In particular, costs of abortions and packaging structures were significantly higher in <b>gymnosperms.</b> Also, the relationship between seed:ovule ratio and seed size was negative in angiosperms but positive in <b>gymnosperms.</b> We argue that the carpel was a key evolutionary innovation reducing accessory costs in angiosperms by allowing sporophytic control of pre- and postzygotic mate selection and timing of resource allocation. The resulting reduction in costs of aborting unfertilized ovules or genetically inferior embryos would have lowered total reproductive costs enabling early angiosperms to evolve small seed sizes and short generation times. 11 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. <b>Gymnosperm</b> plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E

50|$|The <b>gymnosperms</b> and {{angiosperms}} together {{compose the}} spermatophytes or seed plants. The <b>gymnosperms</b> {{are divided into}} six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct.|$|R
25|$|In <b>gymnosperms,</b> the ovule is not {{contained}} in a carpel, but exposed {{on the surface of}} a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of <b>gymnosperms</b> in question. Two main modes of fertilization are found in <b>gymnosperms.</b> Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube.|$|R
25|$|At the P–Tr boundary, the {{dominant}} floral groups changed, with many groups of land plants entering abrupt decline, such as Cordaites (gymnosperms) and Glossopteris (seed ferns). Dominant <b>gymnosperm</b> genera were replaced post-boundary by lycophytes—extant lycophytes are recolonizers of disturbed areas.|$|E
25|$|All {{gymnosperms}} are woody plants. Their stems {{are similar}} in structure to woody dicots except that most gymnosperms produce only tracheids in their xylem, not the vessels found in dicots. <b>Gymnosperm</b> wood also often contains resin ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. oak, maple and walnut. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as pine, spruce and fir.|$|E
25|$|The {{meristem}} architectures differ between angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes. The <b>gymnosperm</b> vegetative meristem lacks organization into distinct tunica and corpus layers. They possess large cells called central mother cells. In angiosperms, {{the outermost}} layer of cells divides anticlinally {{to generate the}} new cells, while in gymnosperms, the plane of division in the meristem differs for different cells. However, the apical cells do contain organelles like large vacuoles and starch grains, like the angiosperm meristematic cells.|$|E

25|$|Germination is {{the process}} by which an {{organism}} grows from a seed or similar structure. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or <b>gymnosperm.</b> In addition, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the spores of hyphae from fungal spores, is also germination. Thus, in a general sense, germination {{can be thought of as}} anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.|$|E

25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination.

The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers.
