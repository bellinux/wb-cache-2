5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman <b>irrigation</b> <b>network</b> in Spain.

5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex <b>irrigation</b> <b>network</b> in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and analyze the factors affecting farmers’ attitudinal dimensions toward participation in Water Users’ Association (WUA) by comparing two groups of farmers in <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> with WUA and without it. The methodological approach was a descriptive-correlational and causal-comparative study of the survey type. The target population in the study consisted of 2551 farmers of <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> in Khorasan-e-Razavi Province, Iran. Using stratified random sampling technique, 335 participants were chosen. Data were collected through a questionnaire, and analyzed using SPSS, V. 13. Content and face validity of the instrument were obtained by the faculty members of Agricultural Extension and Education, Agronomy and Irrigation Departments at Tarbiat Modarres University and also specialists board of Agricultural Jihad Organization and Regional Water Joint-stock Company in Khorasan-e-Razavi Province. The reliability analysis was conducted and cronbach’s alpha values for the various sections of instrument were estimated between 0. 73 and 0. 86. The descriptive findings of the study showed that the majority of farmers’ overall attitude with respect to participation in WUA was at a good level. The results obtained from Pearson correlation analysis indicated that there are significant and positive relationships between such variables as education level, size of irrigated cultivated landholding, annual income, extension contacts, social capital components, water users’ perceptions regarding <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> status and farmers’ participation status concerning <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> management with the farmers’ overall attitude toward participation in WUA. The result of stepwise multivariate regression analysis indicated that 61. 1 % (R 2 = 0. 611) of the variance in farmers’ attitudes with respect to participation in WUA could be explained by farmers’ behaviour regarding optimum farm water management, social participation, social confidence, water users’ perceptions regarding <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> status, farmers’ participation status concerning <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> management.

5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate <b>irrigation</b> <b>network.</b> Rice cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was grown extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was grown as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>network.</b> In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E

These constructions contributed immensely to the improvement of agriculture in the northern and eastern parts of the dry zone. Reservoirs were also constructed using tributaries of the Daduru Oya during this period, thereby supplying water to the south western part of the dry zone. This conservation and distribution of water resources ensured that the water supply was sufficient throughout the dry zone.

2500|$|Bones of {{the higher}} cranium grow in {{response}} to expansion of cerebral mass, {{in such a way}} that brain tissue and blood vessels mold the inner brain case. Endocranial casts of fossil skulls allow approximating brain vascularisation. Dean Falk noticed that a single large vessel, the occipital marginal sinus, was responsible for irrigating most of the brain in early australopiths (Australopithecus afarensis, Paranthropus robustus and boisei). The vessel grew smaller with time to be progressively replaced by a network of small veins in later hominins, starting with Homo habilis and continuing well into Eurasia. She interprets the change as an adaptation to cool the brain, which she uses to advance her [...] "radiator theory" [...] for accelerated encephalisation from Homo habilis onwards.

Since the Heian period, a number of irrigation networks have been built, for example Ryūda-segi, Nuru-segi, Toba-segi and Iida-segi. These networks are still in service.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study Place and Duration of Study: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the aforementioned <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> in the Khuzestan province between January of 2008 and October of 2009. Methodology: Using the simple random sampling technique, 278 farmers (26, 70 and 128 farmers from the Zohreh-Jarrahi, Maroun and Gotvand <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> respectively) were chosen. This sample comprised of 258 males and 20 females, aged 16 - 87 years old. The theoretical framework {{of the present study was}} based on the key aspects of the health belief model (HBM), later completed by adding a few other effective variables. The data were then analyzed by the multivariable technique, using SPSS software. Results: The findings of this study indicate that the key aspects of the health belief model significantly predict the farmers’ water management behaviors. In other words, understanding the advantages and barriers associated with the preservation of water resources influences the farmers’ water management behaviors through affecting their attitudes. Furthermore, existing attitudes towards water management practices in thereat, understanding the barriers associated with the preservation of water resources, and last but not least, perceived susceptibility against threats to water resources, all directly influence the farmers’ water management behaviors. Access to information regarding advanced water management techniques in the farm is another variable included in the theoretical framework used for this study, playing a key role in predicting the farmers’ management attitudes and behaviors. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates a successful and clear application of the health belief model to water management in the farm using a few other significant variables, while enhancing the HBM for application to other issues related to the preservation of environmental resources.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to design pressurized branched <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks.</b> This method is called recursive design {{and is based}} on application of the problem-solving technique known as backtracking to the problem of the optimum design of pressurized branched <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> with a known delivery piezometric head (pipe-sizing). Recursive design is a heuristic optimizer, like genetic algorithms, and has been implemented in a fast, versatile computer application. After presenting and precisely defining the design problem, the writers review the theoretical foundations of some of the main existing design methods: maximum velocity, recommended velocity, Mougnie velocity, constant hydraulic slope, Lagrange multipliers, linear programming, Labye's method, and genetic algorithms. Next, the writers explain what recursive design consists of and apply its methodology in detail to a simple network. In the results section, the solutions obtained by recursive design are compared with those obtained by the other design methods, giving satisfactory results. For example, in an analyzed standard network, genetic algorithms take more than 20 minutes to offer a solution, whereas recursive design offers a cheaper solution with less than 3 seconds of computation time.
