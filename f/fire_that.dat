Despite Hardy's attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff viciously attacked him during a promo where Hardy implied that he was also responsible for the <b>fire</b> <b>that</b> burned down Jeff's house, {{going so far as to}} reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff's dog, Jack (who perished in the <b>fire),</b> <b>that</b> he claimed to have salvaged from the wreckage of the house. At WrestleMania XXV, Hardy defeated Jeff in an Extreme Rules match, and in a stretcher match on the following episode of SmackDown.|$|E
