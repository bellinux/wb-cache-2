5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|Yet, {{when asked}} what he liked about Youkilis, former Boston scout Matt Haas said: [...] "At first glance, not a lot. He was unorthodox. He had an extreme crouch—his thighs were almost {{parallel}} to the ground. And he was heavier than he is now. But the more I watched him, the more I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Throw the tools out the window. This guy can play baseball.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

Here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots.

5000|$|Apple {{said that}} with the song, she wanted to explore {{different}} moods and the [...] "ups and downs" [...] of a relationship. [...] "When {{you get to the}} middle the song, that spell of confusion takes you out of the element for a minute, which is, of course, what happens emotionally. But the beat never changes." [...] Apple said the song is [...] "really <b>just</b> <b>thoughts</b> that were running through my head that were in that rhythm".|$|R

500|$|While {{fronting}} the band, Dickinson {{also came}} across Iron Maiden {{for the first}} time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; [...] "I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'This is really me. Not Samson.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it wasn't {{right for}} me. As a team, {{we were playing}} great and you don't want to disrupt things like that. Individually, I {{was not ready to}} accept that {{responsibility}} quite yet. Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. I understand {{there is going to be}} a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls. Gish later noted that [...] " [...] gave me a tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer." [...] Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was kind of}} much like [...] character to appreciate that." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{had fallen}} in quite early with this freak of {{speaking}} and thinking as if he and she were all mankind. It was as if her mind had been prepared for it by her own eager exploration in Europe. [...] "My friend, the philosopher," [...] he had said, [...] "will not have it that we are really the individuals we think we are. You must talk to him--he is a very curious and subtle thinker. We are <b>just</b> <b>thoughts</b> in the Mind of the Race, he says, passing thoughts. We are--what does he call it?--Man on his Planet, taking control of life." ...|$|R

500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato says, [...] "I {{had a lot}} {{of respect}} for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where she was really amazing and wasn't trying to be sexy or {{anything}} like that." [...] About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she was a great role model. She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything like that. I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented." [...] Lovato's The Neon Lights Tour was [...] "inspired by Beyoncé." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written by Jules Shear, and included on his 1983 debut solo album, Watch Dog. Shear later recalled in an interview, [...] " [...] {{like a big}} bonus really. Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'No one's really going to hear this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E
500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was horrible. It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{was taken by}} {{photographer}} Jill Greenberg. The image {{was part of a}} series of promotional images taken by Greenberg, inspired by her previous End Times exhibition. To create End Times, Greenberg gave lollipops to toddlers but took them back after several moments, provoking emotional outbursts. Greenberg used the images as a representation of American politics and society. Greenberg was accused of child abuse for the photo shoots; Stefani, however, commented, [...] "I didn't think 'child abuse'—I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'That's beautiful.' Every kid cries [...] Other people reacted like, 'Oh my God. That's so disturbing,' or 'That's so sad.' I guess that's what art's all about. It's supposed to make you think." ...|$|E

500|$|They {{continued}} to perform regularly around Crawley (including The Rocket, St. Edward's, and Queen's Square in particular) throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 {{they were joined}} at The Rocket {{for the first time}} by a support band from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead. [...] They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, [...] "We were very young. They <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to a {{game against}} the Cleveland Browns at Kezar Stadium in 1955, the 49ers staged [...] "Joe Perry Day", in which fans honored Perry with gifts {{including}} a new car. [...] "I was a favorite son," [...] he said of the occasion. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> Joe Perry Day {{was one of the great}} honors in my life." [...] He had 20 carries in that game for 116 yards, out-gaining the entire Browns backfield and prompting Cleveland coach Paul Brown to remark, [...] "This was Joe Perry's day in more ways than one." [...] Perry accounted for 701 rushing yards and two touchdowns in 1955, leading the 49ers in rushing for the seventh straight season. His streak was snapped by McElhenny in 1956.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be nice to}} have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Jackson {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record {{producer}} Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer. The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control (1986) was recorded. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life then that I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited".

500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time}} on September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
