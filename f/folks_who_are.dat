The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> fans any of these three singers, {{this is kind of a}} treat.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{at a rally}} {{which had}} been [...] {{disrupted}} by shouting Occupy Wall Street protestors, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum responded, [...] "People are allowed to protest and we respect their opinion. We just happen to believe that <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at public rallies should let both sides to be heard," [...] and later commented, [...] "Something that maybe these folks over here could ... maybe working a little bit instead of coming to these events and screaming at people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2016 {{interview}} with GQ magazine, Duckworth stated that gaining {{control of the}} Senate and [...] "closing the gap" [...] in the House would be {{necessary in order to}} pass common sense gun laws. She also stated that she believed moderate Republicans, who support common sense gun reform, would have more power to influence gun reform if they were not [...] "pushed aside by those <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> absolutely beholden to the NRA. And so we never get the vote." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...<b>Folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League {{has called}} Buchanan an [...] "unrepentant bigot" [...] who [...] "repeatedly demonizes Jews and {{minorities}} and openly affiliates with white supremacists." [...] "There's no doubt," [...] said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, [...] "he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice." [...] Buchanan denies {{that he is}} antisemitic, {{and a number of}} his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, [...] Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of the Reagan White House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world." [...] Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group Buchanan has also made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> from 2 percent of the population.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, {{and there}} was a little tremor in his voice, [...] "I don't think I shall forget you. Well, if ever you grow tired of the cities you will {{remember}} the lonely <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> longing to have you home again back there on the prairie." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was only}} a big dock: but you know the dragon-fly had never seen any but little water-trees; starwort, and milfoil, and water- crowfoot, and such like; so it did look very big to him. Besides, he was very short-sighted, as all dragon-flies are; and never could see a yard before his nose; {{any more than a}} great many other <b>folks,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not half as {{handsome}} as he.|$|E
60|$|Now Prickly Porky {{does not}} love Reddy Fox, {{and the more}} Reddy begged and scolded and called him names, the more Prickly Porky chuckled. It {{was such a good}} joke to think that he had trapped Reddy Fox, and he made up his mind that he would keep Reddy in there a long time just to tease him and make him uncomfortable. You see Prickly Porky remembered how often Reddy Fox played mean tricks on little meadow and forest <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> smaller and weaker than himself.|$|E

6000|$|She did {{not look}} like an adventurer when, at a Saturday noon of October, she left the office--slight, kindly, rather timid, with her pale hair and school-teacher eye-glasses, and clear cheeks set off by comely mourning. But she was seizing New York. She said over and over, [...] "Why, I can go and live any place I want to, and maybe I'll meet some <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> simply fascinating." [...] She wasn't very {{definite}} about these fascinating folks, but they implied girls to play with and--she hesitated--and decidedly men, men different from Walter, who would touch her hand in courtly reverence.|$|E
60|$|Let us, {{people who}} are so uncommonly clever and learned, have a great {{tenderness}} and pity for the poor <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not endowed with the prodigious talents which we have. I {{have always had a}} regard for dunces;--those of my own school-days were amongst the pleasantest of the fellows, and have turned out by no means the dullest in life; whereas many a youth who could turn off Latin hexameters by the yard, and construe Greek quite glibly, is no better than a feeble prig now, with not a pennyworth more brains than were in his head before his beard grew.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{dressed in}} broadcloth, silk, calico, home-spun, or feathers, friends are such {{valuable}} possessions {{that we must}} pay these <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> now announced {{as much attention as}} possible. And if we do this and in every way endeavor to make them feel comfortable and entirely at home, we will soon perceive a very great difference between them and many of our friends who dress in coats and frocks. For the more we do for our feathered friends, the more they will do for us. Now, you can't say that of all the men and women and boys and girls that you know. I wish most sincerely that you could.|$|E
60|$|Two days later, when Roger {{was packing}} up, {{getting ready to}} return home, he {{received}} a letter from Luke Watson that filled him with interest. Luke had gone to St. Augustine, Florida, to join his <b>folks,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> spending the winter there.|$|R
6000|$|Already {{they had}} been seen from the beach.

6000|$|... "For in {{no other}} can we take it," [...] said he, [...] "save, indeed, by miracle.

I just kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I can't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Carroll, {{with an air}} of reflection, [...] "there must be, I think, {{a certain}} {{distinctive}} stamp upon those who belong to the leader type; I mean the <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> capable of doing striking and heroic things. Apart from this, I've been studying you English--and it has struck me that there's occasionally something imperious, or rather imperial, in the faces of your women in the most northern counties. I can't define the thing, but it's there--in the line of nose, the mouth, and I think most marked in the brows. It's not Saxon, or Norse, or Danish. I'd sooner call it Roman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not exactly,' Ernest {{answered}} with a smile; 'but he has not entirely learned the way we here regard these penal measures. His sympathies are one-sided as to Alexander, no doubt. He thinks merely of the hunted, wretched life the man bears about with him, and he forgets poor bleeding, groaning, down-trodden, long-suffering Russia. It is the common way of Englishmen. They do not realise Siberia and Poland and the Third Section, {{and all the rest}} of it; they think only of Alexander as of the benevolent despot who freed the serf and befriended the Bulgarian. They never remember that they have all the freedom and privileges themselves which you poor Russians ask for in vain; they do not bear in mind that he has only to sign his name to a constitution, a very little constitution, and he might walk abroad as light-hearted in St. Petersburg to-morrow as you and I walk in Regent Street to-day. We are mostly lopsided, we English, but you must bear with us in our obliquity; we have had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due allowance for those unfortunate <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still in search of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] he answered. [...] "I didn't {{mean to be}} civil. I am one {{of those}} simple <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> always annoyed by the incomprehensible.

60|$|In the bay {{the fisher}} <b>folk,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> making ready for their day's work, pause {{a moment as}} they haul up their nets: with rough brown hands held above their eyes they look out upon that black speck--curious, interested, for the ship is not one they have seen in these waters before.|$|R
6000|$|A pity {{beyond all}} telling [...] Is {{hid in the}} heart of love: [...] The <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> buying and selling [...] The clouds on their journey above [...] The cold wet winds ever blowing [...] And the shadowy hazel grove [...] Where mouse-gray waters are flowing [...] Threaten the head that I love.|$|R
