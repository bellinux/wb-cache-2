5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 <b>feet)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of}} the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of}} the rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing a few <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis of the circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2008 found {{the foundations of}} a rectangular building, oriented north-north-west, {{thought to be the}} remains of a large hall, 33 x 13 metres (108 x 43 <b>feet).</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> north of the hall the survey found magnetic anomalies representing a complex of living buildings styled as a manor house. The same survey also found large magnetic anomalies {{in the eastern part of}} the site, which could be buried rubble from the demolition of a farmhouse, or the remains of in-filled cellars which are believed to have been built on the site. Evidence of a footpath around the interior of the site was also discovered. Given the evidence found, it is likely that the anomalies represent more than one phase of construction, though this could not be conclusively proven with the methods used.|$|E

5|$|Astaroth {{is shown}} to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned {{humanoid}} with solid white eyes. A black mask wraps around and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open gorget covers the nape of his neck and spiked spaulders cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knees respectively, and black garters wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a fauld and cloth loincloth.s character creation mode, in which they exist as components of Astaroth's secondary outfit Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart. During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming eyes were considered, but were cut from the finished product. Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 <b>feet,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

5|$|One block {{north of}} NY79, NY96 splits from NY13 and NY34 and {{heads to the}} west at Buffalo Street. NY89 begins here, and NY96 {{overlaps}} with NY89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY13 and NY34, NY89 and NY96 run parallel to and a few <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of NY79. NY89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY79. They do not intersect in this area—known locally as The Octopus—though they once did. At one time, NY96, NY79, NY89, NY13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY13A and NY79 intersect there while the stub of former NY89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.|$|E
5|$|Route22 then veers {{sharply to}} the northeast, {{resuming}} a northward direction {{only a short}} distance from the state line, a few hundred <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the New York State Thruway's Berkshire section (I-90) for a mile. NY980D (an unsigned reference route) leaves to the east, where it becomes Massachusetts Route102 at the state line. After Thruway exitB3, NY22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects NY295, then passes Queechy Lake. NY22 then straightens out to reach New Lebanon, where it intersects US20. New York's longest east–west route (US20) overlaps with its longest north–south route (NY22) for a mile before the former continues to Pittsfield and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into Rensselaer County.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{dimensions of}} Bowman Field were quite large {{compared to the}} dimensions of modern baseball fields. Bowman Field measured 367 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right field foul pole, 450 feet to dead center field and 400 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left field foul pole. Another unusual feature of the stadium was a terrace that was located on left field near the fence.|$|E
