5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, editions have moved {{increasingly}} {{to reflect the}} performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use {{in conjunction with a}} particular performance or recording.|$|E

25|$|Milton embraced many heterodox Christian {{theological}} views. He {{rejected the}} Trinity, {{in the belief}} that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{sociology}} expanded in the U.S., including developments in both macrosociology, {{concerned with the}} evolution of societies, and microsociology, concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic social psychology of George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), Herbert Blumer (1900–1987) and, later, the Chicago school, sociologists developed symbolic interactionism. In the 1920s, György Lukács released History and Class Consciousness (1923), while a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) developed action theory, integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics. In Austria and later the U.S., Alfred Schütz (1899–1959) developed social phenomenology, which would later inform social constructionism. During the same period members of the Frankfurt school, such as Theodor W. Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), developed critical theory, integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and Gramsci—in theory, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> in name—often characterizing capitalist modernity as a {{move away from the}} central tenets of enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Being descendents {{of divine}} unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an {{intermediate}} group between gods and men, {{and they are}} sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help {{on behalf of the}} island of Aegina, but also its national heroes Aeacus, Peleus and Telamon. Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of Phocus by his brothers Peleus and Telamon ("I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it ("silence is a man's wisest counsel"). The Theban hero Heracles was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the pankration at the Isthmian Games: a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.|$|E

500|$|On {{top of a}} poor {{commercial}} showing at the {{box office}} in 1960, critical reception to Crossroads to Crime has remained consistently negative. Anderson once called it [...] "possibly the worst film ever made", while Elliott considers it [...] "awful". Cohen and Levy were similarly unimpressed and offered Anderson no further commissions for Anglo-Amalgamated. During the promotional campaign for Thunderbirds Are Go, made by AP Films' successor company Century 21 and released in 1966, Sylvia Anderson said of the earlier film, [...] "The less said about it, the better"; she has since commented that it [...] "hardly ranks as one of our best efforts". A contemporary review in Monthly Film Bulletin was more positive: [...] "Quick off the mark, this modest little thriller soon settles down into a routine 'cops and robbers' format, efficient <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> too convincing." [...] Stronger praise came in the October 1960 issue of Kine Weekly, which commended Crossroads to Crime as being [...] "refreshingly free from pretence", adding: [...] "The film's moral is lofty, its tender domestic asides encourage feminine interest, and the climax is a corker." ...|$|E
