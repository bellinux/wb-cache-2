5|$|In 2012, over 40 {{per cent}} of Scotland's {{electricity}} came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40 per {{cent of the}} UK's renewables output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95 per cent (1,005 MW) {{on the end of}} 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output. The bulk of electricity production is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that electricity production {{is only part of the}} overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by <b>end</b> <b>users,</b> the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} advance {{our understanding of}} how visualisation can facilitate concept design. It focuses on how designers' use of a specific cognitive process, visualisation, can influence the development of design concepts. The paper presents a conceptual framework that links the type of visualisation (memory vs imagination) and the content of visualisation (incorporation of the <b>end</b> <b>user)</b> {{to the nature of the}} design process and to the nature of the design outcome, i. e. its originality, usefulness, and customer appeal. Two experiments are presented that test the propositions that flow from the proposed model. The results indicate that the designer's experience in the design process improves in terms of the difficulty experienced in designing the product and information value, as a function of whether the imaginative visualisation is used, and whether or not the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> is incorporated in the visualisation. Additionally, visualisation, by the designer, that involves both imagination and images of the <b>end</b> <b>user,</b> results in designs that are perceived to be more useful by the <b>end</b> <b>user.</b> This effect, however, is not realised when memory visualisation and images of the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> are combined. Finally, and most importantly, visualising the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> in combination with imagination-based visualisation led to designs that were significantly more appealing to the customer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
