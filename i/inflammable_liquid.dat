40|$|A {{standard}} problem in large tanks at oil refineries and petrol stations is that water and fuel usually occupy the same tank.

The plasmonic sensor is composed of a hemispherical glass prism, a magnesium fluoride layer, and a gold layer. We have optimized the structural parameters of the sensor from the theoretical modeling of the reflectance curve. The sensor detects water-fuel and fuel-air interfaces and measures the level of each liquid in real time. This sensor is recommended for <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> because inside the tank there are no electrical or electronic signals which could cause explosions.

Nevarne snovi so lahko zaradi svojih lastnosti škodljive ljudem, živalim in okolju, predstavljajo pa tudi zelo veliko tveganje za nastanek katastrofalnih nezgod. Zaradi tega morajo biti vsi udeleženci pri prevozu nevarnih snovi ustrezno usposobljeni za delo z nevarnimi snovmi.

40|$|In this study, Wind Force and Seismic forces {{acting on}} an Elevated water tank e. g. Intze Tank are studied. Seismic forces {{acting on the}} tank are also {{calculated}} changing the Seismic Response Reduction Factor(R). IS: 1893 - 1984 / 2002 for seismic design and IS: 875 - 1987 (Part III) for wind load has been referred. Then checked the Design of Intze Tank by using the software STAAD PRO. An Earthquake is a phenomenon that results from and is powered by the sudden release of stored energy in the crust that propagates Seismic waves. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes tsunamis, which may lead to loss of life and destruction of property. Seismic safety of liquid tanks is of considerable importance. Water storage tanks should remain functional in the post earthquake period to ensure potable water supply to earthquake-affected regions and to cater the need for fire fighting demand. Industrial liquid containing tanks may contain highly toxic and <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> and these tanks should not loose their contents during the earthquake. The current design of supporting structures of elevated water tanks are extremely vulnerable under lateral forces due to an earthquake as it is designed only for the wind forces but not the seismic forces. The strength analysis of a few damaged shaft types of stagings clearly shows {{that all of them}} either met or exceeded the strength requirement of IS: 1893 - 1984 however they were all found deficient when compared with requirements of International Building Codes. Frame type stagings are generally regarded superior to shaft type of stagings for lateral resistance because of their large redundancy and greater capacity to absorb seismic energy through inelastic actions. Various Codes have been considered and the maximum value of the ratio of base shear coefficient of tank to building, (BSCtank / BSCbldg) is about 3 to 4 in all the codes, as against a value of 6 to 7 for low ductility tanks. This implies that design base shear for a low ductility tank is double that of a high ductility tank. Indian Standard IS: 1893 - 1984 provides guidelines for earthquake resistant design of several types of structures including liquid storage tanks. This standard is under revision and in the revised form it has been divided into five parts. First part, IS 1893 (Part 1) : 2002; which deals with general guidelines and provisions for buildings has already been published. Second part, yet to be published, will deal with the provisions for liquid storage tanks. In this section, provisions of IS: 1893 - 1984 for buildings and tanks are reviewed briefly followed by an outline of the changes made in IS 1893 (Part 1) : 2002. Any design of water tanks is subjected to Dead Load + Live Load and Wind Load or Earthquake load as per I S Code of Practice. Most of the times tanks are designed for Wind Load and not even checked for Earthquake load assuming that the tanks will be safe under Earthquake Loads once designed for Wind Loads. However present observation on the earthquake at Bhuj has shown that this tanks must have been designed for Wind Loads but did not stand Earthquake Load. Keeping this in view two Intze Tanks are designed with different specifications are studied by taking into account the provisions of 1893 : 2002 and for Elevated Tank 1893 : 1984 as well as NICEE suggestions and the results are presented. We have concluded that there is no uniformity in type of tanks described in various documents. All documents suggest consideration of Convective and Impulsive Components in seismic analysis of tanks. Ratio of Base Shear of tank and building is 6 to 7 for low ductility tanks and 3 to 4 for high ductility tanks. Suitable provisions for lower bound limit on spectral values for tanks are necessary. Indian Code needs to include provisions on lower bound limit on spectral values of buildings and tanks and also Convective Mode of vibration in the seismic analysis of tanks. Based on the review of various International Codes, it is recommended that IS 1893 should have values of R in range of 1. 1 to 2. 25 for different types of tanks. R Value taken in IS 1893 : 1984 is nowhere in the range corresponding to that value in different international codes. Base Shear and Base Moment increases from Zone 3 to Zone 4 to Zone 5. With the increase in R value Base Shear and Base Moment decreases. Considering the design aspect, the seismic forces remain constant in a particular Zone provided the soil properties remain same whereas the Wind force is predominant in coastal region, but in interior region earthquake forces are more predominant. For R= 2. 25 and 1. 8, column size (450 mm) and reinforcements (8, 25 Φ bar) remain same but for R= 1. 5, column size increases to 500 mm and reinforcements change to 8, 20 Φ bar. Using STAAD PRO also we got the same values...|$|R

40|$|Biohazards are non-conventional {{threats that}} are very {{difficult}} to manage. This is due to difficulties in the identification of biological agents that are responsible for the onset of a disease, which can be bacteria, viruses, fungus or toxins. In Italy, the first response system to biohazards is provided by the National Fire Brigade (NFB) (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco - CNVVF). The aim of this work is to evaluate the procedures adopted by the NFB for the management of biohazards. This is done by comparing the statistics of NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 for potential biohazard events, and chemical and radioactive risks. A series of solutions is then proposed to improve the NFB’s national response system for biohazards. 1. INTRODUCTION Biohazards is a very complex subject which is not easily explored. In fact, while for chemical and radiological-nuclear hazards we can often refer to well-known data, it is not the same for risks in the biological context (Kaszeta, 2012). The reason for this lack of information is clear; biohazards have still not been completely understood. For example, the molecular mechanisms of cancer development have only recently been associated with viruses directly transmitted (Butel, 2000). Moreover, commercialised systems and instruments do not currently exist to identify several biological agents, and the ones that exist do not allow instant infield identification. Hence, it is often necessary to use complex laboratory instrumentation for certain and rapid determination. The use of laboratory techniques require extended periods of Defence S&T Tech.

In Italy, the first response system to biohazard events is provided by the National Fire Brigade (NFB) (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco - CNVVF). In the last decade, the NFB had to create a new division to operate in these “new risk scenarios” (we used the term “new” taking into account the classical background of infield operators). Following events involving biohazards, such as envelope and package contamination with anthrax spores (2001), and the potential spread of the avian influenza pandemic (2006)), circulars decrees were issued ad hoc by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) in order to provide operative directions for firefighters (MOI, 2001 a; MOI, 2006). Immediately afterwards, the NFB was equipped with modern facilities for the detection and management of biological agents (e. g. mobile laboratories, decontamination units, etc.). The aim of this work is to evaluate the procedures adopted by the NFB for the management of biohazard events. This is done by comparing the statistics of NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 for potential biohazard events, and chemical and radioactive risks. A series of solutions is then proposed to improve the NFB’s national response system for biohazard events. 2. THE NFB AND THE ITALIAN MANAGEMENT OF CBRN RISKS 2. 1 NFB’s Role in CBRN Events The NFB, a key element of the Italian civil protection system, is part of the Department of Fire, Rescue Service and Civil Defense, which operates under the MOI. It consists of approximately 35, 000 units. The NFB ensures urgent technical rescue, even in circumstances of unconventional risks. Its original primary objective is “to protect the safety of persons and things, by preventing and extinguishing fires and providing technical services in general, including those related to air defence” (MOI, 1941). The functions of the NFB was formally updated in MOI (2006), whereby the role of the NFB for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) events is also defined, particularly in terms of counteracting the risks arising from CBRN substances, including from possible non-conventional crimes aimed at damaging people or property, using adequate instruments and mobile units. Therefore, in order to respond effectively to CBRN events, the NFB requires suitable technical skills, resources and specialised equipments. 2. 2 NFB’s Response Levels NFB’s model response for CBRN events is described in the NFB intervention model (MOI, 2001 b). It is a mechanism of response that involves three different competency levels related to the complexity of the handling of the event. According to the intervention model, the local team (normally the closest one, the “basic team”) must reach the location of the event first. This team will then evaluate the situation, and determine the requirements for adequate means and support of other teams more qualified for that type of intervention. The intervention teams based on the level of qualification are as follows: Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 35 Evaluation of biohazard management of the Italian national fire brigade a) Basic team: Locally qualified to ensure the first intervention; b) Province specialists: Present in each provincial command; c) CBRN regional operative unit: Present in each command in the regional capital towns. Some of the regional commands are equipped with mobile analytical CBRN laboratories. It is specifically built for the CBRN unit of the NFB to carry out chemical, radioactive and biological sample analyses at the event site. Thus, they are able to obtain results in a shorter amount of time (Gulli et al., 2008). 2. 3 Scenarios and Type of Intervention In the case of biohazard events, the NFB refers to MOI (2001 b) to define the standard scenarios of intervention. Several possible scenarios of action are presented: a) Presence of suspicious material without clear traces of powder or liquid; b) Presence of suspicious material with clear traces of powder or liquid dispersed on surfaces but not spread within the environment; c) Presence of suspicious material with clear traces of powder dispersed on surfaces and also spread within the environment. Similarly, the types of events {{can be traced to the}} following three categories: a) Release (or risk of release) without (or no risk of) fire or explosion; b) Release (or risk of release) with (or risk of) fire or explosion; c) Recovery of hazardous substance (or suspect) without (or remote) risk of loss. 3. BIOHAZARDS Biohazards are linked to the exposure to biological agents and represent a potential danger for public health. Biohazards may arise from a variety of events involving biological agents, such as the natural diffusion; the accidental diffusion (e. g., spill from a biotechnology industry) or the intentional release into the environment (e. g., for terroristic attacks or war actions) (EC, 2012). Biological agents are microorganisms, including those which have been genetically modified, cell cultures and human endoparasites, which can cause any infection, allergy or toxicity (EC, 2000; MOL, 2008; DOL, 2012). According to EC (2000), biological agents can be classified into four risk groups depending on their level of risk of infection: Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 36 Orlando Cenciarelli et. al a) Group 1 : Agents that are unlikely to cause human disease. b) Group 2 : Agents that can cause human disease and might be a hazard to workers. They are unlikely to spread to the community, and there is usually effective prophylaxis or treatment available. c) Group 3 : Agents that can cause severe human disease and present a serious hazard to workers. They may present a risk of spreading to the community, but there is usually effective prophylaxis or treatment available. d) Group 4 : Agents that cause severe human disease and are a serious hazard to workers. They may present a high risk of spreading to the community, and there is usually no effective prophylaxis or treatment available. CDC (2012) further classifies the most important biological agents into three categories: a) Category A: Agents that can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person. They result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact. They might cause public panic and social disruption, and require special action for public health preparedness. b) Category B: Agents that are moderately easy to disseminate. They result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality, and require specific enhanced diagnostic capacity and disease surveillance. c) Category C: Emerging agents that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of their availability. They are easy to produce and disseminate. They are potentially linked to high morbidity and mortality rates, and major health impact. Biological agents can be further classified according to certain characteristics that define the hazard to health (NATO, 1996) : a) Infectivity: The aptitude of an agent to penetrate and multiply in the host; b) Pathogenicity: The ability of the agent to cause a disease after penetrating into the body; c) Transmissibility: The ability of the agent to be transmitted from an infected individual to a healthy one; d) Ability to neutralise: Means to have preventive tools and/or therapeutic purposes. Each biological agent can be transmitted through one or more ways. The transmission modes are mainly (La Placa, 2010) : a) Parenteral: Agents that are transmitted through body fluids or blood; b) Airway (by droplets) : Agents that are emitted by infected people, which can then be inhaled by surrounding people; c) Contact: Through which the agents present on the surface of the infected organism can infect another organism; Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 37 Evaluation of biohazard management of the Italian national fire brigade d) Oral-fecal route: Through objects, foods or other items contaminated with the feces of infected patients, or through sexual contact. 4. STATISTICS FOR NFB INTERVENTIONS FOR CHEMICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL RISKS, AND POTENTIAL BIOHAZARDS Since 2000, the NFB publishes on their website statistics of province command interventions for yearly periods (NFB, 2012). For this work, statistics regarding CBRN was collected for analysis. In particular, as shown in Table 1, the interventions involving chemical and radiological risks were examined. The total number of interventions involving chemical substances was obtained by adding all the events classified as “chemical substances involved” and “other <b>inflammable</b> and <b>liquid</b> and/or gaseous combustibles”, which includes “accident with a vehicle transporting dangerous substances”, “flipping over of a truck transporting dangerous substances” and “a gas leak”. The total number of interventions involving radioactive substances is reported in the official NFB statistics tout court and includes, among others, “recovery of radioactive lightning rod” and “recovery of radioactive substances”. Table 1 : NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 involving chemical and radioactive substances. (Adapted from NFB (2012)). The estimation of the percentages of interventions involving chemical and radioactive substances over total interventions is calculated for yearly periods. The mean percentage is obtained by averaging the annual percentages calculated over total yearly interventions. While chemical and radiological risks are clearly evaluated in the NFB’s statistics, this is not done for biohazards, which is neither considered nor put into a table. For this reason, in order to conduct a statistical analysis, we considered the types of interventions that can be potentially associated to biohazards (natural, human related or voluntary) as the following: a) Saving of people; b) Recovery of dead people; c) Saving of animals; d) Recovery of dead animals; e) Transport of patients.

Following this notional evaluation, surprising results are obtained, as shown in Table 2. By taking the mean of the 2000 - 2010 data, we have a high percentage value (6. 61...|$|R
