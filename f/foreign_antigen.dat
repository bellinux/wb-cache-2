5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
25|$|Once the plasmid inserts {{itself into}} the {{transfected}} cell nucleus, it codes for a peptide string of a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> On its surface cell the displays the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> with both histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and class II molecules. The antigen-presenting cell then travels to the lymph nodes and presents the antigen peptide and costimulatory molecule signaled by T-cell, initiating the immune response.|$|E
25|$|A lymph {{follicle}} is a dense {{collection of}} lymphocytes, the number, size and configuration of which change {{in accordance with}} the functional state of the lymph node. For example, the follicles expand significantly when encountering a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> The selection of B cells, or B lymphocytes, occurs in the germinal center of the lymph nodes.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{intriguing}} properties of T cell population {{is that the}} frequency of the precursors that respond to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-en-coded alloantigens are several orders of magnitude higher than the frequency of precursors responding to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> (1, 2). To explain this observation, it has been postulated that at least some T cells responding to the MHC alloantigens are also capable of responding to various <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b> Studies on the specificity of T cell clones provided direct support for this hypothesis. Indeed, several T cell clones recognizing <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> in association with self-MHC-encoded antigens and displaying alloreactivity have been reported (3 - 6). The observation that half of the clones having identical specificity for an insulin epitope recognized in association with syngeneic I-A b gene product also respond to alloantigens of H- 2 u haplotype, indicated that a certain degree of mimicry exists between alloantigens and <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> associated with syngeneic H- 2 gene products (7). Although these studies demonstrate that a single T cell clone specific for antigen in association with a syngeneic H- 2 gen...|$|R

40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the initiation of autoimmune responses by autoreactive T-cell clones. One of these, the molecular mimicry hypothesis, postulates that myelin-reactive T-cell clones are activated by <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b> Until recently, sequence homology between self- and <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> was considered necessary for cross-recognition to occur in multiple sclerosis. This article reviews current progress in T-cell receptor immunology that led to modify this view and proposes a role for degenerate T-cell antigen recognition in the induction of autoimmunity...|$|R
25|$|Although the {{verification}} {{stage is}} necessary for the activation of naïve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. As naïve CD8+ T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 {{plays an important role in}} decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} framework explaining {{the workings of}} the adaptive immune system is provided by immune network theory, based on interactions between idiotypes (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of antigenic determinants of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype {{as if it were a}} <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen).</b> This theory, which builds on the existing clonal selection hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by Niels Jerne and Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the HIV pathogenesis and the search for an HIV vaccine.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} evidence for mimicking events caused not only by amino acid similarities but also in similarities in binding motifs to the MHC. Molecular mimicry is thus occurring between two recognized peptides that have similar antigenic surfaces {{in the absence of}} primary sequence homology. For example, specific single amino acid residues such as cysteine (creates di-sulfide bonds), arginine or lysine (form multiple hydrogen bonds), could be essential for T cell cross-reactivity. These single residues may be the only residues conserved between self and <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> that allow the structurally similar but sequence non-specific peptides to bind to the MHC.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the binding to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> and {{the expression of}} crossreactive idiotypes {{by a panel of}} 20 murine monoclonal autoantibodies encoded by V genes from the VH J 558 family. 9 of 20 antibodies bound to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> such as bacterial polysaccharides, poly(Glu 50, Tyr 50), poly(Glu 54,Lys 37,Phe 9), arsonate, and lysozyme, known to interact with antibodies encoded by genes from the VH J 558 family. A high proportion of our panel of autoantibodies expressed crossreactive idiotypes originally borne by monoclonal rheumatoid factors, anti-Sm, and anti-DNA antibodies, all encoded by V genes from the VH J 558 family. Some of these VH J 558 + autoantibodies shared crossreactive idiotypes with VH J 558 + antibodies directed against <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> such as influenza virus hemagglutinin, poly(Glu 60,Ala 30,Tyr 10), arsonate, and dextran.

25|$|Having {{received}} the first TCR/CD3 signal, the naïve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure {{to ensure that}} a T cell is responding to a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} only a limited {{repertoire}} of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and negative selection mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as clonal anergy. The mechanism of clonal anergy is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a naïve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E
40|$|A problem {{associated}} with the use of vaccinia virus recombinants as vaccines is the existence of a large human population with preexisting immunity to the vector. Here we showed that after a booster with attenuated recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA), higher humoral and cellular immune responses to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env and β-galactosidase) were found in mice preimmunized with rMVA than in mice primed with the virulent Western Reserve strain and boosted with rMVA.

40|$|To {{understand}} how the immune system manages to disarm potentially harmful T cells with reactivity against self-antigens, many immunologists have turned to model systems in which transgenic expression of TCRs, <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens,</b> or both, allows visualization of otherwise undetectable mechanisms.

25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E
500|$|The {{study of}} {{antibodies}} began in 1890 when Kitasato Shibasaburō described antibody activity against diphtheria and tetanus toxins. Kitasato put forward {{the theory of}} humoral immunity, proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the side-chain theory for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as [...] "side-chains") {{on the surface of}} cells could bind specifically to toxins– in a [...] "lock-and-key" [...] interaction– and that this binding reaction is the trigger for the production of antibodies. Other researchers believed that antibodies existed freely in the blood and, in 1904, Almroth Wright suggested that soluble antibodies coated bacteria to label them for phagocytosis and killing; a process that he named opsoninization.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{and higher}} {{primates}} also produce [...] "natural antibodies" [...] that {{are present in}} serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> exposure or passive immunization. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. Rejection of xenotransplantated organs is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.|$|E
