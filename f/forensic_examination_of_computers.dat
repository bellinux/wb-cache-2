50|$|XRY is {{designed}} to recover {{the contents of a}} device in a forensic manner so that the contents of the data can be relied upon by the user. Typically it is used in civil/criminal investigations, intelligence operations, data compliance and electronic discovery cases. The software is available to law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies. It has become well known in the digital forensics community as one of their common tools for this type of work. There are many more complex challenges when examining mobile phones in comparison to the <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> normal <b>computers.</b> Many mobile phones have their own proprietary operating systems, which makes reverse engineering of such devices a very complex operation. The speed of the mobile device market also means that there are many more new devices being manufactured on a regular basis, so a mobile forensics tool must deal with all of these issues before being suitable for the task.|$|R

There were 60 agents and more assigned to Lee's case, working {{to prove that he}} was a spy. The FBI conducted a search of Lee's house on April 10, seizing any item related to computers or computing, as well as anything that had notations written in Chinese. The FBI and the Department of Energy then decided to conduct a full <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> Lee's office <b>computer.</b> The <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> Lee's <b>computer</b> determined that he had backed up his work files, which were restricted though not classified, onto tapes, and had also transferred these files from a system used for processing classified data onto another, also secure, system designated for unclassified data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Computer {{profiling}} is {{the automated}} <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b> system {{in order to}} provide a human investigator with a characterisation of the activities that have taken place on that system. As part of this process, the logical components <b>of</b> the <b>computer</b> system – components such as users, files and applications- are enumerated and the relationships between them discovered and reported. This information is enriched with traces of historical activity drawn from system logs and from evidence of events found in the computer file system. A potential problem with the use of such information is that some of it may be inconsistent and contradictory thus compromising its value. This work examines the impact of temporal inconsistency in such information and discusses two types of temporal inconsistency that may arise – inconsistency arising out of the normal errant behaviour <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b> system, and inconsistency arising out of deliberate tampering by a suspect – and techniques for dealing with inconsistencies of the latter kind. We examine the impact of deliberate tampering through experiments conducted with prototype computer profiling software. Based on the results of these experiments, we discuss techniques which can be employed in computer profiling to deal with such temporal inconsistencies...|$|R
5000|$|Cyberterrorism {{was dealt}} with in various ways. Penalties apply to those who either damage or gain {{unauthorized}} access to a protected computer and then commit a number of offenses. These offenses include causing a person to lose an aggregate amount greater than US$5,000, as well as adversely affecting someone's medical examination, diagnosis or treatment. It also encompasses actions that cause a person to be injured, a threat to public health or safety, or damage to a governmental computer that {{is used as a}} tool to administer justice, national defense or national security. Also prohibited was extortion undertaken via a protected computer. The penalty for attempting to damage protected computers through the use of viruses or other software mechanism was set to imprisonment for up to 10 years, while the penalty for unauthorized access and subsequent damage to a protected computer was increased to more than five years imprisonment. However, should the offense occur a second time, the penalty increases up to 20 years imprisonment.The act also specified the development and support of cybersecurity forensic capabilities. It directs the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories that have the capability <b>of</b> performing <b>forensic</b> <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> intercepted <b>computer</b> evidence relating to criminal activity and cyberterrorism, and that have the capability of training and educating Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors in computer crime, and to [...] "facilitate and promote the sharing of Federal law enforcement expertise and information about the investigation, analysis, and prosecution of computer-related crime with State and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, including the use of multijurisdictional task forces."

40|$|Computer {{forensics}} is {{the process}} of gathering and analysing evidence from computer systems to aid in the investigation of a crime. Typically, such investigations are undertaken by human forensic examiners using purpose-built software to discover evidence from a computer disk. This process is a manual one, and the time it takes for a forensic examiner to conduct such an investigation is proportional to the storage capacity <b>of</b> the <b>computer's</b> disk drives. The heterogeneity and complexity of various data formats stored on modern computer systems compounds the problems posed by the sheer volume of data. The decision to undertake a <b>computer</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b> system is a decision to commit significant quantities of a human examiner's time. Where there is no prior knowledge of the information contained on a computer system, this commitment of time and energy occurs with little idea of the potential benefit to the investigation. The key contribution of this research is the design and development of an automated process to describe a computer system and its activity for the purposes <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b> forensic investigation. The term proposed for this process is computer profiling. A model <b>of</b> a <b>computer</b> system and its activity has been developed over the course of this research. Using this model a computer system, which is the subj ect of investigation, can be automatically described in terms useful to a forensic investigator. The computer profiling process IS resilient to attempts to disguise malicious computer activity. This resilience is achieved by detecting inconsistencies in the information used to infer the apparent activity <b>of</b> the <b>computer.</b> The practicality <b>of</b> the <b>computer</b> profiling process has been demonstrated by a proof-of concept software implementation. The model and the prototype implementation utilising the model were tested with data from real computer systems. The resilience of the process to attempts to disguise malicious activity has also been demonstrated with practical experiments conducted with the same prototype software implementation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The review {{analyzes}} {{the possibility of}} multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use in the <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> corpses of adults. We present the critical analysis of literature on post-mortem imaging in terms of forensic thanatology. The review is based on basic Internet resources: Scientific Electronic Library (elibrary), Scopus, PubMed. The review includes articles that discuss both advantages and limitations of post-mortem MSCT and MRI imaging in <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the corpse. Through studying the available literature, the authors attempted to answer two questions: 1) which method was more suitable for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the corpse - MSCT or MRI; 2) whether the virtual autopsy replaced the traditional autopsy in the near future? Conclusion: comprehensive study of the corpse often requires both imaging methods; in cases of death under mechanical damage, MSCT exceeds the range of possibilities of MRI; today, virtual autopsy cannot completely replace traditional autopsy in forensic science, {{since there are no}} convincing evidence-based comparative studies, as well as the legal framework of the method.  </p...|$|R
