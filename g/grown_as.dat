5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able to tolerate dry conditions, are <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> houseplants.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

5|$|Cotton is {{integral}} to Pakistan's economy. According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land. It is grown during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the kharif period. It is also grown {{on a smaller scale}} between February and April.|$|E
5|$|Generally <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> a hardy annual, lettuce {{is easily}} cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|It is also <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> an {{ornamental}} tree in Northern Hemisphere countries with mild maritime climates, including {{parts of the}} upper West Coast of the United States and the warmer parts of the British Isles, where its common names include Torbay palm and Torquay palm. It does not do well in hot tropical climates like Queensland, Southeast Asia and Florida.|$|E

5|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{coupled with}} structural and political {{changes to the}} mining industry began the decline in Astley's industrial activities during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal {{was brought to the}} surface in 1970. However, Astley has <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> part of a commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city transport links. Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley's industrial heritage.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E

5|$|Plants <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described B.oblongifolia in 1800, {{though it}} was known as Banksia asplenifolia in New South Wales for many years. However, the latter name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. Two varieties were recognised in 1987, but these have not been generally accepted. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences. Though easily <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> a garden plant, it is not commonly seen in horticulture.|$|E
5|$|Sycamores {{make new}} growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can {{therefore}} be coppiced to produce poles {{and other types of}} small timber.

5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are <b>grown,</b> <b>as</b> well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely <b>grown</b> <b>as</b> an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
