5|$|As noted, the {{radioactive}} nature of technetium (3MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection <b>impractical</b> {{in almost all}} situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.|$|E
5|$|Morgan Lily {{as young}} Raven Darkhölme: with the actress wearing a slip-on {{bodysuit}} and facial appliances which only took one {{hour and a}} half to apply, as subjecting a child actor to the extensive make-up was <b>impractical.</b>|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, Royal Navy commanders {{considered}} that camouflage was largely unnecessary, {{given that the}} enemy would be using RDF and submarine hydrophones. In April 1943, the Admiralty decided that diffused lighting was <b>impractical,</b> and development was halted, though discussions continued with the Canadian Navy.|$|E
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved <b>impractical.</b> Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{stated that}} Alexander had given {{detailed}} written instructions to Craterus {{some time before}} his death. Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were <b>impractical</b> and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be <b>impractical.</b> Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. This was very <b>impractical</b> for many passengers, who were forced to use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E
5|$|In Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Army in April 1942, Herring {{was given}} command of Northern Territory Force. At this time Darwin was {{being subjected to}} Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was <b>impractical,</b> Herring developed a land line of communications running across the outback from Alice Springs.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The g-force {{effect on the}} human body also seemed to suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was <b>impractical</b> anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the Air Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|T2E1 Mine Exploder – This mine {{exploding}} equipment, {{which was}} meant to be used with the boom on the M32, was essentially the T2 mine exploder, but scaled up for use by the U.S. Marines. It was <b>impractical,</b> and the project was abandoned in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Company briefly {{considered}} {{sending a}} revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, {{saying that the}} unit would be <b>impractical</b> for trench warfare because of its small size. The battalion was thereupon dissolved, but most of its remaining men went to war in Europe anyway, generally with South African units.|$|E
5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore <b>impractical,</b> and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor.|$|E
5|$|The udema was of an {{innovative}} new design {{with a single}} line of guns along the ship's centerline, a foreshadowing of the dreadnought battleships of the early 20th century. The design proved <b>impractical</b> for its time, however, and only three udemas were built between 1760 and 1776.|$|E
5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly <b>impractical</b> as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{a bronze}} {{memorial}} plaque, inscribed {{with the name}} of the deceased alongside Britannia and a lion, and a scroll, sent to the next of kin of those had died {{in the service of the}} British Empire. Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately after the end of the war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was <b>impractical</b> to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming <b>impractical,</b> {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} <b>impractical</b> for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan <b>impractical</b> except for deterrence, due to security concerns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged <b>impractical</b> as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved <b>impractical</b> due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (<b>impractical)</b> ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved <b>impractical</b> due to the headroom limitations {{on the line and}} the closure was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become <b>impractical.</b> After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it <b>impractical.</b>|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be <b>impractical,</b> and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly <b>impractical</b> to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this <b>impractical</b> solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be <b>impractical</b> for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught <b>impractical</b> skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to {{for a few moments}} during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body <b>impractical</b> and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, <b>impractical</b> artist.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that <b>impractical.</b> This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy operating out of Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T. Layton to the Aleutians to investigate the allegations. The result {{of this investigation was}} the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, as well as the town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians would be for the most part <b>impractical</b> due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it <b>impractical.</b> Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed quickly and easily. With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be <b>impractical,</b> at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations {{are limited to}} two retail distribution licenses, making it <b>impractical</b> for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer {{as they do in}} many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws.|$|E
