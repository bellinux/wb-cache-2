50|$|Pressure drop {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network. Pressure drop occurs when frictional forces, caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through the tube. The main determinants of resistance to fluid flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and fluid viscosity. Pressure drop increases proportional to the frictional shear forces within the piping network. A piping network containing a high relative roughness rating as well as many pipe fittings and joints, tube convergence, divergence, turns, surface roughness and other physical properties will affect the pressure drop. <b>High</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> and / or high fluid viscosities result in a larger pressure drop across a section of pipe or a valve or elbow.

50|$|Vacuum {{technology}} {{is based on}} differential air pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the vacuum station, {{which is also the}} only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity. Interface valves, that are installed inside the collection chambers, work pneumatically. Sewage flows by means of gravity from each house into a collection sump that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in public area. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is usually transferred by a pneumatically (pneumatic pressure created by fill level) controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself. While the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater towards the vacuum station. Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. <b>High</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.|$|E

40|$|The {{deoxygenation}} {{rates of}} transformed erythrocytes {{were compared with}} those of normal discocytes by both stopped-flow and continuous-flow methods. Echinocytic and spherostomatocytic transformations were induced by various anionic and cationic drugs, respectively, without altering the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin, the cell volume or the membrane fluidity. The echinocytic transformation reduced the deoxygenation rate at slow-flow velocities (50 cm/sec), as detected by the continuous-flow method. However, at <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> (150 cm/sec) the rate was similar to that seen in normal discocytes. A close correlation between the degree of echinocytosis, the retardation of deoxygenation rate and the increase of suspension viscosity were observed. Microscopic observation of flowing erythrocytes revealed that the echinocytes scarcely deformed at the slower <b>flow</b> <b>velocity,</b> but clearly deformed at the <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocity</b> to various shapes resembling the flowing discocytes. Transformation to spherostomatocytes had no effect on the deoxygenation rate, which was comparable with that of the discocytes, and even the <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> force did not induce any deformation. The retarded deoxygenation and the increased viscosity of echinocytes was probably due to an augmented stagnant layer around the cells (i. e. an increase of the hydrodynamic effective volume); this layer was reduced when the echinocytes were deformed with increasing flow force...|$|R

40|$|Convential {{models for}} the erosion of {{non-cohesive}} sediments overestimate the erosion rate induced by <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocities.</b> These <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> <b>velocities</b> occur, for instance, in breaching of embankments or dunes (flow velocities up to 10 m/s) or in jetting sand with a {{trailing suction hopper dredger}} (30 to 60 m/s). At these very large flow velocities the erosion process is significantly influenced by the properties of the soil mass (non-cohesive particles). Governing parameters at higher flow velocities are dilatancy, permeability and the (un) drained shear strength of the soil. The sediment concentration in the water also influences the erosion process, especially in case of higher erosion rates. Based on the concept of Van Rhee (2007, 2010) a simple analytical formula is derived that gives a clear insight into the parameters influencing hindered erosion. The concept of hindered erosion is explained by two properties of granular soils: dilatancy and permeability. This implicates that the erosion behaviour of granular soils cannot be described by the behaviour of single particles alone. The properties of the whole soil mass should be considered in predicting erosion at higher flow velocities. Results of a large-scale breach experiment performed in 1994 in the Zwin Channel in the Netherlands (Visser, 1998) are analyzed to evaluate the formula.
