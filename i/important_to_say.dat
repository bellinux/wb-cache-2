Taking him to the local club, Peter {{introduces}} Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde.

2500|$|As a Neo-concrete artist, Lygia Pape's Livro da Criacao [...] synthesizes {{reason and}} emotion. The {{participant}} {{is meant to}} have a phenomenological experience by handling the book. Each reading of the work might be different based on the individual's experiences. As Lygia Pape noted, [...] "It's <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that there are two}} plausible readings: for me it is the book of the creation of the world, but for others it can be the book of [...] "creation." [...] Through each person's experiences, there is a process of open structure through which each structure can generate its own reading." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} his Bachelor of Fine Arts {{degree in}} 1971, {{he moved to}} Rochester, New York, to attend graduate school at Rochester Institute of Technology, concentrating again in painting and printmaking. [...] During {{the course of his}} two-year graduate program, he married Judith Dionne, a fellow art student from Southeastern Massachusetts University, and their son, Trevor, was born. [...] Even as he pursued a degree in painting, his interest in the medium began to wane. [...] Before the end of his master’s program, he had {{come to the conclusion that}} he had “nothing <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in painting” and that the importance of painting in the art world was on the decline. [...] Within months after receiving his Master of Fine Arts degree in 1973, he had stopped painting altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Keller also {{discusses}} {{a primary}} {{critic of the}} long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that one type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual [...] "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms. [...] This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all. [...] Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced {{by the presence of}} women and other writers.|$|E

On the future of the band, Dan Searle wrote, [...] "We want to carry on, that is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and we will strive to do so, but we will not release any music unless we truly believe that it is something that Tom would have been proud of. Whether or not we can achieve that is something that we will have to discover in time". Sean Delander of Thy Art Is Murder filled in for Searle on the Australian tour, and Josh Middleton of Sylosis filled in on the European tour.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine, {{who gave}} the season a [...] "B", felt Harlem was [...] "a wonderfully {{utilized}} character, both a welcome departure from the well-explored Hell’s Kitchen and a distinct neighborhood unto itself," [...] along with strong performances from Colter (bringing [...] "a needed intensity") and Ali ("compelling and threatening as Cottonmouth"), though felt some of its [...] "talkier moments" [...] and its pacing {{were some of the}} season's weak spots. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen awarded the season a [...] "B-" [...] saying [...] "Luke Cage is a meaningful attempt at developing a new-model black hero. As entertaining drama, it’s trapped in a not-so-Marvelous trapped cage", though he criticized it as [...] "one more piece of Marvel pop that expresses its ballyhooed shared-world premise so poorly, it’s jarring when it even happens," [...] {{as well as some of}} the season's logic, [...] "sluggish pace [...] thinly stretched plot". Reviewing the entire season, Terri Schwartz of IGN awarded it an 8.4 out of 10, saying, [...] "Marvel's Luke Cage doesn't reach the heights of Daredevil and Jessica Jones, and its flawed second half ends up diminishing what was otherwise a fantastic season. But with something <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and interesting new characters, Luke Cage is another win for Marvel's Netflix shows." ...|$|E
