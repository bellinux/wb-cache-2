40|$|AbstractThe {{rendezvous}} and formation {{problem is}} a significant part for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technique. It {{can be divided into}} two major phases: the long-range guidance phase and the formation phase. In this paper, an <b>iterative</b> computation <b>guidance</b> law (ICGL) is proposed to compute a series of state variables to get the solution of a control variable for a UAV conducting rendezvous with a tanker in AAR. The proposed method can make the control variable converge to zero when the tanker and the UAV receiver come to a formation flight eventually. For the long-range guidance phase, the ICGL divides it into two sub-phases: the correction sub-phase and the guidance sub-phase. The two sub-phases share the same iterative process. As for the formation phase, a velocity coordinate system is created by which control accelerations are designed to make the speed of the UAV consistent with that of the tanker. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ICGL is effective and robust against wind disturbance...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explains}} the rationale and {{approach of the}} PERC methodology and presents consolidated findings from studies conducted so far. Conducting a forensic post-event study is similar to detective work in that it needs an experienced team of experts, a consistent and <b>iterative</b> meta-structure, and <b>guidance</b> on how to pursue leads and new information. As part of this analysis and assessment work, an agent landscape map is built identifying the key players involved in disaster risk management and their roles, decision making, and communication structures and interactions within their and across sectors. The central aim of a single PERC analysis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive picture of what happened and why, and what opportunities exist to build disaster resilience. By using a systematic methodology like PERC to provide a “forensic” analysis of disaster events, we are identifying generalizable lessons aimed at understanding and increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability across social, political, economic, and geographic contexts...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{objectives}} of sustainability, economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance, physical protection and stakeholder relations {{must be considered}} during the design of an advanced reactor. However, an advanced reactor's core damage frequency dominates all other considerations at the preliminary stage of reactor design. An iterative four-step methodology to guide the MIT gas-cooled fast reactor emergency core cooling system design through PRA insights was utilized based upon the preliminary stage of the reactor design and activities currently ongoing in the nuclear industry, regulator, and universities regarding advanced reactors. Advanced reactor designs also face an uncertain regulatory environment. It was concluded from the move towards risk- informed regulations of current reactors, {{that there will be}} some level of probabilistic insights in the regulations and supporting regulatory documents for advanced, "Generation-IV" nuclear reactors. The four-step methodology is moreover used to help designers analyze designs under potential risk-informed regulations and predict design justifications the regulator will require during the licensing process. The <b>iterative</b> design <b>guidance</b> methodology led to a reduction of the CDF contribution due to a LOCA of over three orders of magnitude from the baseline ECCS design (from 1. 19 x 10 - 5 to 6. 48 x 10 - 8 for the 3 x 100 % loop configuration) and potential ECCS licensing issues were identified. This illustrates the value of formal design guidance based upon PRA. by Michael J. Delaney. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2004.

40|$|Mission {{requirements}} in various NASA programs dictate {{the necessity for}} high reliability, continual and chronic increases in payload capability, and precise injection into the prescribed orbit. In some vehicles, concepts employed to meet these criteria {{in the areas of}} guidance and propulsion {{have been found to be}} somewhat in conflict. For the express purpose of increasing reliability, the primary emphasis in engine and feed design has been placed on simplification including the removal of control systems. In the guidance area considerable attention has been given to the development of methods of implementation which allow complete reshaping of the pitch program if the stage should perform at some level other than predicted. In such a guidance scheme the assumption is made that observed differences in performance levels are constant throughout flight. In the absence of propulsion control systems, however, some oscillations about a mean value representative of the shift can be expected. Analyses showed that this occurrence would severely limit the effectiveness of the <b>Iterative</b> <b>Guidance</b> Mode. The purpose of this paper is to deal with the definition, causes and cures of this problem...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{implementing}} Saturn V lunar missions from an {{earth parking orbit}} is presented. The ground launch window is assumed continuous over a four and one-half hour period. The <b>iterative</b> <b>guidance</b> scheme combined {{with a set of}} auxiliary equations that define suitable S-IVB cutoff conditions, is the approach taken. The four inputs to the equations that define cutoff conditions are represented as simple third-degree polynomials as a function of ignition time. Errors at lunar arrival caused by the separate and combined effects of the guidance equations, cutoff conditions, hypersurface errors, and input representations are shown. Vehicle performance variations and parking orbit injection errors are included as perturbations. Appendix I explains how aim vectors were computed for the cutoff equations. Appendix II presents all guidance equations and related implementation procedures. Appendix III gives the derivation of the auxiliary cutoff equations. No error at lunar arrival was large enough to require a midcourse correction greater than one meter per second assuming a transfer time of three days and the midcourse correction occurs five hours after injection. Since this result is insignificant when compared to expected hardware errors, the implementation procedures presented are adequate to define cutoff conditions for Saturn V lunar missions...|$|E
40|$|A {{real-time}} guidance {{scheme for}} the problem of maximizing the payload into orbit subject to the equations of motion for a rocket over a spherical, non-rotating earth is presented. An approximate optimal launch guidance law is developed based upon an asymptotic expansion of the Hamilton - Jacobi - Bellman or dynamic programming equation. The expansion is performed {{in terms of a}} small parameter, which is used to separate the dynamics of the problem into primary and perturbation dynamics. For the zeroth-order problem the small parameter is set to zero and a closed-form solution to the zeroth-order expansion term of Hamilton - Jacobi - Bellman equation is obtained. Higher-order terms of the expansion include the effects of the neglected perturbation dynamics. These higher-order terms are determined from the solution of first-order linear partial differential equations requiring only the evaluation of quadratures. This technique is preferred as a real-time, on-line guidance scheme to alternative numerical iterative optimization schemes because of the unreliable convergence properties of these <b>iterative</b> <b>guidance</b> schemes and because the quadratures needed for the approximate optimal guidance law can be performed rapidly and by parallel processing. Even if the approximate solution is not nearly optimal, when using this technique the zeroth-order solution always provides a path which satisfies the terminal constraints. Results for two-degree-of-freedom simulations are presented for the simplified problem of flight in the equatorial plane and compared to the guidance scheme generated by the shooting method which is an iterative second-order technique...|$|E
40|$|Embedding {{knowledge}} graphs (KGs) into continuous vector spaces is a {{focus of}} current research. Combining such an embedding model with logic rules has recently attracted increasing attention. Most previous attempts made a one-time injection of logic rules, ignoring the interactive nature between embedding learning and logical inference. And they focused only on hard rules, which always hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort to create or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), a novel paradigm of KG embedding with <b>iterative</b> <b>guidance</b> from soft rules. RUGE enables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples that have been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labels {{are going to be}} predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with various confidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process, RUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, and integrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Through this iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be better transferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction on Freebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledge injected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties, automatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, even those with moderate confidence levels.
