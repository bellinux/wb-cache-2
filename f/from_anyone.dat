Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering it to stop performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come <b>from</b> <b>anyone</b> in the administration.|$|E

40|$|Emergency Blood Service using Android is an {{application}} {{that can be}} installed in any Android mobile phones {{and can be used}} at the time of emergency when someone is in need for blood. The project proposed will reveal the identity of the users only at the time of donation of blood. The authentication is not provided for the application usage and hence the application can be accessed <b>from</b> <b>anyone’s</b> mobile at the time of emergency. The identity of all the users of the application are hidden. Anyone can easily access the application <b>from</b> <b>anyone’s</b> mobile. Hence even a stranger can become a helping hand at the time of emergency. The location of the users can’t be updated all the time. Hence the location of the requestor is also found at the time of emergency. The users willing to donate blood can acknowledge the request. Misusing the numbers of any user of the application is totally avoided since even the user who is requesting for blood cannot view others details. The details of the donor will be provided to the requestor only at the time of emergency. Updating the location is also not needed since the application tracks the location...|$|R

25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada.

Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he feels is right. In this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination <b>from</b> <b>anyone.</b> The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{attended}} Stanton Grammar School, {{graduating in}} the summer of 1912. Her family, however, could not afford to send her to high school, nor could they pay for any music lessons. Still, Anderson continued to perform wherever she could and learn <b>from</b> <b>anyone</b> who was willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the Camp Fire Girls which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually the directors of the People's Chorus and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend South Philadelphia High School, from which she graduated in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Whenever possible, Mongol commanders {{found the}} highest ground available, {{from which they}} could make {{tactical}} decisions based on the best view of the battlefield as events unfolded.

Unlike the European armies, which placed enormous emphasis on personal valor, and thus exposed their leaders to death <b>from</b> <b>anyone</b> bold enough to kill them, the Mongols regarded their leaders as a vital asset. A general such as Subutai, unable to ride a horse in the later part of his career due to age and obesity, would have been ridiculed out of most any European army of the time.
