50|$|The strongest {{argument}} for us probably {{being in a}} simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong - two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and <b>it's</b> <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> is an Internet-based 501(c)3 nonprofit {{founded in}} the United States by gay activist, author, media pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller on September 21, 2010, {{in response to the}} suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or because their peers suspected that they were gay. Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' lives will improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the <b>It</b> <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities; the videos have received over 50 million views.|$|E

The project encourages adults, both LGBT and otherwise, to submit videos assuring gay teenagers that life can improve after bullying in early life.
