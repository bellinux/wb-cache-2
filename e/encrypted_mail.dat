40|$|Abstract—The {{certificate}} authority model for authenticating public keys of websites has been attacked in recent years, and several proposals {{have been made}} to reinforce it. We develop and extend certificate transparency, a proposal in this direction, so that it efficiently handles certificate revocation. We show how this extension can be used to build a secure end-to-end email or messaging system using PKI with no requirement to trust certificate authorities, or to rely on complex peer-to-peer key-signing arrangements such as PGP. This makes end-to-end <b>encrypted</b> <b>mail</b> possible, with apparently few additional usability issues compared to unencrypted mail (specifically, users do not need to understand or concern themselves with keys or certificates). Underlying these ideas is a new attacker model appropriate for cloud computing, which we call “malicious-but-cautious”. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the authors propose a protocol, which uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) {{based on the}} ElGamal’s algorithm, for sending small amounts of data via an {{authentication}} server. The innovation {{of this approach is}} that there is no need for a symmetric algorithm or a safe communication channel such as SSL. The reason that ECC has been chosen instead of RSA is that it provides a methodology for obtaining high-speed implementations of authentication protocols and <b>encrypted</b> <b>mail</b> techniques while using fewer bits for the keys. This means that ECC systems require smaller chip size and less power consumption. The proposed protocol has been implemented in Java to analyse its features and vulnerabilities in the real world. Keywords—Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), ElGamal, and authentication protocol. I. ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC...|$|E
40|$|PGP-KeyID: C 783 C 736, PGP <b>encrypted</b> <b>mail</b> welcome Abstract. Several {{automated}} techniques {{exist to}} transform ciphertext into text that “looks like ” natural-language text while retaining {{the ability to}} recover the original ciphertext. This transformation changes the ciphertext so that it doesn’t attract undue attention from, for example, attackers or agencies or organizations that might want to detect or censor encrypted communication. Although it {{is relatively easy to}} generate a small sample of quality text, it is challenging to be able to generate large texts that are “meaningful ” to a human reader and which appear innocuous. This paper expands on a previous approach that used sentence models and large dictionaries of words classified by part-of-speech [7]. By using an “extensible contextual template ” approach combined with a synonymbased replacement strategy, much more realistic text is generated than was possible with NICET EXT. ...|$|E

50|$|With no encryption, {{much like}} for postcards, email {{activity}} is plainly visible by any occasional eavesdropper. Email encryption enables privacy to be safeguarded by <b>encrypting</b> the <b>mail</b> sessions, {{the body of}} the message, or both. Without it, anyone with network access and the right tools can monitor email and obtain login passwords. Examples of concern include the government censorship and surveillance and fellow wireless network users such as at an Internet cafe.|$|R
40|$|Electronic mail is a {{communication}} model that is fundamental {{in the era}} of globalization. Proven on any form of registration data or information requires the presence of email address(electronic mail). The use of email itself cannot be separated from the abuse (such as stelling password and mail spoofing) from some parties so it needs security form in email communication. Communication security on mail server such as ZIMBRA mail server has been well-implemented, {{such as the use of}} ssl certificate.   But the security is still standard.   So, when user and password have been found out by third party, email content will be read easily (in cryptography technique it is called plaintext reading). On research that was conducted with pretty good privacy (PGP) method email communication security was focused on the email content by <b>encrypting</b> <b>mail</b> text along with the attachment file. In a study conducted, using the mail engine Zimbra mail server. Result of research shows that PGP security is able to secure email content whether the text or the attachment, showing difference of attachment file size is bigger on PGP using and change mail header from the standard mail...|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} are standardising on Lotus Notes/Domino as a groupware solution. With this move towards a standard groupware product and strategy, the risks from targeted attacks are increased. Exactly how virus resistant is Lotus Notes and what unique threats {{do you need}} to be aware of, and more importantly, how do you counter them? This paper aims to answer the above questions and the following questions, and offer advice {{that can be used in}} organisations that have or are planning to standardise on Lotus Notes/Domino. Œ Has Lotus Notes reached the critical mass for virus writers to target it as they have the Microsoft Office components (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access) ? Œ How will the virus writers approach this new vector for infection? Œ What are the threats from existing viruses, and how can these threats be minimised or eradicated in Lotus Notes? Œ What Notes specific threats (LotusScript, Buttons, Stored Forms, etc…) do I need to be aware of and what can be done to help minimise the potential threats? Œ What in-built security can be leveraged to help minimise the risks from virus attack? Œ How can <b>encrypted</b> <b>mail</b> be effectively used without risking viruses sneaking in through the outer-perimeter defences? This paper was written for, and presented at the 1999 Virus Bulletin conference at Vancouver, Canada on September 30 th- October 1 st 1999.

40|$|Cancer {{registration}} {{has developed}} in Europe {{over the last}} 50 years, {{and in the last}} decade intensive joint activities between the European Cancer Registries, in response to the need of pan-European harmonization of registration practices, have taken place. The Hungarian Paediatric Cancer Registry has been functioning as the database of the Hungarian Paediatric Oncology Network since 1971, aiming to follow the incidence and the treatment efficacy of malignant diseases. The goals of this globally unique open source information system are the following: 1) to raise the quality of the registration system to the European level by developing an Internet-based registration and communication system, modernizing the database, establishing automatic statistical analyses and adding an Internet website, 2) to support clinical epidemiological studies that we conduct with international collaborators on detailed analyses of the characteristics of patients and their diseases, evaluation of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods, prevention programs, and long-term quality of life and side effects. The benefits of the development of the Internet-based registration and communication system are as follows: a) introduction of an Internet-based case reporting system, b) modernization of the registry database according to international recommendations, c) automatic statistical summaries, <b>encrypted</b> <b>mail</b> systems, document repository, d) application of data security and privacy standards, e) establishment of a website and compilation of educational materials. The overall objective of this scientific project is to contribute towards the improvement of cancer prevention and cancer care {{for the benefit of the}} public in general and of cancer patients in particular...|$|E

40|$|Since it’s {{release in}} 1991 [11], PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) has {{seemingly}} held {{the promise of}} widespread email security. Despite this, the actual rate of adoption of PGP has been slow. We contend {{that there are two}} prime factors contributing to this poor adoption- that of perceived complexity, and inter-operable end-to-end integration. This paper proposes a system to facilitate wide-spread deployment of OpenPGP compliant email encryption across platforms and mail user agents. The system consists of an SMTP proxy; capable of seamlessly <b>encrypting</b> outgoing <b>mail</b> on a “best-effort ” basis, and a corresponding POP 3 proxy; capable of performing decryption and assisting in key management. ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{electronic}} mail is sent unencrypted, making it vulnerable to passive eavesdropping. We propose to protect email privacy by building encryption functionality into ESMTP mailers. Our solution, ssmail, provides fast, simple encryption for sendmail {{that does not}} require user intervention or reliance on public key infrastructure. We added {{a small number of}} steps to an ESMTP session, thereby allowing a client and server to create a secret, one-time session key used to <b>encrypt</b> the <b>mail</b> transfer session. ssmail relies on caching to reduce key generation overhead. The overhead imposed by our encryption scheme is minimal, allowing even busy mail servers to support privacy. We placed our encryption mechanism within the mail transfer agent itself, allowing people to use privacy protection software without having to know how to run an encryption program explicitly. Furthermore, we are able to encrypt the email transmission session, protecting such information as sender and recipient identities. The speed and simplicity of ssmail make it a very useful addition to widely deployed ESMTP mailers. Our solution can also be adopted easily by other mailers, and can be extended to use other encryption algorithms...|$|R
