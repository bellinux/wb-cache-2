50|$|The {{ability to}} modify schema {{definition}} in one level without affecting schema definition {{in the next}} higher level is called <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b> There are two levels of <b>data</b> <b>independence,</b> they are Physical <b>data</b> <b>independence</b> and Logical <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the core}} {{problems}} in soft computing is dealing with uncertainty in data. In this paper, we revisit the formal foundation of a class of probabilistic databases with the purpose to (1) obtain <b>data</b> model <b>independence,</b> (2) separate metadata on uncertainty and probabilities from the raw data, (3) better understand aggregation, and (4) create more opportunities for optimization. The paper presents the formal framework and validates <b>data</b> model <b>independence</b> by showing how to a obtain probabilistic Datalog {{as well as a}} probabilistic relational algebra by applying the framework to their non-probabilistic counterparts. We conclude with a discussion on the latter three goals...|$|R

50|$|The {{final stage}} of {{database}} design {{is to make the}} decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like. This is often called physical database design. A key goal during this stage is <b>data</b> <b>independence,</b> meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical <b>data</b> <b>independence</b> and logical <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b> Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.|$|E

40|$|Stroke {{patients}} {{have a higher}} risk of falling due to gender, age, postural sway, medications, cognitive status, changes in motor function, changes in sensory function, and nocturia (Zbobysz, 2005). Staff's lack of awareness of pre-disposing factors of falling or apathy to the issue is affecting patient safety. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the occurrence of falls and factors that predict on admission risk for falls. The theoretical framework is Patla and Shumway-Cook Measures of Environmentally Determined Mobility Disability (2002). The sample will include 420 stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation center at a Midwestern, acute care hospital. Instrument will be the Uniform <b>Data</b> Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure and information obtained related to stroke patient falls. The Uniform <b>Data</b> System Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure (FIM) scores that are recorded on rehab admission will measure functional status. The study will examine data from 2004 - 2007 related to stroke admission FIM scores and patient falls. The relationship between admission FIM scores (cognitive and motor) and the incidence of falls during the first 5 days of an inpatient rehabilitation stay will be measured to better predict a patient's risk of falling.

5000|$|Logical <b>data</b> <b>independence</b> is {{the ability}} to modify the logical schema without causing {{application}} program to be rewritten. Modifications at the logical level are necessary whenever the logical structure of the database is altered (for example, when money-market accounts are added to banking system). Logical <b>Data</b> <b>independence</b> means if we add some new columns or remove some columns from table then the user view and programs should not change. For example: consider two users A & B. Both are selecting the fields [...] "EmployeeNumber" [...] and [...] "EmployeeName". If user B adds a new column (e.g. salary) to his table, it will not effect the external view for user A, though the internal schema of the database has been changed for both users A & B.|$|E
50|$|The ANSI-SPARC model however {{never became}} a formal standard.

5000|$|Logical data independence: The {{ability to}} change the logical (conceptual) schema without {{changing}} the External schema (User View) is called logical <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b> For example, the addition or removal of new entities, attributes, or relationships to the conceptual schema sternal schemas or having to rewrite existing application programs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ratio of}} the diffractive {{production}} to the total cross section in DIS is computed {{as a function of}} the produced mass. The analysis is based on the solution to the non-linear evolution equation for the diffraction dissociation in DIS. The obtained ratios almost do not depend on the central mass energy in agreement with the HERA experimental <b>data.</b> This <b>independence</b> is argued to be a consequence of the scaling phenomena displayed by the cross sections. As a weakness point a significant discrepancy between the data and the obtained results is found in the absolute values of the ratios. Several explanatory reasons are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Sample entropy (SampEn) is a {{modification}} of approximate entropy (ApEn), used for assessing the complexity of physiological time-series signals, diagnosing diseased states. SampEn has two advantages over ApEn: <b>data</b> length <b>independence</b> and a relatively trouble-free implementation. Also, {{there is a small}} computational difference: In ApEn, the comparison between the template vector (see below) {{and the rest of the}} vectors also includes comparison with itself. This guarantees that probabilities [...] are never zero. Consequently, it is always possible to take a logarithm of probabilities. Because template comparisons with itself lower ApEn values, the signals are interpreted to be more regular than they actually are. These self-matches are not included in SampEn.|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{improves the}} application conditions of BN: big <b>data</b> and variable <b>independence.</b> In other words, the improved model can assess risk with BN {{in the case}} of incomplete data and correlated indicators. But there are also shortcomings in one respect—the optimal CPT obtained by GA must be derived from existing assessment truth, which to a certain extent limits use of the model.|$|R
5000|$|Physical <b>data</b> <b>independence</b> is {{the ability}} to modify the {{physical}} schema without causing application programs to be rewritten. Modifications at the physical level are occasionally necessary to improve performance. It means we change the physical storage/level without affecting the conceptual or external view of the data. The new changes are absorbed by mapping techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Physical data independence: The {{ability to}} change the {{physical}} schema without changing the logical schema is called physical <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b> For example, a change to the internal schema, such as using different file organization or storage structures, storage devices, or indexing strategy, should be possible without having to change the conceptual or external schemas.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{advantage}} of databases is <b>data</b> <b>independence.</b> It means we can change the conceptual schema at one level without affecting the data at another level. It also means we can change {{the structure of a}} database without affecting the data required by users and programs. This feature was not available in the file oriented approach.|$|E

The likelihood function of the proposed model involves the approximation of a high dimensional integral. To overcome numerical difficulties a pairwise likelihood approach is adopted.
