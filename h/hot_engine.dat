5|$|On 24 July, the {{squadron}} {{moved to a}} satellite airfield at Rochford in the county of Essex. The following day, he became operational. The Battle of Britain was slowly escalating and air fighting increased {{with a series of}} German air attacks against British shipping in the English Channel, a phase of the battle termed Kanalkampf by the Luftwaffe. Finucane's first scramble came on 25 July 1940. Flying Spitfire N3128 code YT-W, he took off at 08:45. The Spitfire was worn, having served in combat since April. It developed a glycol leak whilst climbing and the cockpit filled with escaping vapour from the cooling liquid condensing on the <b>hot</b> <b>engine.</b> Suddenly his radio transmission failed. Still, he managed a wheels-up landing at Rochford. 65 Squadron was in action again at 12:20 and engaged enemy aircraft but suffered no losses.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of small-capacity, high-speed diesel engines in the 1930s and 1940s, led to <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> falling dramatically out of favour. The last large-scale manufacturer of <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> stopped producing {{them in the}} 1950s and they are now virtually extinct in commercial use, except in very remote areas of the developing world. An exception to this is marine use; <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> were widely fitted to inland barges and narrowboats in Europe. The United Kingdom's first two self-powered [...] "motor" [...] narrowboats—Cadbury's Bournville I and Bournville II in 1911—were powered by 15 horsepower Bolinder single-cylinder <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines,</b> and this type became common between the 1920s and the 1950s. With <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> being generally long-lived and ideally suited to such a use, {{it is not uncommon}} to find vessels still fitted with their original <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> today.|$|R
25|$|The {{advantage}} of alkyl aluminium and similar compounds {{is the high}} content of carbon and hydrogen, resulting in bright emission lines similar to spectral signature of burning jet fuel. Controlled content of solid combustion products, generating continuous black body radiation, allows further matching of emission characteristics to the net infrared emissions of fuel exhaust and <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> components.|$|E
25|$|The newest {{generation}} of the FIM-92 Stinger uses a dual IR and UV seeker head, which allows for a redundant tracking solution, effectively negating the impact of modern decoy flares (according to the U.S. Department of Defense). While research and development in flare technology has produced an IR signature on the same wavelength as <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust, modern flares still produce a notably (and immutably) different UV signature than an aircraft engine burning kerosene jet-fuel.|$|E
25|$|According to {{internal}} GM documents, the ultimate culprit {{appears to be}} operating vehicles {{for long periods of}} time with low coolant levels. The low coolant is caused by pressure caps that fail in the open position. (The new caps and recovery bottles were introduced at the same time as DEX-COOL). This exposes <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> components to air and vapors, causing corrosion and contamination of the coolant with iron oxide particles, which in turn can aggravate the pressure cap problem as contamination holds the caps open permanently.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hot</b> tube <b>engine</b> [...] is a {{relative}} of the <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine</b> with better timing control. The <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine</b> only ran well at one speed- and a low one at that, typically 100 RPM. The timing of a <b>hot</b> tube <b>engine</b> is controlled by means of varying {{the length of the}} Hot-tube ignitor, which is longer and thinner than the hot bulb on a <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine.</b> Length of the tube controls when the charge ignites, and allows different operating speeds to be selected. If made variable, this makes for adjustable engine speed, but also induces a mechanical weakness in the engine which tends to lead to failure. Both engine types are now replaced by diesels, which can be made to operate over varying loads and speeds in any size with modern methods. Hot bulbs are still used in remote areas where the extreme fuel flexibility is a major advantage. <b>Hot</b> tube <b>engines</b> may also be found there, if their difficulties with the adjustable tube can be overcome, or accepted and lived with.|$|R

2500|$|Asphalt is {{typically}} stored and transported at temperatures around [...] Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated {{out of the}} mixture. This mixture is often called [...] "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, {{as well as some}} handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns.|$|E

In the second generation Prius, electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> coolant from a coolant thermos before {{the internal combustion engine}} is started. The delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds. The third generation Prius does not have a coolant thermos. Instead, the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat. A button labelled [...] "EV" [...] maintains Electric Vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than [...] This permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under [...] The car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted. Prior to the 2010 model, the North American model did not have the [...] "EV" [...] button, although the [...] "EV" [...] mode is still supported internally by the Prius Hybrid Vehicle management computer.|$|E

2500|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} various {{models of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating [...] of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of [...] Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> casing which could reach temperatures of 600°C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} it meant mischief. Every purple flush of its hideous body told me so. The vague, goggling eyes which were turned always upon me were cold and merciless in their viscid hatred. I dipped the nose of my {{monoplane}} downwards to escape it. As I did so, as quick as a flash there shot out a long tentacle from this mass of floating blubber, and it fell as light and sinuous as a whip-lash {{across the front of}} my machine. There was a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the <b>hot</b> <b>engine,</b> and it whisked itself into the air again, while the huge flat body drew itself together as if in sudden pain. I dipped to a vol-pique, but again a tentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller as easily as it might have cut through a smoke wreath. A long, gliding, sticky, serpent-like coil came from behind and caught me round the waist, dragging me out of the fuselage. I tore at it, my fingers sinking into the smooth, glue-like surface, and for an instant I disengaged myself, but only to be caught round the boot by another coil, which gave me a jerk that tilted me almost on to my back.|$|E

50|$|Cooling systems usually employ air (air-cooled) or liquid (usually water) cooling, {{while some}} very <b>hot</b> <b>engines</b> using {{radiative}} cooling (especially some rocket engines).

50|$|To create even {{combustion}} {{throughout the}} multiple hot bulbs in multi-cylinder engines is difficult. The <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine's</b> low compression ratio {{in comparison to}} diesel engines limited its efficiency, power output and speed. Most <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> could run at a maximum speed of around 100 rpm, while by the 1930s high-speed diesel engines capable of 2,000 rpm were being built. Also, due {{to the design of}} hot bulb and the limitations of current technology in regard to the injector system, most <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> were single-speed engines, running at a fixed speed, or in a very narrow speed range. Diesel engines can be designed to operate over a much wider speed range, making them more versatile. This made these medium-sized diesels a very popular choice for use in generator sets, replacing the <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine</b> as the engine of choice for small-scale power generation.|$|R
