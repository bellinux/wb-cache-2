50|$|T. spinosa pods are an {{excellent}} source of environmentally friendly tannins (tara tannins) most commonly used in the manufacture of automotive and furniture leathers. This growing industry is developing around their production in Peru. Some producers have their own plantations to guarantee constant quality. Tara tannin derivatives are being proposed as antifouling against marine organisms that can grow on ship hulls. Those tannins are of the hydrolysable type. Gallic acid is the main constituent of tara tannins (53%) and can be easily isolated by alkaline hydrolysis of the plant extract. Quinic acid is also a constituent of the tara tannins. Its tannines are colourless or light making them suitable a pre-mordant in the dyeing of cotton and other cellulose fibres.Tara gum is a white or beige, nearly odorless powder that is produced by separating and grinding the endosperm of T. spinosa seeds. Tara gum consists of a linear main chain of (1-4)-β-D-mannopyranose units attached by (1-6) linkages with α-D-galactopyranose units. The major component of the gum is a galactomannan polymer similar to the main components of guar and locust bean gums that are used widely in the food industry. The ratio of mannose to galactose in tara gum is 3:1. Tara gum has been deemed safe for human consumption as a food additive.Tara gum is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in a number of food applications. A solution of tara gum is less viscous than a guar <b>gum</b> <b>solution</b> of the same concentration, but more viscous than a solution of locust bean gum. Generally, tara gum presents a viscosity around 5,500 cps (1% aqueous solution). Furthermore, tara gum shows an intermediate acid stability between locust bean gum and guar gum. It resists the depolymerisation effect of organic acids down to a pH of 3.5. This gum is also stable to high-temperature treatment, up to 145 °C in a continuous process plant. Blends of tara with modified and unmodified starches can be produced which have enhanced stabilization and emulsification properties, and these are used in the preparation of convenience foods, such as ice cream.|$|E

The influence of the dimensionless quantities; namely the Reynolds number, Re, the Weber number, We, and the drag co-efficient, cd, are identified for {{the determination of the}} bubble rise velocity. The effect of these dimensionless groups together with the Eötvös number, Eo, the Froude number, Fr, and the bubble deformation parameter, D, on the bubble rise velocity and bubble trajectory are analysed. The experimental results show that the average bubble velocity increases with the increase in bubble volume for xanthan gum crystal suspensions. At high We, Eo and Re, bubbles are spherical-capped and their velocities are found to be very high. At low We and Eo, the surface tension force is significant compared to the inertia force. The viscous forces were shown to have no substantial effect on the bubble rise velocity for 45 < Re < 299. The results show that the drag co-efficient decreases with the increase in bubble velocity and Re.

The influence of operational conditions (agitation rate and inoculum volume) on gum production and rheological properties of gums from the Xanthomonas strains were investigated. Results: The isolated strain of Xanthomonas showed similar xanthan yield compared to the standard strain. Furthermore, this study clearly confirmed that gum yield depended on bacterial strain, agitation rate, and inoculum size. The most suitable conditions for the gum production in an orbital shaker in terms of agitation rate and inoculum size were 180 rpm and 5 %, respectively, resulting in an average production of 10. 96 and 11. 19 g/L for X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria and X. campestris DSM 19000, respectively.

Massecuite is a fluid made from sugar crystals and sugar syrup (molasses) and is an important phase in raw sugar processing where vacuum pan (large cylindrical vessels with steam bubble rising through vertical heating surfaces) is used for sugar crystallisation. To study the bubble rise characteristics and their effect on flow in vacuum pan, various-suspensions were made by using different concentration of xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>solutions</b> with polystyrene crystal particles. The rheological properties for the solutions were measured using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) and the bubble size and bubble trajectory were measured {{using a combination of}} non-intrusive-high speed photographic method and digital image processing. A combination of different concentration of xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>solutions</b> with different concentrations of polystyrene crystal mixed with water were tested and characterized for the selection of the massecuite equivalent non-Newtonian fluid. The rheological results indicated that xanthan gum crystal suspensions exhibited shear thinning Power-Law flow behaviour and the solution with a concentration of 0. 05 % xanthan gum and 1 % crystal showed the closest similarities to the rheological properties of massecuite at low shear rate. The viscous effects of the xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>solutions</b> were more pronounced than elastic effects and this phenomenon was observed for a high grade massecuite solution. The loss modulus (G’’) and storage modulus (G’) of crystal suspensions were investigated. The effects of the crystal suspensions on the bubble rise flow characteristics are discussed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the work reported in {{this paper is to}} determine if saliva addition has an effect on the rheology of xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>solutions.</b> The reasons for the interest was that it has been previously reported that flavour release from high viscosity xanthan thickened foods is not reduced {{in the same way as}} foods thickened by other hydrocolloids at comparable viscosities. It was previously postulated that this could be due to an interaction between saliva and xanthan that could change the microstructure and rheology of xanthan solutions. In this work the effect of saliva on the rheology of CMC and xanthan solutions was compared. Solutions of molecularly dissolved xanthan gum and CMC mixed with water or human whole saliva at a ratio of 5 : 1 showed little impact of the presence of saliva on steady shear or dynamic viscosity for the two hydrocolloids. In filament thinning experiments saliva addition significantly increased filament break-up time for xanthan gum while it had little effect on the break-up time of the CMC filament. Also, filament thinning appeared a lot less even and was not as reproducible in the case of xanthan gum. Addition of CMC and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) to xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>solutions</b> showed a similar increase in break-up time to saliva, but to see this effect the viscosity of the added CMC or HPMC solution had to be very much higher than the viscosity of saliva.

Good agreement was found at low concentrations (0. 01 wt % ≈ 0. 17 c*, where c* is the polymer overlap concentration), and this technique allowed for relaxation times on the order of 1 ms to be measured for solutions with shear viscosities of 2 mPa·s. Both the shear and (apparent) steady-state extensional viscosities of this set of industrially relevant fluids exhibited two regions of dependency on polymer concentration: linear up to concentrations of 0. 2 wt % (c/c* ≈ 3) and power law thereafter, where interchain interactions became significant. The extracted relaxation times followed the same trend (i. e., having a near linear dependency on concentration up to 0. 2 wt % and a power-law dependency on concentration up to 9 c*). The results indicate that the transition from dilute to semidilute behavior occurs at a nominal concentration of 3 c* instead of c*.
