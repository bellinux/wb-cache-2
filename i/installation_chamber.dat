40|$|Work {{carried out}} for this paper {{involves}} the measurement of ventilation rate through a specially designed (test <b>installation)</b> <b>chamber</b> (2. 8 m 3), with a 45 cm diameter fan at either end. Ventilation rate is measured via a unique rotary impeller designed in Leuven. Pressure and temperature are also recorded. The test installation has been designed and built {{in order to develop}} and evaluate new control algorithms for regulating the airflow rate, and to study the dynamic influence of pressure changes that act as a disturbance on the ventilation rate generated by the fans. The test installation has been built at the Laboratory for Agricultural Buildings Research, Leuven University, Belgium. A series of step input experiments, with varying degrees of disturbance were carried out in order to identify and estimate a transfer function (TF) model of the system using the Simplified Refined Instrumental Variable (SRIV) algorithm. The average control model obtained in this manner is utilised {{in the development of a}} Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) control system. Finally, Monte Carlo analysis is employed to demonstrate the robustness of the controller over most of the operating regime...|$|E
40|$|Icara-Icara is a {{reworking}} of the Icarus myth. The work {{is structured}} as a non-narrative set of symbolic material arranged in cyclical form, and is conceived {{to provide a}} new and enlarged meaning of an important myth that touches on some fundamental themes of timeless relevance. Alternative interpretations and outcomes are explored by substituting a female protagonist who, unlike Icarus, decides to fly at night. The particular design of the <b>installation</b> <b>chamber</b> and {{the arrangement of the}} screens are unique to this work ??? the aim is to go beyond the flatness of the video format, exploiting several perceptual strategies to provide, instead, a tri-dimensional audio-visual environment for an immersive (and even inclusive) audience experience. The particular angle and distance of the projection walls envelops the viewer and gives rise to a "stereo" image ??? two separate streams of visual information that are channelled discretely through each eye and are then re-combined in the brain. The large mirror covering the entire back wall further augments audience participation by reflecting at once the viewers and the two screens, thus placing the viewers right inside the screened images and making them, effectively, part of the artwork. Four channels of surround audio are delivered by speakers concealed in the chamber???s walls. The soundtrack takes the practice of sound design to a higher level ??? not bound by notions of ???realism??? in matching sounds and visual events, but free to explore metaphorical correspondences to convey directly states of mind, situations, and symbolical connections. The audio is produced with a special emphasis on auditory spatial information designed to draw the audio-viewer {{in the midst of the}} screened events ??? from the claustrophobic setting of the protagonist???s suburban dwelling to the limitless space of the open sky...|$|E

The first opera, Fidelio, began in 2001, and is a visual diary of Boyd's travels, from his visits with celebrities from Andy Warhol's Factory in New York City, to his escapades in New York and London nightclubs. The second opera, Romantika, is inspired by and dedicated to a hometown love interest, whom Boyd credits with mending his broken heart. Each opera will consist of a series of eleven separate exhibitions, totaling twenty-two exhibitions in all. Since 2005 Boyd has exhibited smaller <b>installations,</b> <b>Chamber</b> Music, whose themes complement and support the opera.|$|R

40|$|Sixteen open-top {{chambers}} (diameter, 3. 66 m) {{were established}} in a scrub oak habitat in central Florida where vegetation was removed in a planned burn prior to <b>chamber</b> <b>installation.</b> Eight control <b>chambers</b> have been continuously exposed to ambient air and eight have been continuously exposed to elevated CO 2 at twice-ambient concentration (∼ 700 ppm) for 5 years. Soil cores were collected from each chamber to examine the influence of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on the fungal community in different soil fractions. Each soil sample was physically fractionated into bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and roots for separate analyses. Changes in relative fungal biomass were estimated by the ergosterol technique. In the bulk soil and root fractions, a significantly increased level of ergosterol was detected in the elevated CO 2 treatments relative to ambient controls. Fungal community composition was determined by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The specificities of different ITS primer sets were evaluated against plant and fungal species isolated from the experimental site.

40|$|September 19 th 2015 the exhibition/installation Multistable Fields {{opened in}} the atrium of the main {{building}} at Lund university. Here’s the synopsis:The main building of Lund University was inaugurated in 1882. In the building conceived by architect Helgo Zettervall the rational quest for knowledge of Academia is enmeshed with a world of mythical symbols. Sphinxes and griffins meet deans and professors. Suggestive symbolism and ornamentation inspired by the worlds of classical antiquity meet contemporary rituals and processes. The exhibition Multistable Fields by Robert Willim has been specially made for the atrium of the building. It is based on two works (In Praise of Other Places and Chambers – Atrium/Pyramid) that emphasise tensions in the meetings between academic knowledge and the unknown. In these meetings some dimension merge and generates new knowledge and values, while other dimensions remain estranged. Like {{in the interpretation of}} multistable images and fields constant shifts of perspective are required to create meaning and understanding. The work with the exhibition has been guided by thoughts on ethnographic surrealism. In Praise of Other Places is a series of prints based on altered images extracted from the timeline of the audiovisual performance Possible Worlds. The performance was a commissioned work for the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm in 2014, which has since then led to a number of iterations. The aim was to let the artist examine the ways museums and ethnography take part in the rendition of worlds and how imagination and mediation is in constant interplay. How can dreamlike fragments of other places be evoked through altered layered compositions? The images in the series consist of interweaved layers that have been transmuted using digital and analog techniques. Everything from light reflections to the limitations of various file formats have left media-specific traces and influenced the transmutation process, hereby making the interplay between enhancement and distortion intrinsic to the work. One of the images, in which a symmetrical object appears, differs from the others. The object recurs in a number of Willim’s works. The sound <b>installation</b> <b>Chambers</b> – Atrium/Pyramid is based on site-specific sounds, composed to reshape the aural space and to generate a dreamlike ambience. The sound used has been recorded in the atrium {{as well as in the}} anechoic chamber, which is part of Humanities lab at the university. The sounds recorded in the anechoic chamber stem from the object that appears in one of the images of the exhibition. The sounds have been convolved with reverberation from the King’s chamber in the great pyramid at Giza...|$|R
