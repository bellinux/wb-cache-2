5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} January 2004, {{an active}} phase of the Madden–Julian {{oscillation}} exited {{the east coast of}} Africa and fueled convection (thunderstorms) near Madagascar, beginning on January20. This pulse, the strongest of the season, was also responsible for generating cyclones Frank and Linda. The thunderstorms coalesced in the Mozambique Channel between Madagascar and Mozambique on January24, <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> surge in the monsoon. That day, the Météo-France meteorological office in Réunion designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 06. The surge also increased wind shear in the region, which displaced the convection from the circulation. Drifting southwestward at first, the system became more defined, culminating with a marked increase in thunderstorms on January26. That day, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Elita near Juan de Nova Island. On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 09S.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E

25|$|In {{his annual}} address to Congress on December 2, 1845, Polk {{recommended}} giving the British the required one-year {{notice of the}} termination of the joint occupation agreement. Democratic expansionists in Congress from the Midwest, led by Senators Lewis Cass of Michigan, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and William Allen of Ohio, called for war with the United Kingdom rather than accepting anything short of all of Oregon up to Parallel 54°40′ north.

The Wolverines called timeout after a Henne pass completion with the clock stopped at :28. Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr called the officials over, and after a protest by Carr and a long conference, the officials reset the game clock to 0:30. Those extra two seconds would turn out to impact the outcome of the game. Six plays later, with 0:01 on the clock, Michigan would score the game-winning touchdown on a Henne pass to Mario Manningham.|$|E

In tandem with the rushing attack <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> strong offensive line, one writer asserted that they would enjoy [...] "easy pickings" [...] against a mediocre Arkansas State defense. Unlike the Ball State offense, Arkansas State's offense focused predominantly on the rushing attack, to which both dual-threat quarterback Adam Kennedy and running back Michael Gordon contributed. Ball State's defense was average in terms of points allowed, but poor in terms of yards allowed. Ball State was a 9.5 point favorite to win the game, and was the predicted winner among most sportswriters.|$|E

500|$|The Oi! {{movement}} was <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sense that many {{participants in the}} early punk rock scene were, {{in the words of}} the Business guitarist Steve Kent, [...] "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic... and losing touch". According to Bushell, [...] "Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue, and in reality most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [...] came from, it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music." [...] Lester Bangs described Oi! as [...] "politicized football chants for unemployed louts". One song in particular, the Exploited's [...] "Punks Not Dead", spoke to an international constituency. It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as bandas; one banda named itself PND, after the song's initials.|$|E
500|$|... "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] was {{inspired}} by a woman Betts was involved with in Macon, the girlfriend of musician Boz Scaggs. [...] "She was Hispanic and somewhat dark and mysterious—and she really used it to her advantage and played it to the hilt," [...] said Betts. To cloak her identity, the song is named after a headstone Betts saw at the Rose Hill Cemetery, where band members often ventured in their early days to relax and write songs. Considerable legend developed about the song's genesis, much <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> put-on interview Duane Allman gave Rolling Stone. The song is Betts' first composition recorded by the band. [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] was the band's rearrangement of a Muddy Waters tune culled from bassist Berry Oakley and Betts' days performing the number in their earlier band the Second Coming. Featuring Oakley in his only studio vocal, it is nearly twice as fast as Waters' original. [...] "Please Call Home" [...] was cut in New York with jazz producer Joel Dorn in two takes, with Johanson switching from brushes to a mallet on the second, final take. [...] "Leave My Blues at Home" [...] contains hints of funk and an extended fade out of the band's signature twin lead guitars." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1920s saw a {{population}} boom in South Florida {{that created the}} Florida land boom <b>fueled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> demand for land described by author Michael Grunwald as [...] "insanity". Land was sold before any homes or structures were built on it, {{and in some cases}} before any plans for construction were in place. New landowners, eager to make good on their investments, hastily constructed homes and small towns on recently drained land. Mangrove trees on the coasts were taken down for better views and replaced with shallow rooted palm trees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on larger canals to control the rising waters in the Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued to rise and fall, the region was covered with rain, and city planners continued to battle the water. The 1926 Miami Hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee levees to fail; hundreds of people who had just moved in south of the lake drowned. Two years later, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane claimed 2,500lives when Lake Okeechobee once again surged over its levees. Politicians who declared the Everglades uninhabitable were silenced when a four-story wall, the Herbert Hoover Dike, was built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut off the water source from the Everglades.|$|E
