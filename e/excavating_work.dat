50|$|Originally, Berowra Waters Inn was a {{guest house}} dating to the 1930s CE. In 1975, the Inn was {{purchased}} by Tony and Gay Bilson. The Edwardian style teahouse had major engineering flaws however and {{a decision was made}} to close and redesign the venue. Between 1976 and 1983, the architect Glenn Murcutt redesigned the property using a 'distinctive Australian vernacular style: corrugated tin roof over glass louvre windows, on a Sydney sandstone base, set among eucalypts and angophoras". During <b>excavating</b> <b>work</b> for the rebuild, Indigenous Australian (Aboriginal) midden remains on the property boundary were discovered. These were radiocarbon dated and found to date back nearly 10,000 years, indicating a long term human association with the location.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} {{designated}} as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1919 {{and is now in}} the care of Cadw. It has a variety of ruins. The only substantive structure remaining of the monastery is the main entrance archway. The Great West Door to the Abbey Church has low walls marking the extent of the church and its six subsidiary chapels. A modern roof protects an area of <b>excavated</b> <b>work</b> medieval tiling. The small on-site museum has some of these tiles on display. One of the best-known is one depicting a medieval gentleman admiring himself in a mirror.|$|R
5000|$|Excavations of {{settlements}} have revealed possible changes in social structures, {{and to what}} extent life in Britain continued unaltered in certain pockets into the early medieval period. Hilltops, the so-called [...] "hillforts", castra and monasteries have been <b>excavated.</b> <b>Work</b> on towns has been particularly important. Work on the hill-forts has shown evidence of refurbishment, and also of overseas trade, in this period. One of the earliest major excavations was at Tintagel (Radford 1939). This uncovered rectangular structures and much Mediterranean pottery. The buildings were initially interpreted as a monastery, but later as a princely stronghold and trading post. Another important excavation was at Dinas Powys (Alcock 1963) which showed evidence of metalworking. Alcock also led the excavations at South Cadbury (Alcock 1995). Many other sites have now been shown to have been occupied during the sub-Roman period, including Birdoswald and Saxon Shore forts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. If TBM {{does the}} <b>excavating</b> <b>work</b> in jointed rock mass, the {{cutterhead}} may be jammed. In order {{to decrease the}} loss, {{it is necessary to}} carry out risk evaluation. Whether the cutterhead is jammed or not depends on the relationship between torque and resistance torque. The magnitude of resistance torque depends on height of collapse, so according to the randomicity of height of collapse and probability theory, a formula for calculating the probability of cutterhead jamming is established. Meanwhile, according to the magnitude of resistance torque and cutterhead’s parameters, consequence of cutterhead jamming is divided into five ranks. Based on probability and consequence ranks, risk evaluation matrix for TBM’s cutterhead is proposed. The research results are demonstrated logically by the calculation of practical engineering...|$|E
5000|$|After Kletting {{produced}} more detailed plans, {{they were made}} available to contractors interested in bidding {{to work on the}} capitol. The submitted bids were opened December 3, 1912 at Salt Lake's Commercial Club with James Stewart & Company receiving the contract as general contractor on December 19, 1912. P. J. Morgan was awarded the contract for excavation and grading the site, and the capitol's groundbreaking ceremony took place December 26, 1912. A large amount of soil had to be excavated from the hill side, as {{the eastern side of the}} site was as high as the building's planned fourth story. The excavation was done using a steam shovel which dug into the hillside filling its large dipper, after which it turned around and emptied the dirt into a temporary Dinkey train. The small train then carried the soil to the nearby City Creek Canyon where it was dumped. [...] After the building's base was graded and <b>excavated,</b> <b>work</b> on the foundation started. The capitol was to be built of stone, with a concrete and steel superstructure.|$|R

50|$|After lengthy debate, the {{reconstruction}} {{and expansion of}} the bleachers (by some 1,900 seats) finally began after {{the close of the}} 2005 season, although it was strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. The first part of the process was to remove the outer brick wall, one of the last vestiges of the 1914 structure. Additionally, much of the 1937 construction behind the inner ivy-covered wall was removed (except for the steel supports and the center field upper tier) and the former sidewalk was <b>excavated.</b> The <b>work</b> progressed quickly throughout the winter, aided by the relatively mild Midwestern January.|$|R
50|$|Tunnels no. 2 and 3 {{are similar}} in {{construction}} to the long tunnel, but were completed under a separate contract {{at a cost of}} R9 million. Both of them had been partly <b>excavated</b> when <b>work</b> was suspended in 1949, the 1.1 km tunnel no. 2 to a distance of 583 m of which most was concrete lined, and the 1.2 km tunnel no. 3 to a distance of 467 m, but only lined in areas of poor ground. The contract called for both to be widened to new design standards to allow for overhead electrification and broader loading gauge clearances.|$|R
50|$|Given the {{announced}} {{development of}} the area of Miramar, a series of rescue investigations by Julio C. Tello were conducted between 1945 and 1950. Within the framework of this project, an area of 2000m by 200m was investigated, which revealed 1,570 tombs with 14,055 <b>excavated</b> objects.

50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{excavation of}} the mound {{took place in}} 1953 and 1954, {{under the supervision of}} a man known as Frank Van Wort; little of this excavation is known, because Van Wort published no reports of his work nor wrote any surviving unpublished reports. It appeared that he tried to dig through the middle of the mound but missed slightly to the northern side. A more systematic excavation was conducted in 1971 by Antioch College students under the supervision of archaeologist Wolfgang Marschall; under his work, Van Wort's work was exposed, and approximately one-third of the entire mound was <b>excavated.</b> Their <b>work</b> revealed the presence of a burial chamber {{at the heart of the}} mound.|$|R
