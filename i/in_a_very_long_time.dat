2500|$|The best {{performance}} of Greig's captaincy career came in 1976–77, when England toured India for a five-Test series. England had not won a Test {{series on the}} subcontinent for fifteen years and were clear underdogs against an Indian team that boasted {{some of the best}} spinners in the world and could count on the support {{of tens of thousands of}} vociferous fans who would fill the stadia. Greig made good use of his experience from his previous tour and consciously set out to build a rapport with the Indian crowd, for instance, playing 'dead' when loud firecrackers went off in the ground. [...] England went on to score one of their most convincing wins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> when they won the first three Tests by huge margins. Greig rated the win at Calcutta, when he scored 103 on a broken pitch, and struggling with a stomach bug, in front of 100,000 Indian fans, as the finest moment of his career. With 342 runs (at 42) and ten wickets, Greig had regained form to take with him to Australia.|$|E
