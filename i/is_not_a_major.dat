5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of mortality. In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E
5|$|When used at {{specified}} {{levels for}} water disinfection, {{the reaction of}} chlorine with water <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> concern for human health. Other materials present in the water may generate disinfection by-products {{that are associated with}} negative effects on human health.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the seaside}} location, few {{residents}} {{make their living}} on the sea, and fishing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E

5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{personal}} taxes in Nauru. The {{unemployment rate is}} estimated to be 90%, and of those who have jobs, the government employs 95%. The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to the economy.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which {{is comparable to the}} LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E

5|$|Other new {{features}} {{were added to}} the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games. Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> part of the game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map.|$|E
5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E

25|$|The town <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> retail centre, {{but there}} are three {{supermarkets}} – a SuperValu, Eurospar, and Lidl. As well as Eurospar, there are also three Spar convenience stores, Mace and a Tuthill's in Leixlip. The Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is a short drive down the N4, and Leixlip is also within easy reach of Dublin city centre's wide variety of shops, {{as well as the}} Blanchardstown shopping centre.|$|E
25|$|Alongside industries, {{agriculture}} is a thriving sector of Selangor's economy. Agriculture contributed to 3.1% of the state's GDP. Selangor {{is a significant}} state involved in the cultivation and growth of star fruits, papayas and bananas. While the state <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> producer of rice, the paddy fields in Kuala Selangor and Sabak Bernam {{contribute to the development}} of the district. Other agricultural activities that are conducted in Selangor include the establishment of palm oil and rubber plantation sites.|$|E
50|$|Although {{opposition}} to bans against head scarves and burqas had a vocal following, support for bans remained widespread and popular. That said, the issue <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> topic {{during the campaign}} preceding the June 10, 2007, federal elections.|$|R

25|$|The European Cricket Championship is a {{group of}} various tournaments in which {{national}} cricket sides throughout Europe compete. The competition is designed to encourage and develop the best players in countries where cricket <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> sport and Europe's only Test cricket playing country, England, does not currently enter a side. The games are 50-over one-day cricket matches. Most of these do not have One Day International status (see below for more details).|$|E
25|$|The Kibbie Dome officially seats just 16,000 for football, {{making it}} the second {{smallest}} venue in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A). A record crowd of 19,878 was recorded for the eightth consecutive rivalry game victory over Boise State in November 1989, during the schools' I-AA Big Sky era. The football field runs an unorthodox east-west, {{but even with the}} new translucent upper end walls (2009 and 2011), sun location <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> visibility issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} humans <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> feature of Egyptian {{creation}} stories. In some texts the first humans spring from tears that Ra-Atum or his feminine aspect, the Eye of Ra, sheds {{in a moment}} of weakness and distress, foreshadowing humans' flawed nature and sorrowful lives. Others say humans are molded from clay by the god Khnum. But overall, the focus of the creation myths is the establishment of cosmic order rather than the special place of humans within it.|$|E
50|$|A 1992 {{article in}} the journal Animal Welfare, found that color <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in adoptions at a Northern Ireland shelter; {{black-and-white}} coats were most prevalent among adopted dogs, followed by yellow, solid black, gold, and black-and-tan coats.|$|R
2500|$|LISP 1.5 – First widely {{distributed}} version, developed by McCarthy {{and others at}} MIT. So named because it contained several improvements on the original [...] "LISP 1" [...] interpreter, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> restructuring as the planned LISP 2 would be.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the state}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> battleground, the war ruined the economy. Under conscription, all men aged 18–35 (later 45) were drafted for Confederate service. More than 60,000 served, {{and the state}} lost nearly one-third of the white male {{population}} of fighting age.|$|R
25|$|Age of {{acquisition}} is not {{as important}} in comprehension activities {{as it is in}} production activities. However, {{that is not to say}} that age of acquisition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in the proficiency of L2. In fact studies have determined late learners to be less proficient in L2 than early learners. Functional imaging methods have revealed that holding proficiency constant leads to age of acquisition not having a large influence on representation of L2 in the brain, but there are fewer individuals achieving high proficiency at later ages of acquisition.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a year-long self-imposed investigation in November 2015, Nestlé disclosed that seafood products sourced in Thailand were produced with forced labour. Nestlé <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia, but does some business in Thailand – primarily for its Purina cat food. The study found virtually all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand are exposed to the same risks of abuse in their supply chains. This type of disclosure was a surprise to many in the industry because international companies rarely acknowledge abuses in supply chains.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{fatherhood}} of God does {{appear in the}} Old Testament, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> theme. While the view of God as the Father {{is used in the}} Old Testament, it only became a focus in the New Testament, as Jesus frequently referred to it. This is manifested in the Lord's prayer which combines the earthly needs of daily bread with the reciprocal concept of forgiveness. And Jesus' emphasis on his special relationship with the Father highlights the importance of the distinct yet unified natures of Jesus and the Father, building to the unity of Father and Son in the Trinity.|$|E
50|$|But it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{success for}} General Mills, {{partially}} because the commercials, which many adult viewers considered annoying, actually overshadowed the cereal itself. The untimely delivery of toy dune buggies {{to be used}} in a promotion also doomed the cereal to failure.|$|R
