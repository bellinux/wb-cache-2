2500|$|Employers {{have been}} {{responsible}} for the fraudulent misrepresentations of their employees since the mid-nineteenth century, under the decision of Barwick v English <b>Joint</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Bank.</b> This liability was extended in the early 20th century, to cover fraudulent actions which were not of benefit to the employer, a previous requirement. Thereupon, the test for vicarious liability of fraud was whether it was within an employee's authority – either actual, or outwardly appearing – to carry out the fraudulent actions that he did. It was not enough that an employee merely asserted that he had supposed authority, however; the defrauded individual or company must have been assured or led to believe by the employer – or have inferred through standard dealings – that the employee in question had it.|$|E

50|$|The National Provincial Bank {{played a}} unique {{role in the}} {{development}} of commercial banking. Prior to the Act of 1826, English banks were permitted to have no more than six partners - hence the expression “private banks”. The only banks allowed to be <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> were the <b>Bank</b> of England and the Scottish banks (which operated under a different legal system). The leading campaigner for change was Thomas Joplin a Newcastle timber merchant “with local experience of banking disasters” and an observer of the greater stability of the nearby Scottish banks. The Act of 1826 permitted the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> but note issue was only allowed outside a radius of 65 miles of London. The 1826 Act was followed by the creation of new provincial <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> and conversions from existing private banks. Because of the prohibition on note issue in the London area, it was incorrectly assumed that the Act also prohibited <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> themselves, an ambiguity that was removed by the Bank Charter Act of 1833.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between the chartered <b>banks</b> and the <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> lay almost entirely {{on the issue of}} liability and its implications for the issuance of <b>bank</b> notes. The <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank’s debts to the full extent of their personal property. The formation of new <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> blossomed in 1835 {{in the aftermath of a}} parliamentary report by Dr Charles Duncombe, which established their legality here. Duncombe’s report drew in large part on an increasingly dominant banking orthodoxy in the United Kingdom which challenged the English system of chartered banks. Duncombe’s Select Committee on Currency offered a template for the creation of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> based on several successful British banks. Within weeks two Devonshire businessmen, Capt. George Truscott and John Cleveland Green, established the “Farmer’s Bank” in Toronto. The only other successful bank established under this law was [...] "The Bank of the People" [...] which was set up by Toronto's Reformers. The Bank of the People provided the loan that allowed William Lyon Mackenzie to establish the newspaper The Constitution in 1836 in the lead up to the Rebellion of 1837. Mackenzie wrote at the time: “Archdeacon Strachan’s bank (the old one)... serve the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer’s acres under the harrow of the storekeeper. You will be shewn how to break this degraded yoke of mortgages, ejectments, judgments and bonds. Money bound you - money shall loose you”. [...] During the financial panic of 1836, the Family Compact sought to protect its interests in the nearly bankrupt Bank of Upper Canada by making <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> illegal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{presidency}} banks dominated banking in India {{but there}} were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks.</b> All these banks operated in different segments of the economy. The exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, concentrated on financing foreign trade. Indian <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> were generally under capitalised and lacked the experience and maturity to compete with the presidency and exchange banks. This segmentation let Lord Curzon to observe, [...] "In respect of banking it seems we are behind the times. We are like some old fashioned sailing ship, divided by solid wooden bulkheads into separate and cumbersome compartments." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1835, Dr Charles Duncombe, a Reform {{politician}} in the Legislative Assembly, {{was part of}} a [...] "Select Committee on Currency" [...] that offered a template for the creation of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> based on several successful Scottish banks. The Scottish bank system had always differed from the English system.

The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The chartered banks would loan out many more banknotes (little more than bank issued I.O.U.s) than they had specie (legal tender) to exchange for those notes once redeemed. The more banknotes they loaned out the more interest they made, but at the increased risk of bankruptcy. Protected by limited liability, their shareholders put profit above risk.|$|R

40|$|First draft: do not quote Starting with a given initial {{distribution}} of wealth holders (who are potential wealth holders) we show {{the emergence of the}} formal sector consisting of <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> and informal sector consisting of indigenous bankers. In other words we highlight the endogenous creation of financial dualism. This captures the experience of the developed countries in Europe, especially U. K. and Germany, during their early days of development and also the experience of the developing countries like India. As these country experiences suggest the history of modern banking {{can be traced to the}} formation of the <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks,</b> which stand in contrast to the native bankers. Typically the <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> are initially formed by the local rich and attract deposits. The depositors belonging to the middle wealth segment. The native bankers on the other hand hardly ever in a position to receive deposits. The earlier chapters refer to the kind of financial dualism, which are more the outcome of government policies and regulation rather than a natural outcome of existing environment. We may broadly relate it to the “new financial dualism ” as coined by Myint. In contrast, in this chapter we consider the endogenous creation of financial dualism in the absence of government intervention...|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the English chartered banks and the Scottish <b>joint</b> <b>stock</b> <b>banks</b> is that the Scottish banks were considered partnerships and hence didn't need a legislated Act in order to operate.

The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The Scottish joint-stock banks followed a [...] "hard money policy." [...] They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive and freer from political influence and corruption.|$|R
