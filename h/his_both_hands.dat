40|$|Introduction: This article {{deals with}} two {{patients}} who underwent bilateral hand transplantation following amputation of both upper limbs at the distal {{third of the}} foream. Materials and Methods: The first patient {{had a history of}} loss of hands in a train accident, with possiblity of a run over element during the injury. The second patient lost <b>his</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> in a mine blast. The preoperative work up included detailed clinical and psychological evaluation. The donor retrieval was similar in both the cases and the donors were housed in our own instittution. The donor preparation, recipient preparation and the transplant procedure was similar except for the need of primary tendon transfers in the left hand of the first patient. Results: The first patient needed a free flap transfer to cover compromised skin flap on the left hand on the second day. The second hand transplant was uneventful. Both the recipients are now back to their normal daily routines. Conclusions: Hand transplantation is a potentially life altering procedure, but to optimise the results, it is imperative that there is a meticulous planning and diligent execution with utmost importance to the detail coupled with a synchronised team effort...|$|E

Teologia i mistagogia na dzisiaj), napisanej pod kierunkiem Prof. Paul De Clerck i Prof. Kristiaan Depoortere i obronionej w Instytucie Katolickim w Paryżu w 2005 r. This article {{discusses}} {{the elements of}} reconciliation present in the Eucharistic celebration, focusing in particular on deepening the mistagogical sense of the liturgical rite and the words of Eucharistic prayers for masses of reconciliation (EPR). Broadened horizons of our knowledge will help us to ultimately reach {{the depths of the}} richness of the mystery experienced in the Eucharistic celebration. We realize how ubiquitous the theme of reconciliation is in the Eucharistic liturgy by presenting the various forms of the penitential act, the apologies of the priest as well as the communion rites redolent of reconciliation. All of these seem to be crowned by the discussion of the theme of reconciliation present in the newest typical edition of the Roman missal (2002). The theme of reconciliation is present in a special way in the Eucharistic prayers for masses of reconciliation. The first EPR emphasizes man's call to holiness and presents the teandric dimension of reconciliation as a renewal of the Covenant and a means of rediscovering anew the way to the Father's home. The second EPR shows reconciliation in the horizontal dimension, where God the Father in his work of salvation stretches out <b>His</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> - the Son and the Holy Spirit - in order to transfigure the divided and torn humanity and lead it to perfect communion. The Eucharist is the fullest sacramental realization of Christ's salvation. In the context of the Eucharist celebrated with one of the two EPR, we are able {{to gain a better understanding}} of the fact that the contemporary Church feels responsible for the grand work of reconciliation with God, the neighbor, and the entire world. EPR is a very concrete answer to the needs of the Church at the threshold of the third millennium. AWSD w Białymstoku 71 - 11...|$|E
