40|$|Molybdenum disilicide {{has been}} {{predominantly}} used for furnace heating elements, but recently {{there has been}} interest in its use for high temperature structural applications. The reason for this increased interest stems from its desirable characteristics which are a high melting point, relatively low density, good oxidation resistance, relatively good thermal conductivity and electronically conductive. The melting point of MoSi{sub 2 } is approximately 2030 {degrees}C as compared to a melting point of 1340 {degrees}C for the Ni-based superalloys. This could potentially give MoSi{sub 2 } a big advantage over the Ni-based superalloys in turbine applications because the operating temperature can be increased resulting {{in an increase in}} turbine efficiency and reduced emissions. The relatively low density (6. 25 g/cm{sup 3 }) compared to the Ni-based superalloys (8. 9 g/cm{sup 3 }) is an important advantage in turbine applications because of the need for low weight. Good oxidation resistance stems from the ability of MoSi{sub 2 } to form a protective SiO{sub 2 } surface layer when exposed to oxygen. Another advantageous feature of MoSi{sub 2 } is its thermal conductivity which is superior to Ni-based superalloys at low temperatures and comparable to the Ni-based superalloys at high temperatures. This allows heat to be dissipated at a rate better than ceramics and comparable to metals. MoSi{sub 2 } is electrically conductive allowing it to be <b>electro</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>machined.</b> This is desirable since conventional ceramics are not generally conductive and cannot be <b>electro</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>machined...</b>|$|R
