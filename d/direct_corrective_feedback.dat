This {{study was}} designed to investigate student and teacher perception of four types of feedback: 1) <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> 2) <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> with written and oral meta linguistic explanation, 3) indicating and locating the students’ errors, and 4) indicating the students’ errors only. The study was conducted with 31 first-year university students and nine teachers at Koya University, College of Languages, English Department. The data were collected through a student questionnaire, which was filled in four times by the students after they had been given the four types of feedback, teacher and student interviews, and a journal, which was kept by the researcher while giving feedback. The results demonstrated that all the types of feedback were preferred by the students. However, there were some differences among them. According to the questionnaire <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> was approved most by the students, but according to the student and teacher interview and the researcher’s journal, <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> with written and oral meta linguistic explanation was liked most. Generally the two explicit types were preferred more than the implicit types. The study suggests that teachers ought {{to pay attention to the}} learners’ level of proficiency while giving feedback.

In doing so, it highlights a number of shortcomings in the design of some studies and explains {{what needs to be done}} in future research so that answers to the issues that have been raised can be effectively addressed. The article reports on a two-month study (with 144 international and migrant ESL students in Auckland, New Zealand) that investigated the extent to which different WCF options (<b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> written and oral meta-linguistic explanation; <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and written meta-linguistic explanation; <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> only; no corrective feedback) help students improve their accuracy in the use of two functional uses of the English article system (referential indefinite ‘a ’ and referential definite ‘the’). The study found (1) that students who received all three WCF options outperformed those who did not receive WCF, (2) that their level of accuracy was retained over seven weeks and (3) that there was no difference in the extent to which migrant and international students improved the accuracy of their writing as a result of WCF...|$|E

This study applied descriptive qualitative method. The data in this study was an English teacher of MAN Bahrul Ulum Tambak Beras Jombng. The teacher named Teacher A. It was found that there were three types of Corrective Feedback used by the teacher based on theory proposed by Ellis (2008) ‗A Typology of Written Corrective Feedback, they are <b>Direct</b> <b>Corrective</b> <b>Feedback,</b> Indirect Corrective Feedback and Focused Corrective Feedback. Moreover, the teacher also gave additional comment in the end of students‘ text and the teacher also left the students‘ errors in all of the students‘ writing. Based on the result of analysis, this study interviewed the teacher to know the reasons of using the types of corrective feedback. The teacher‘s reasons in using <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> was to make the students easier to know the correct forms, because the students would not correct their errors without discussion in the classroom. Meanwhile, in using Indirect Corrective Feedback, the teacher hoped that the students would do selfcorrection. The teacher also used Focused Corrective Feedback in correcting the students‘ works based on narrative genre, the reasons of giving this type was to match the tittle with the text. The teacher hoped that the students would be motivated by the teacher‘s comments. This study fitted the teacher‘s reasons proposed by Ellis (2008).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of different strategies {{of written corrective feedback}} in improving students' written accuracy. 20 students were recruited and divided into two groups, direct and indirect group. This study was conducted in 3 stages; pre-test, treatment, and post-test. Feedback was provided in treatment stage where group one students received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> while group two students received indirect corrective feedback. The errors made on each stage were marked and counted to be used to compare among each stage of their writings as well as between the two groups. The results showed that students who received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> outperformed students who received indirect corrective feedback in the post-test. In addition, the results also showed that although the mean number of errors made by indirect feedback group did not decrease in post-test, the mean number of errors made decrease in their revised texts. Thus, it can be concluded that indirect corrective feedback was an effective tool in helping students retaining their language learning over a period of time. Interviews were also conducted to gain insights on other factors that affect students’ writing performance. Based on the results gained, two themes which influence the effectiveness of written corrective feedback on students’ writing are motivation and scaffolding. Three anecdotal findings were also collected through the interviews. They are related to students expressing their concern on content-related knowledge when writing an essay. In addition, students also stated that teachers should apply mix strategies when correcting different types of errors made by the students based on the severity. Last, but not least, the interview also revealed the impact of students’ exam-orientedness on their language learning. The results of the study suggest that to some extent, written corrective feedback is effective in reducing students’ error in their writing.

Using a simplified adaptation of Sheen’s 2007 study, this study used three intact ESL classes to form three groups: direct-only WCF (DCF, n= 16), direct metalinguistic WCF (DME. n= 12), and the control group (n= 15). The study had a pretest-treatment-posttest-delayed posttest configuration with four CF treatment sessions and a short questionnaire survey with both experimental groups.

However, no difference was found between receiving direct-only WCF (DCF) and direct WCF with metalinguistic comments (DME). In terms of students’ perceptions of its usefulness, both experimental groups indicated that receiving focused direct WCF made it easier for them to notice their errors and that it made them think about the errors they made.

30|$|Debates on WCF {{are mainly}} fuelled by Truscott’s (1996) thought-provoking essay. In it, Truscott {{questions}} {{the efficacy of}} error correction as an instructional tool for L 2 writing. The key arguments of Truscott’s original essay (and its follow-ups) were as follows: (1) grammar correction practice goes against SLA theories; (2) existing evidence suggests that WCF has very little potential benefit for student writers; (3) the practical problems faced by teachers and students negate the usefulness of grammar correction; and (4) grammar correction is time consuming for both students and teachers (Truscott 1996, 1999, 2004, 2007). Truscott’s remarks have received strong rebuttals from many researchers. Ferris (1999, 2004) acknowledges that Truscott’s critiques highlight the complexities of WCF activities and the practical issues associated with them. However, he says that Truscott’s dismissal is unfounded since it simply neglects many empirical studies supporting the effectiveness of WCF. Based on comparative experimental studies, other researchers have demonstrated that WCF, if well designed and executed, is able to noticeably improve learners’ performance on certain grammatical structures (e.g., Bitchener 2008; Bitchener and Knoch 2010; Chandler 2003; Ellis et al. 2008; Hartshorn et al. 2010; Liu 2008; Nassaji 2011; Sheen 2007; Shintani et al. 2014; van Beuningen et al. 2012). A few recent examples of this research strand and their findings are as follows. Shintani et al. (2014) explored the effect of direct and metalinguistic feedback and found a stronger effect for the former than the latter. Bitchener (2008) reported that the students who received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> with written and oral meta-linguistic feedback, along with the group that received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> with no meta-linguistic feedback, outperformed the control group who did not receive any feedback whatsoever. Similarly, Abualsha’r and AbuSeileek (2014) found that the students who received corrective feedback delivered via computer about error types while writing essays performed significantly better {{than those who did}} not receive any corrective feedback whatsoever. Mawlawi Diab (2015) found that students receiving direct error correction and metalinguistic feedback outperformed students receiving only metalinguistic feedback. For example, the students who received direct error correction made fewer pronoun and lexical errors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Written {{corrective}} feedback {{in the realm}} of ESL/EFL has gained more attention from researchers in the last 10 years, and the latest innovation in the practice is the integration of video in the delivery of written {{corrective feedback}} (Stannard, 2008). However, research on video-based written corrective feedback (VWCF) in EFL/ESL writing instructions so far has only revealed its qualitative strengths (Stannard, 2008; Mathisen, 2012) —that is, in terms of students’ responses towards its application, a gap that the current paper intends to address. The present study reported in this paper is a classroom action research (CAR) aiming at increasing the writing accuracy of a group of students of a state university in Bali, Indonesia through the integration of video in the corrective feedback practice. The writing instruction in the study is carried out in a blended learning fashion combining the traditional learning mode with an email-based correspondence between the tutor and the students. The findings seem to indicate that video-taped orally-delivered <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> has a relatively small impact on student accuracy improvement percentage. However, the integration of video in the feedback provision appears to have a potential in terms of increasing students’ motivation in their learning of writing. The research results can provide some interesting insight to teachers who want to implement video-based feedback and future research on this type of feedback.

In this study, sixty high-proficient L 2 learners formed a control group and two experimental groups. One experimental group received focused written CF and the other experimental group received unfocused written CF, while the control group received no feedback. The statistical analyses indicated that both experimental groups did better than control group in the post-test, and moreover, focused group significantly outperformed unfocused one in terms of accurate use of definite and indefinite English articles. Overall, these results suggest that focused written CF is more effective than unfocused one, at least where English articles are concerned, in improving grammatical accuracy of high-proficient L 2 writers and thus strengthens the case for teachers providing focused written CF. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempted}} to systematically inspect {{the impact of}} <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>corrective</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on the writing ability of EFL learners when using product/process based instructions. To do so, 110 female EFL learners, {{between the ages of}} 15 and 18, were randomly assigned into four experimental groups to receive four different kinds of treatments, namely product-based instruction with direct feedback, product-based instruction with indirect feedback, process-based instruction with direct feedback, and process-based instruction with indirect feedback. The treatment took 10 sessions. Analyzing the results of the two writing tests (pretest and posttest) showed that direct feedback had significant effects on EFL learners' writing in process-based instruction and product-based instruction but indirect feedback failed to show any significant effect on EFL learners' writing in both process-based instruction and product-based instruction. The results also indicated that direct feedback had significantly better impact on EFL learners writing in the process-based instruction than product-based one...|$|R
40|$|This action {{research}} study explored and analysed {{the role of}} teacher <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in helping Grade 8 learners to improve the accuracy of their written English as their second language. Therefore, the goals {{of this study were}} to examine the kind of language errors my grade 8 learners’ made in their writing, to find out whether these errors could be categorized linguistically, and to determine if they were errors, mistakes or lapses. The study further analysed how learners responded to my feedback, and also determined which feedback strategies worked best to help my learners deal with their errors, mistakes or lapses. This study set out to look at six learners from one Grade 8 class of 40 learners. The data were gathered from six written essay scripts, and each learner wrote four essay draft revisions. The learners’ written essays were analysed by means of checklists in order to identify the types and patterns of errors made. Errors such as punctuation, past tense verbs, spelling and vocabulary were identified, analysed and categorized to provide insights into reasons underlying the instances in which they were committed. The findings of this study showed that factors underlying learners’ written errors included mother-tongue interference, overgeneralization, fossilization, translation, lack of concentration, and carelessness. The findings further showed that <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on learners’ draft revisions provided them with extensive exposure and practice in English, enabled them to internalize language rules, and reduced the tendency to commit errors in their writing. The findings further suggest that procedures such as multiple-draft activities, indirect <b>feedback,</b> <b>direct</b> <b>feedback,</b> focused <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> error correction and written <b>feedback</b> with explicit <b>corrective</b> comments improved their levels of writing. Furthermore, putting these procedures into practice and reflecting critically on how to apply them helped enrich my own teaching practices and development in relation to the provision of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> to improve accuracy in learners’ writing. The findings are discussed {{in the context of the}} related literature. This study should be read by ESL teacher-trainers, ESL teachers, ESL student-teachers and ESL learners/students in general...|$|R
40|$|Students’ {{language}} {{progress and}} their ability to acquire new knowledge is in direct connection to the feedback given to them by their educators. Written corrective feedback has been broadly studied during the last decades, yet, leaving the research results inconclusive. There has been a long-term debate about what type of feedback is most effective on EFL/ESL learners’ grammatical accuracy, and the present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of direct and indirect corrective feedback on grammar in written production. The study is a pre-test post-test error-analysis on 65 16 year-old Swedish EFL learners in upper secondary school. The results show that both the students receiving direct, and the students receiving indirect corrective feedback, made fewer grammatical errors on the post-test compared to the pre-test. The students that received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> made fewer grammatical errors on the post-test than the students that received indirect corrective feedback, but no statistical significance was found. Level of grammatical proficiency and its relation to the feedback given was also investigated, however, {{no significant differences were found}} between the groups. Finally, some pedagogical implications are made, teachers are advised to not be frightened of error correction, since its effectiveness is well established by this and previous research. Teachers are also encouraged to involve the students in the feedback process, by e. g. revision, and to learn more about their students’ needs, in order to give them the feedback they need. Lastly, some suggestions for further research are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the plausible impact of discourse marker (DM) instruction on its usage, and also on fluency, accuracy, and complexity improvement of Iranian intermediate EFL learners’ writing. To this aim, among the two hundred fourth year English major learners in Dezful University, Iran, fifty of them who were in the intermediate level, based on the scoring system of the university, were chosen. They were divided into the experimental and control groups. The experimental group experienced a twenty-hour intervention period on function and usage of DMs through a process of explicit instruction (EI) and input flood (IF), during which they received <b>direct</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (CF). The DM classification presented by Belles-Furtuno (2004), with some modifications to match the purpose of the current study, was selected to be taught to this group, including both micro and macro markers which can be applied in both sentential and supra-sentential levels. After intervention, both experimental and control groups were given a topic to write to elucidate if DM instruction could influence the use of these units. The results revealed that the experimental group used DMs more than the control group which means EI and IF, along with CF could have a positive impact on the use of these units. The next stage of the study was investigating the possible effect of EI and IF, with the help of CF, of DMs on fluency, accuracy, and complexity of writing. The experimental group was given topics prior to and following the intervention. To quantify the results the Wolfe-Quintero (1998) method was used. The data show that all the three components of writing improved after intervention, which suggest that DM instruction could enhance learners' writing in the three aspects. The findings can be used by teachers and syllabus designers to consider DM as one of the most crucial components in writing courses...|$|E

Feedback, including {{that which is}} corrective, allows supervisors to transmit knowledge to supervisees and communicate evaluations of supervisee performance. Despite {{the central role of}} feedback in clinical supervision, surprisingly little empirical attention has focused on supervisee experiences of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in clinical supervision. This study sought to provide a deeper understanding of supervisee experiences of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in clinical supervision. Twelve participants were interviewed regarding their experience of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in clinical supervision during predoctoral psychology internship. Participants expected to receive <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> and they held largely positive expectations/beliefs about <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> Despite positive expectations/beliefs about <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> participants discussed <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> events that went poorly and resulted in negative consequences for themselves, their clinical work, and/or the supervision relationship.

40|$|Educational {{assessment}} in Brunei Darussalam {{is currently in}} a period of change as it transitions from an emphasis on traditional assessment methods to School Based Assessment for Learning (SBAfL). This research investigated whether traditional feedback in the form of <b>direct</b> focused written <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (CF) or <b>direct</b> unfocused CF produced differential effects on the accurate use of grammatical forms by Bruneian secondary school ESL learners. The results were considered with regards to the aims of SBAfL. Using two secondary school ESL classes totaling 38 students, two groups were formed: a Focused written CF group (n= 19) and an Unfocused written CF group (n= 19). The results of a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test quasiexperiment indicated that there was no differential effect in the overall accuracy rate between either group. However, the unfocused group demonstrated a significant decline in their accurate use of the irregular past tense in the post-test, although this differential effect was not present in the delayed post-test. Overall, these findings suggested that both focused and unfocused written CF were of limited pedagogical value and raised questions about their use within an Assessment for Learning context...|$|R
