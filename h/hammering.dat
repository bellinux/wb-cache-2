5|$|The <b>hammering</b> of {{woodpeckers}} when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is <b>hammering</b> on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by <b>hammering</b> the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by <b>hammering</b> the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772. He {{succeeded in making}} malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia, precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and <b>hammering</b> the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E

The opening match resulted in a 10–0 <b>hammering</b> {{at the hands of}} Norway. The return match was less one-sided, finishing 2–0 to the Norwegians. A 4–1 defeat in Turkey saw San Marino score their first World Cup goal, and a 0–0 draw against the same opposition on 10 March 1993 gave them their first ever point. In their final qualifier, against England, Davide Gualtieri scored the then-fastest goal in World Cup Qualifying history—after 8.3 seconds—though the team went on to lose 7–1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the kinematics of the throw with the competition <b>hammer</b> (7. 26 kg) and the heavier <b>hammer</b> (8. 0 kg). Sixteen male <b>hammer</b> throwers threw <b>hammers</b> of both weights at maximum effort. Utilizing 3 high-speed video cameras (300 fps), three-dimensional coordinates of the <b>hammer</b> head and 25 landmarks on the body were obtained by the direct linear transformation method. <b>Hammer</b> head velocity and distance thrown with the heavier <b>hammer</b> were significantly lower than for the throw with the competition <b>hammer.</b> Durations of the turn and double support phase (DSP) in the throw with the heavier <b>hammer</b> were significantly longer than with the competition <b>hammer.</b> Focusing on changes in the velocity of the <b>hammer</b> head, the duration of acceleration with the heavier <b>hammer</b> during the 1 st and 2 nd turns was longer than for the competition <b>hammer.</b> The Y component of displacement of the center of gravity for the heavier <b>hammer</b> was longer in every phase than for the competition <b>hammer.</b> These results suggest that the throw with the heavier <b>hammer</b> can be an effective training method for acquiring a longer movement of the center of gravity toward the throwing direction during the DSP and longer acceleration of the <b>hammer</b> head...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than <b>hammering.</b> De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of <b>hammering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of <b>hammering</b> in 1585.|$|E

Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. Vacca turned Principe di Carignano and Castelfidardo to port, taking them away from the Austrian ships <b>hammering</b> Persano's division.

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and <b>hammering.</b> Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
