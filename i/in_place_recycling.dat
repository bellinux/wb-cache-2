HIPR is a process by which rehabilitation of the existing HMA pavement occurs on site in one operation. HIPR project selection, mix design, construction and testing are described. The HIPR process successfully rehabilitated the pavement on SR 542 while using less new material than a traditional HMA mill and fill. HIPR was found to reduce initial project cost and traffic disruptions were less than HMA paving. This project will be evaluated for five years at which time a final report documenting the HIPR performance will be produced. 17. KEY WORDS 18.

For the evaluation of the bearing capacity of the foamed asphalt treated recycled pavement, the NTUA Laboratory of Highway Engineering undertook research on the subject, including continuous monitoring of the pavement performance through detailed analysis. The trial field investigation was based primarily on non-destructive tests using the falling weight deflectometer (FWD) along several trial subsections of a rehabilitated pavement. According to the data analysis, the FWD was proven a useful tool for reliable assessment of the bearing capacity of recycled pavement. Deflection indicators give useful information about the structural condition of the recycled pavement, but more precise results are drawn with backanalysis and strain response analysis of the in-situ collected data. The distress {{in the body of the}} recycled layer is lower than expected, indicating adequate bearing capacity of the recycled pavement. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E

The use of vaguely defined criteria for the design of the recycled mix, the lack of criteria for construction control as well as of specifications about the end product, and the ignorance of the evolution of the material performance with time have given cold recycling some technical insecurity. In this article, the problems arising from the standard methodology used for the design of cold recycled mixes have been analysed firstly, as well as the effect that certain variables, compaction and curing especially, have on their properties. Secondly, the effect that the use of both emulsion and cement during recycling has on the mix properties has been studied, comparing the results with those obtained by means of the standard procedures where only emulsion or cement are used.

40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Two common {{methods of}} road pavement, {{granular}} material stabilisation used in road construction throughout South Africa today include Cold <b>in</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Recycling</b> (CIPR) and stabilisation with cement or bitumen and an active filler to create Bitumen Stabilised Materials (BSM). As {{part of the}} updating of the South African Pavement Design Method (SAPDM) an experimental section, investigating the structural capacity of cement and lime stabilised and BSM pavement layers, was constructed and will be monitored over a two year period. As part of this study Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements were taken on the various experimental stabilised pavement layers constructed. The FWD deflection data, measured at various time intervals over a 360 day period, forms {{the basis of the}} study presented here. The objective of this thesis was to identify typical back-calculated layer stiffnesses and their variability over time for the various in-situ recycled and stabilised base layers constructed within the experimental section. Stabiliser type, content and layer thicknesses were varied across experimental sub-sections. Trends in back-calculated stiffness of cement stabilised base layers consistently showed significant reductions in layer stiffness subsequent to construction traffic loading. Subsequent to the initial reduction in stiffness little change in stiffness was noted under normal traffic loads. Observations on the trends in back-calculated stabilised layer stiffness per material type over time indicated that seasonal moisture and temperature fluctuations {{have an effect on the}} stiffness of the pavement structure as a whole. BSM materials showed significant variability over time in-line with seasonal variability in the supporting subgrade stiffness in the southbound lane. BSM materials with 1 % cement added in the northbound lane show initial stiffness reductions due to direct rainfall application however a significant increase in layer stiffness occurs up to 360 days after construction. BSMs with 2 % cement in the northbound lane show significant increases in layer stiffness over the 360 day observation period. No significant difference in stiffness trend was observed between BSM emulsion a BSM foam materials. The BSM emulsion with 0. 9 % residual bitumen and 1 % cement was observed to show rapid reduction in stiffness upon opening to traffic and reverting to stiffness values similar to an unbound material of approximately 350 MPa. Cement and lime stabilised materials showed typical post 28 –day average stiffnesses per sub-section ranging between 600 MPa and 1800 MPa. BSM foam with 1 % cement added were observed to have average stiffnesses per sub-section in the range of 400 MPa to 2200 MPa and BSM emulsion with 1 % cement with stiffnesses between 400 MPa to 1700 MPa over the 360 day period. BSMs with 2 % cement added showed stiffness ranges between 900 MPa to 4300 MPa for BSM foam and 900 MPa to 3900 MPa for BSM emulsions over the 360 day period. The spatial variability of back-calculated stiffness per sub-section of a particular stabilisation design was significant and was observed, through the Co-efficient of Variation (COV), to increase over time. The effect of the observed variability when incorporated into a pavement design scenario, requiring a design reliability of 90 %, showed 50 % of the pavement structure would be overdesigned by a factor of 4. With respect to the current philosophies on the development of stiffness over time of cement and lime stabilised and BSM pavement layers some useful observations were made. Cement stabilised materials correlate well with stiffness development theories predicted by previous studies. Theories relating to the stiffness development of BSMs however did not predict the levels of variability in base layer stiffness observed on the experimental section. The continued observation of the experimental section for another year will give greater insight to the stiffness trends of the stabilised materials discussed above...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining a {{functioning}} road network {{is a challenge}} in today’s society due to the financial restrictions faced by all levels of government. A means of determining how to efficiently spend their limited funding must be found. In addition, the concept of sustainable development is rapidly growing in today’s world pressuring municipalities towards operating in a more socially and environmentally friendly manner. Sustainability is broken down into three aspects which are economical, social and environmental. A truly sustainable pavement satisfies its functional requirements while aiding social and economic development and minimizing negative environmental impacts In response to the growing sustainability trend, the City of Markham is committed to incorporating sustainability into their daily operations. This thesis {{is the result of}} a research project with the City of Markham which is directed at incorporating sustainable practices into pavement engineering. The objective of this project is to provide a practical framework for incorporating pavement sustainability best practices into the pavement engineering operations at the City of Markham. This practical framework is developed through the completion of four primary objectives. The first main objective involves the completion of a comprehensive literature review that identifies and reviews the state-of-the-art sustainable pavement best practices. This literature review is divided into five pavement related categories which examine: materials, design and construction techniques, maintenance and rehabilitation techniques, sustainability evaluation systems and carbon footprinting. The second objective involves the quantification of the environmental, economic and carbon footprint impacts of the reviewed pavement best practices; this evaluation is conducted using PaLATE. PaLATE is an excel based software developed at the University of California for evaluating the economical and environmental impacts of various pavement technologies. The third objective involves the utilization of GreenPave for evaluating the environmental friendliness of the analysed pavement best practices. The green discounted life cycle cost (GDLCC) is calculated to include the economic aspect of sustainability. The final objective involves the development of project and network level frameworks. These two frameworks are connected which forms the final framework for incorporating sustainability into City of Markham’s pavement engineering operations. Guidelines for the proper utilization of the developed framework are provided. Through the completion of the literature review it is concluded that there is a wide variety of sustainable pavement technologies that range from project design to pavement decommission. PaLATE analysis results indicate that warm mix asphalt and full depth reclamation are the most environmentally friendly construction and rehabilitation techniques, respectively. Including recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) within pavement mix designs reduces both costs and environmental impacts. Excluding microsurfacing, full depth reclamation was the least expensive rehabilitation technique while hot mix asphalt with RAP was the cheapest construction technique. The same initial construction and rehabilitation techniques are evaluated using the GreenPave rating system. Pervious concrete scored the highest rating under the initial construction category with warm mix asphalt a close second. Cold <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>recycling,</b> cold in place with expanded asphalt and full depth reclamation all scored the highest under the rehabilitation category. In the future, the City of Markham may wish to alter the GreenPave rating system to be more reflective of municipal practices as the current version of GreenPave is weighted more heavily on high volume roads. To include the economical aspect, the green discounted life cycle cost (GDLCC) is calculated for all techniques. Hot mix asphalt with RAP and full depth reclamation resulted with the lowest GDLCC in the construction and rehabilitation categories, respectively. Finally, the recommended project and network level frameworks for incorporating sustainability into the pavement engineering practices at the City of Markham are proposed. On the project level, GreenPave evaluation and project level GDLCC aid decision makers in determining the most sustainable project alternative. On the network level, a pavement management system (PMS) serves as the platform. The role of a PMS is to provide recommendations on when and where rehabilitation is required and which rehabilitation technique is the most sustainable. The cost effectiveness and network level GDLCC indicators also aid pavement engineers in making network level decisions. The project and network level frameworks are connected to provide a complete pavement management framework for incorporating sustainability. The framework provides economic benefits by increasing the effectiveness of budget allocation; this is accomplished by maximizing the overall condition index gained to dollar spent ratio. The environmental benefits of this framework include the minimization of harmful gas emissions, project carbon footprints and energy and water consumption. The social issues of pavement projects are unique to each case and therefore must be addressed case by case. A common starting point when addressing these issues is provided...|$|E

40|$|In 1973, Dr. Bill Rathje and his {{students}} at the University of Arizona began {{what was to become}} a two decade long investigation into American consumer waste habits. An archaeologist by profession, Rathje decided to adapt traditional archaeological methods and apply them to contemporary archaeological situations. This provided a platform for improving the understanding of what was really happening with, amongst other forms of waste, food at the consumer household level. The Garbage Project was able to study consumer behaviours directly from the material realities they left behind rather than from self-conscious self-reports of surveys and interviews. Using the same rationale, this study developed a profile of the packaged and processed food consumption in three regional Victorian municipalities. The main findings identified that consumers were limited to the food retail opportunities closest to their home and that they took greater care to wash out recyclables if they were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the <b>recycling</b> bin compared to the same item <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a kerbside landfill bin. There was also an apparent lack of understanding about appropriate food storage and buying for purpose, especially with regard to the volume of the item they purchased, which appears to result in partially used recyclable containers being put in the kerbside landfill bin. By understanding the nature of the packaging and food that has been thrown away, it is possible to develop a narrative around what people understand about food purchasing practices, longevity, storage and how they use it at home. This in turn can assist community engagement and education around nutrition, meal planning and purchasing as well as community waste education. garbage project; food waste; contemporary archaeolog...|$|R

A brute-force solution requires computational cost quadratic to input size and it does not scale well for large datasets. In view of this, we develop efficient R-tree based algorithms for computing RCJ, by exploiting the characteristics of the geometric constraint. We evaluate experimentally the efficiency of our methods on synthetic and real spatial datasets. The results show that our proposed algorithms scale well with the data size and have robust performance across different data distributions. 1...|$|R

The walls of the exhibition rooms were covered with posters and banners which competed for attention with the more traditional paintings of Otto Dix and George Grosz, although their subject matter [...] crippled war veterans and urban disorder [...] was suitably confrontational. Photomontage, a new medium recently seized upon by the dadaists, was prominently <b>placed,</b> <b>recycling</b> imagery from the illustrated press for satirical or absurd ends. And {{in the midst of all}} this could be found a tower of found objects, newspapers, and textual fragments assembled by Johannes Baader and known as the Plasto-Dio-Dada-Dram...|$|R
40|$|We <b>placed</b> <b>recycling</b> {{receptacles}} <b>in</b> {{two locations}} in academic buildings and studied re-cycling behavior within an ABA multiple baseline design. During baseline, <b>recycling</b> receptacles were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a central location. During the intervention, receptacles were moved into classrooms where beverages were primarily consumed. Baseline conditions were then reinstated. The percentage of cans recycled daily increased during intervention {{and returned to}} near-baseline levels during withdrawal. The percentage of cans discarded daily in the trash decreased during the intervention and increased to near-baseline levels during withdrawal. Implications of this study include making recycling more convenient in institutional settings. DESCRIPTORS: aluminum can recycling, stimulus control, response covariation Behavioral research has identified numer-ous interventions that increase recycling be-haviors. Austin, Hatfield, Grindle, and Bai-ley (1993) used signs and education to in-crease paper recycling in two college depart-ments. By placing signs over the trash containers and recycling containers, they in-creased recyclables from 5 1 % in baseline to 84 % in the experimental condition. WII-liams (199 1) reported that {{less than half of}} the students in residence halls recycled their daily newspapers. He suggested that a ma-jority of students would recycle if drop-off facilities were convenient for them. Brothers, Krantz, and McClannahan (1994) found that when <b>recycling</b> containers were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a central location of an office building, 28 % of recyclable paper was recycled. When the containers were moved closer to the workers, recycling increased to 88 % of all pap r, and similar results were maintained for up to 7 months afterward. The present study provided a systematic repl cation of the study by Brothers et al. (1994) appliedto student recycling behav-iors in university academic buildings. By mak g recycling more convenient, it was predicted that patrons of two academic buildings would increase their aluminum can recycling...|$|R
