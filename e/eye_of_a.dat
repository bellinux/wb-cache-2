A typhoon in November was the deadliest cyclone of the season, causing 49deaths as it crossed the Philippines.

5|$|Obama {{hosted the}} White House Passover Seder for all {{eight years of}} his administration. Among the annual traditions for the White House Seder were Obama's {{imitation}} of Pharaoh, Chaudhary's speech on the Hillel sandwich, and the hiding of the afikoman under the watchful <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Secret Service member. The Seder convened in the Old Family Dining Room and lasted for two hours. During Obama's last year in office in 2016, the Seder was held on April 26, the sixth day of Passover, due to Obama's previously scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on {{the first and second}} nights of Passover.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recently {{dead man}} (or if {{a dead man}} was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.|$|E

25|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird {{most closely}} {{resembles that of}} the reptiles. Unlike the {{mammalian}} eye, it is not spherical, and the flatter shape enables more of its visual field to be in focus. A circle of bony plates, the sclerotic ring, surrounds the eye and holds it rigid, but an improvement over the reptilian eye, also found in mammals, is that the lens is pushed further forward, increasing {{the size of the}} image on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Different traditions exist among, for example, sub-Saharan Africans, partly {{persisting}} in the post-colonial era. Whereas it is {{the norm}} among some ethnic and family groups including some Burkinabese and Nilo-Saharan (e.g. Nuba and Surma people) in daily life or on particular occasions not to wear any clothes or without any covering below the waist – for example, at highly attended stick-fighting tournaments well-exposed young men use the occasion to catch the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prospective bride.|$|E
25|$|The eye is also cleaned by tear {{secretions}} {{from the}} lachrymal gland and protected by an oily substance from the Harderian glands which coats the cornea and prevents dryness. The <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird is larger {{compared to the}} size of the animal than for any other group of animals, although much of it is concealed in its skull. The ostrich has the largest eye of any land vertebrate, with an axial length of 50mm (2in), twice that of the human eye.|$|E

Four years later, Shevchenko was on the Dynamo under-14 team for the Ian Rush Cup (now the Welsh Super Cup); he finished as the tournament's top scorer and was awarded a pair of Rush's boots as a prize by the then-Liverpool player.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 1995, the stripe {{theme was}} modified; the pointed 'G' was larger {{on the blue}} stripe against a {{computer}} generated multicoloured background and the 'G' was created by filming a large perspex 'G' with motion control photography. This ident was used, {{from a variety of}} angles, until 7 November 1999, by which point additional idents based on surreal surroundings, such as a fish blowing a bubble with a G inside, which floated to the surface, or a camera zoom into the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> housewife to reveal the G in her eye, were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Eyes {{in various}} animals show {{adaptation}} to their requirements. For example, the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{bird of prey}} has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, {{and in some cases}} can detect ultraviolet radiation. The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry. Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, {{but this is not the}} case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show.|$|E

25|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hook, {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, {{is the point}} where the hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of eyes to the hooks. Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|E

Luckily for Jim and Luke, the former Mrs. Grindtooth awakes as a Golden Dragon of Wisdom in China and can help them out with information and tells Jim how {{to find out about}} his origin. With the help of the Mandalanese emperor, Jim and Luke – and Princess Li Si as a stowaway – start their journey to meet the Wild 13 and rescue Molly. They encounter the pirates, who prove to be too much for them in battle. Molly is lost at sea, and all but Jim are captured and brought to the pirates' base, Castle Stormeye, a pinnacle of rock within the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> perpetual hurricane.|$|E
